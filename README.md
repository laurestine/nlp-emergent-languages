To do list:

*Note: The dates on the to-do list are flexible!*

*Note 2: We can ask each other for help with any to-do list item!*
1. First phase: Creating the basic ingredients.
   * Choose quantitative measures of linguistic structure, and implement them in Python.
     * Andressa will lead this.
   * Find appropriate English corpora (or perhaps just one big corpus), and access them in Python.
     * Laurestine will lead this.
   * Create a working prototype for an artificial language-learning setup in Python.
     * Hugo will lead this.
2. Second phase: Combining everything.
   * Choose which aspects of the language-learning setup to manipulate.
   * Measure these aspects on the corpora we have chosen.
   * Manipulate these aspects of the language-learning setup.
   * Collect our final data.
   * Write the report.
     * Due December 20th.
     * 4.5-5 pages, not including references.
     * Follows ACL 2020 style guidelines.
