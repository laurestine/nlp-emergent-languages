# nlp-emergent-languages

We will use this repository to share our code for our project for COMP550 Natural Language Processing.

The folder `corporawithmeaning` contains the corpus data from the Columbia Games Corpus we used, and the python scripts used to process this corpus to extract signal-to-noise ratio and compositionality metrics.

The folder `emergent-languages-experiments` contains notebooks related to simulation of emergent language evolution. See [the associated Weights and Biases page](https://wandb.ai/volut3s/nlp-emergent-languages) for further data from these simulations.

The folder `metrics` contains the code used to implement the compositionality metrics and apply them to the natural-language and emergent-language corpora.

### Running

Python 3.6+.

To install all the dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
