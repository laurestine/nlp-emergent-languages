ah I mean it's not necessary I don't really it's they're kinda open ended questions
yeah
how much do they want is the thing
like I think that's pretty good like that the family trees
I guess would it be redundant to say what exactly it means to be a big like in Zet
like as a mentor relationship
like that type of thin
or is that kinda understood
so hard to say
like to us , I would think it would be understood
unless we had , like , some other special relationship , that , you know what I mea
like
right
if they had some other specific sort of role
yeah
what was the total number of new members for the school yea
so you have to include Cathy because they distinguish between new members and initiates so it was eight last semester
yeah
and six this semester
oh no my little got in a car accident
she got before spring break
no again during break
wow
wow
so I just say the number just like tha
yeah
I didn't know
should I like put it in a sentence or somethin
umm
we can
should we assum
hmm
I'm just gonna write it out
we had seven initiates in the fall
we can't be too careful
we had seven initiates in the fall out of eight new members
and we have
should we say like that should we just give a date or should we say initiation is after
it's in mid April just say that
on April
this is what I'm gonna put up over my bed
yeah
so hot
he's got gray hair
I think it's just light in the picture
no I think he's got gray hair
no I think it's just the light in the picture
okay
frankly
around his temple
yeah I think that's just light in the picture
like right her
okay
and we currently have six
oh
isn't he , uh , pursuing Britney Spear
I heard he was
she sprained her back neck wrists and hands and bruised a rib
your littl
yes
she can't walk without being in pain
awoah
I think I should say our new member education program is scheduled to end in mid April not actually say anything about initiation itself
okay
um
this is the part where I get scared
did your chapter sponsor any educational programs this year on health or wellness issues such as alcohol , drugs , hiv_aids , eating disorders , abusive relationships , gambling , tobacco use or time management
no
no
kati did the love your body workshop
um
ah
that's not quite the same though
it's no , like
sponsoring would be like a campus wide event
right
did Panhe
well I guess if Panhel sponsors something we can't really claim it
yeah
um
um
hmm
I looked at that and I was like uh that sucks because I hope everyone says no
oh she hit a deer
oh my God
oh that's impossible to avoid
in a car acciden
oh yeah
yeah
oh
I mean
oh the deer was dead on the side of the New York freeway
five thousand dollars worth of damag
hmm
yeah
the reason's that he exploded in my car
the deer explode
apparently
that's disgusting
that's kinda ah
is there anything we can stretch
yeah I was just about to say that
um
hmm
hmm
I think the love your body workshop possibly touched upon eating disorders
sure the workshop is something
it's something
I wasn't there
were you there Maggie
no
um sure
well it can touch upon whatever we say it touches upon
so uh um
we can say that last semester we sponsored a chapter
this is why I need you
you're good at wording things
okay
I'd like to think so
that is my major
I know
that's why I was like Anna should help me
this application's a lot of work
it really is
I was like nope not doing it by myself
okay we sponsored a chapter workshop
um
wait he exploded on her car not in her car
yeah but it exploded
yeah
yeah , but exploded being the key word
yeah
I wouldn't even want my car after that
anna would be like all right done
time for a new car
okay
um
uh we sponsored a chapter workshop about body image
body image and overall health and well being
there ya go
that's beautiful
oh
he has Chicago
oh I wonder if he's got
I wanna see it in the theaters though again
I was gonna say , didn't you already see it
I did
I wanna see it again
I'll go with you
I haven't /
oh right because you haven't seen it
I know I know I suck
yeah you suck
um entitled eh
like new sentence
you wanna say like entitled the I Love My Body Workshop um
we can type
obviously
um the event
what did it d
um
strengthened self image
strengthened our sisters' self image and /
das
yeah
self image , and
and was educational
um it was a huge success and we plan to do it again in the future
I know it wasn't but
all right we can get rid of huge then
it was a success
it was a success
and we plan to hold this event again in the future
is that the sign from when your car got towe
the visitor parking on
no that's not
that's from a long time ago
okay I was gonna say that would have been a nice souvenir
I think instead I just have my uh bill
you got it all reimbursed /
I got reimbursed yeah
but it's not like the original bill
oh right
maggie I think after hanging out with you for a week straight I'm playing with my hair a lot more often
I know
I'm sorry
you have to smell
yummy
what is tha
you wanna smell xx
it does smell pretty
it's Charles Worthington Results
and it's the moisture seal glossing shampoo and the everyday shine conditioner
well
and when you're in the shower and you put it on it smells like men's cologne
I dunno why
yeah I was gonna say it does smell like
I don't think Jeff can complain about me smelling too great
I dunno if that's bad or
okay so
is there anything
I'm thinking that we can stretch something into being time management
just because like I know that our vice president is usually very active with the sisters individually
right , well
about time management
that will go in the scholarship section
oh , true
christy wrote like she actually didn't do what I asked her to do
she didn't put it into the form
but she wrote like a three page essay about
sweet
our scholarship so
we have good scholarship I think
yeah we have really good scholarship
she wanted an espresso , I'm like
but wh
it kept her up so long in Mexico , I couldn't sleep
you couldn't sleep or she couldn't slee
she kept pestering me
wait , the espresso kept her up so you couldn't slee
exactly
but what she said was that the espresso kept both of you up and both of you couldn't sleep
in a way
until three am
in a way it kept the both of us up
oh well , she wasn't that explicit
only she drank the espress
no , no , we both drank the espresso
she never drank espresso before
right , bad idea
can go for another couple more actually
ok lah , lets have a drinking contest
well , I wouldn't mind , it's just
how is i
it's not bad , know , it's actually good
it's just that it's a dollar thirtyfive for one shot , so I'm like
that's cheap
it i
it's fifteen pesos
I donno , I can't remember what the prices are in Singapore
fifteen pesos not cheap what
it's not cheap
mexican coffee is very strong
I was so happy to find out
very very strong
did I tell yo
they have two types
they have cafe americano , cafe mexicana
americano is the normal dilute one , then you get the mexicana
I saw that , I saw that in Paris as well , when I was in Paris
did I tell you about thi
I went into this coffee shop and I ordered coffee and the guy asked me whether I wanted american coffee or coffee
I was like of course I want coffee
no I don't get it , why would he ask you whether you wanted american coffee without knowing if you were american or not
it was a touristy place
oh , I see , I see
you know , you tend to
I suppose they tend to assume that whoever walks in is american , or has american tendencies
even though I was quite obviously asian
you're either american or japanese , that's it
there are only two people in this world
and you said of course you want coffee
er , yah , so the guy served me the french what the french drink
do you have kopi
no , they don't
I would say no , they don't have kopio
their default idea for coffee is espresso
that's kopio what
I thought you meant they added milk into everything
no , there's a difference
no , no , kopio is just coffee without milk , righ
ok , if you refer to that as kopio , then ok , fine
yah what , it is what
no , not exactly , it has to be prepared in that hawker center style
in that mug you know the mugh with the indentations on the side
yes yes yes the glass mug
the sugar cane center mug
with the insulating tape on the handle
no no no no no
nowadays that's what they come as but what five , six years ago it
it used to be a bigger version of this righ
that's the way it should be yah man
and then you get this plastic spoon that's like a smaller version of your soup spoon remember tha
yah , that is the way to go
and then my grandfather would pour it out of the saucer
my father would pour it out in the saucer then I would drink it from the saucer then he would drink it from the cup , yah
yes yes , that's how we started drinking coffee righ
that's how I started drinking tea
older relative says want or not , I pour it into the I pour it into the saucer for you , then you drink it from the saucer
doesn't taste as good anymore you know
when I was growing up it tasted so much better
it always does lah
actually when I was growing up everything tasted good , yah , you're right
you usually reach a certain stage in your life when you start to differentiate between things tasting good and bad , as in the same kind of food served to you
lets say you get like three plates of char kuay teow from different places , I dunno , that's what happens for me
vegetables always tasted bad to me
because if we make it flat , the back leg is going to have to go through the bag
yeah
that's why I ask
that's the only thing is like , the way our structure works , like the way it's rigid and stuff , kind of gets messed up
so
I think we could keep the v shape
ah , I think the v is fine
okay
um
the one thing we definitely have to do though is lower the thing
we could do that
I think we definitely should do that
cause the
so brooms if it's the long brooms we're talking about they're not very high anyway
yeah
yeah
they're only like that long
so if they're only gonna touch the ground , or like barely touch the ground , then it has to be like , wha
two inches off the ground , mayb
at most
I don't know
we can probably almost get it down to like an inch off the ground
something like that
I don't think we need it that
but I don't think I don't , I don't think we need it quite that extreme
something like two or three inches three inches maybe
three inches off the ground would be good
I think the lower the better , just because that means they'll be left less leaves collected in front at the end
does that mean we
and it also means there's we want our prototype to work on flat surface
lower the better
how /
only on flat
yeah , that's true
how're we gonna tackle flat surfaces the
hm
what do you mea
or , not uneven surfaces , sorry
well because the tines aren't gonna be touching
like how're we gonna try
it's gonna be like
yeah
a centimeter or two off the ground
yeah
the brushes , like , it could conform to the surface
yeah , the brush will catch anything
that's uneven
so it'll just have the brushes
a little bit bent
well yeah , it's gonna bend back because of the grass
it's gonna bend back naturally but make it like prebent though
oh
is what I'm saying
like so if it were flat even ground it would be bent back already a little bit
and then like if it's like a little bit of a hill or a mound or whatever
I think it'll just bend back because , uh , it's going against the grass
mmhmm
it's gotta be some sort of
like , I'm assuming it's soft bristle
yeah
because hard bristle is gonna damage the grass so we wouldn't
yeah
wanna use that anyway
yeah
but like yeah , even if it's straight down in the beginning , once it starts moving , it'll like curve back anyway
but hopefully it won't curve back too much
so we need to get some brushes or brooms or whatever
yeah
we need to look into materials that we could use for that too
what do you mean material
well , you can get brooms with all kinds of different stuff
I mean /
you can get like
different kinds of bristles you mean
yeah
yeah
you can get like , horsehair brooms
you can get like
right , right
fake horsehair
well
ah , you can get like
let's go with the cheapest well something that's stiff but , you know , well also flexible
well I don't know what's out there I don't know
so , balanceful
I have , I have a broom that's made out of basically just straw , kinda and I mean , it works great as a broom , but definitely wouldn't work for this
so
okay
alright , so what are we asking tomorrow Steif
so
frame rigidity
rigidity
what time is he availabl
one thirty to three
one thirty to three
so we're going straight after our classes
straight after classes
I have a little thing , so I'll be a little late
so I was thinking one forty five
I im'dyou one forty five , righ
how about
I guess so
we just go at twelve then
how about
or /
we go
two at two
yeah
okay
yeah , how about we go to Newell Simon
okay
get food
yeah
and we meet you there at two or something
okay
so does that sound goo
do you have a lunch break at any time during the da
alright
um
so what are we asking him
uh frame frame rigidity
uh frame longevity I dunno
do you think shocks would be goo
well
well those are the things we would have to ask him about
we , we'll tell him we should estimate how much weight there's going to be on the bolts
okay
and probably ask him about sheer of the bolts , at the bottom , where it's connected to the uh the runners
and then the other thing is bending of the uh the frame
as it's pulling the ne
as the ropes are pulling the sides forward and the bag is pulling the center back
yeah
slight will it go like this eventually sometime
crunch or something like that
because I mean we're already like this
like
it's going like that kind of
well I dunno , maybe I dunno
so
cause the bag is attached all around the frame
the thing is , do we really need
well I think
to ask him about all of those thing
well
like we should be able to do that ourselves
right
that stuff we should , but like if there's any uncertainty
no , but he , he can give us advise , like /
like a good way to estimate i
ah But yeah , like a good way to estimate
or a better equation to use , or /
we should /
something
wait , we can't estimate that no
how heavy is our thin
twenty , thirty pounds mayb
uh I guestimated guess and estimated twenty
that's
okay twenty
but
that's something we should do too , we should figure out how heavy our thing is
but , like if we have the weight , we have three points
assuming each point has the same load on it , if it's a flat surface
then we could take the one in the back , which is a straight down force , and then the other two , is like an angle force and the angle we kinda know
so we should be able to find the sheer stresses on it
or we should as him if that is completely correct , I dunno
beause the bag isn't , you know , attached at the center , it's attached all around
and what's the other thing I remembe
in the first few days in the nursery we had some relatives
but when you weren't with me and you were in the nursery and they went in there and they saw you like lifting up your head as a little bit and turning it a little bit
more than most babies most babies don't do that right away
and just trying to see as much as you could because you were excited about having come into the world
and you wanted to see as much of it as you could
and it was just a very exciting thing meeting you at that time and getting to know you
as an infant
and it was amazing
so lets see
what else
you wanna know what you were like when you were littl
and you were growing up
you were easy in some ways
you were really easy because you didn't cry very much
you had a melodious and sweet voice and you used it to cry just enough to get my attention to do something you needed to have done
and then you would quiet down and look peaceful and happy because you got what you needed
hugging you hugging was always wonderful
I remember you being draped over my shoulder a lot
because that was the position that we enjoyed
you enjoyed it and I enjoyed it
and so you'd have your tummy against my body and you'd have your head against my shoulder and you'd fall asleep on my shoulder
for a few years
and I think those are times when we both felt very peaceful and very happy
and I know it was for me some of the most beautiful days of my life
okay
you want me to move on here with what was happening little later on
sure I'll do that
um well there are some things I feel a little bad about that if I could do it over again I woulda wanted to improve
but whatever was not quite good maybe it had good things that went along with it too
you see I didn't drive a car you remember that
you remember tha
sure
of course
I didn't drive the car until you were in kindergarten
so we were sorta stuck in the house
more than most people and just sort of dependent on who was in our neighborhood
and um yeah we met a few neighbors with children , and they weren't necessarily the choices of people that we would have chosen if we had a car , but we did spend some time with them and it wasn't so bad and it was nice walking around the neighborhood we did a lot of walking remember you were willing to walk
and after the stroller and you got walking we did a lot of walking
and it was nice days and pretty days and enjoying the nature
tryin' ta think
but we couldn't do a lot of things because we didn't have the car
so um ok anyway in that time period that was when your sister was born we spent a lot of time with you you learned to read when you were very young because we spent time together doing that and
you were smart anyway
we found a way to go to the gym school
finally when you were getting almost old enough to get to kindergarten
because you had never had nursery school you never had preschool or nursery school or anything we got you into the gym school one day a week by taxi
and it was good at first
you were so enthusiastic
you loved doing everything that they had you do
until there was this boy who was nasty
and the school wanted to separate the two of you
and we couldn't do it because there was only one time slot when I could get you over to the gym and then Dad could come by the taxi and then Dad could come and pick you up
boy
it was too bad because it sort of spoiled this wonderful gym experience that you were having
and I was wishing that I could drive and I could have more flexibility and you were sort of stuck with this situation but it was still better than not doing it at all and then you went to kindergarten
and then guess what , you were a little too smart for kindergarten
by that time kindergarten into first grade and then of course you skipped a grade
which in itself was a good thing and a bad thing all at the same time because socially it was a little tough
and right at that period of time Grampy also died
so a lot of things were happening
and you had a little bit of a hard time but you got through it
you managed
you were amazing
you were amazing
and you conquered what needed to be conquered with all the emotions and you got through it and you were successful , and you started to make friends
and eventually you really made some good friends
you really did
it took a while but one by one you picked up good friends who are still your friends
remember Alliso
your friend Allison she started way back there in first and second grade
and then you picked up more friends as you went along and they're still your friends I think its amazing that you picked up friends way back then and they're still with you
so many years later and I think its wonderful and I hope they stay friends with you for the rest of their lives and your life
alright can you still hear m
I feel my voice is like
I need a breath
okay here I am back
okay um okay
well anyway my point is sometimes that if I had to do it over again if I had to do it over again wouldn't I want to make it more perfect for you
wouldn't I want to get you more lessons wouldn't I want to get you more more freedom of movement where we could travel more where you could see more places and sure I would
on the other hand maybe we can look back and we can say alright whatever it was it was maybe there were some things that were a little bit restrictive maybe but maybe because of that there were also things that were good and we could get closer
and we could we did other things and you became more independent and more diligent and things may have happened
closeness with each other that wouldn't have happened otherwise
maybe you wouldn't have ended up able to be who you are as easily if you had been out there with me driving you around maybe you wouldn't have become who you are
maybe you would have become a slightly different person
so who knows
and so I would like to think that whenever anything happens that's sort of not perfect , that there is some perfection to it anyway
and all I know is this
all I know is that Courtney you have turned into a beautiful wonderful person
you're pretty independent now
you're diligent you're reliable you're successful but you're warm and you're loving and you're a joy to be near
you're always a joy to be near and to spend time with
I love being with you
I miss you out there in Pittsburgh because I wish you were here but I'm I'm proud of you for what you're doing
ya know it's really distracting that you're always cleaning this area

okay , allright , what's next on the agenda , uh , folks
sigh
um , I don't know
I thought that would take a long time
hhh
yeah
hhh
do you , do you want to do this agai
you're awake now
no , do you want to do it agai
hhh
I'll pass
hhh
hhh
maybe it goes here
maybe it goes here
oh that's weird
under her
yeah
okay
one more
oh oh my
well it is sorta too bad we don't have a nifty video to watch
yeah , I guess the place isn't open , hu
well , it may be
well I really wanted to see a movie I must tell you that
I even wanted to go out and see one
and it is early enough to still , to do that
um , well , we could , well let's see
you know what , that movie that's on at the Arts Cinema
the Arts Cinema
somebody Who Wasn't There , or
uh , i , the paper's out her
uh , Idunno
it's in the
living room
living roo
you both did real well , together , I thought
really good
yeah
the only one
we were pretty good
the only one that really
sort of embarrasses me is turgid and turbid
cause the other one you might expect not to get
I was a lil'
yeah I was a little surprised you didn't get that one , I must admit
yeah , The Man Who Wasn't There
is on and Glitter is on at seven fifteen at the Art Theater
and The Man Who Wasn't There
is sort of a take off I think on films noires
um
man Who Wasn't
well it doesn't have It doesn't
it was time the first time
that's the other side
oops
because uh , uh , The one that's on , um , at five thirty at the Art Theater called Glitter
says
a truly dreadful film about a singer's rise to fame , with Mariah Carey looking as though she's afraid of the camera all the way through
oh
but , it doesn't say
hhh
oh , they also have other ones , like Monster , is a fourstar movie and so is
yea
so is that movie about
oh , The Monster is cute
it's , you know , that's a , a children's movie , righ
mhmm have you seen it
no but it's supposed to be cute
it's , it's
um , wait minute , found it
it's all computer animated , like Toy Story
okay , it's on at Hoyt's and it's on
well , it's on at seven fifteen at Town Square
ummm
it depends on if you want to see a kids' movie
it prolly won't be quite as good as Shrek
did you ever see Shre
no , did you see i
uh huh , d'you see i
yeah
shrek was , is on at the Cinema Saver , but only in the afternoon
mmm
well , yeah
toda
I saw that on the airplane , flying somewhere
really , huh
oh reall
sss
where were you goin
oh , Germany or something
oh , yeah
hm , did you all see Serendipit
yes
yeah
it was kinda not that good hhh
it was okay
bandits
oh , Bandits , very good
a meaty love story full of odd , well developed character
well , let's see what time it's on
bandits is on at seven fitee ah
seven fifteen Friday through Sunday
and today'
thursday
six fifteen , Monday through Thursday
nnunno around six fourtyfive
so it's probably not on
that's at the Cinema Saver that's too bad
I guess we could call 'em to make sure
or we could call the Video King
a meaty love story full of odd , well deve well developed characters is a source of unexpected humor in this quirky , delightful film about a trio of unlikely bank robbers
too bad
call Video King for what purpos
see if they're open
I betcha they're open
they're probably open
oh I bet they're open and also
reall
even on Thanksgivin
yeah
yeah , I'm about to decide , too , that um , Hollywood Video has more choices
it's true
I just figure Video King is the smaller chain
hhh
but it's true Hollywood Video probably does have more choices
d'you have a Hollywood Video car
mhmm
kay
I'll go with you , if we do that
we can all go
do you want to do tha
okay , sure
yeah
yeah , I mean that
that may be more fun , sitting around here , than going to a movie theater what do you thin
I think so
I think so
yeah we could see this The Man Who Wasn't There
I don't know , we could make that at seven fifteen
uh , Bandits is on there at nine thirty , but that's a little late
yeah
the Man Who Wasn't There is a fun movie
mhmm
what's The Man Who Wasn't Ther
well , I don't know , they don't have a write up about it , that I can find
oh yeah
that's the one with Kevin Spacey mayb
no , um , uh , no that's something about
it's the Cohen Brothers
kevin Spacey's an alien that's another one , I think
oh , yeah , that's somethin' different
it , no , there's no write up this time about it
unless it's under the
no , man
no it , it goes from Heist to Monsters
they had it written up last time
they had a whole , full review of it last time , and they kinda , and they liked it
though the New Yorker doesn't give it a real good review the New Yorker's pretty oh wait lminute
they call it
I know
here it is
sorry , it's four , it gets four stars
a barber's plan for blackmail uh , backfires in this superb filme noire written by the Cohen brothers
starring Billy Bob Thornton , Frances McDormond , and James Gal Galdolfini
hmm
what does it say agai
it's a good movie
the real question is whether you wanta
it's rated R for violence
a barber's plan for blackmail backfires in this superb film noire written by the Cohen brothers
what's a filme noir
black film sort of dark humor
yeah , you 'member that Hard Hard Rock West film that we saw
in New York that tim
yes
that's a filme noire
I see
I always confuse that with The Rock
hhh
hhh which is a very different film
um , okay
it's really
who are the Cohen brother
they're the ones that did Fargo
oh , I see
and Frances McDormond was she was the woman in Fargo
that sort of film
hmm , pretty neat movie
mhmm , mhmm
so it's , it's really a matter of weighing that in particular against here , and a might be yet unknown
yeah , I mean renting a video is kind of nice
yeah , I think we kind of want to rent one
we can sit around and stuff
so why don't we all go
mmm okay
let's all go and pick out a movie
it'll be an outing
because it's our outing for the day
hhh
mhmm
and we'll tell the person

and the best Alumna advisor goes to Nicki
it's lost , per se , in the piece , just to the general appearance of , there , uhm ,
I'm , confused by that a little bit
because you say you want more room to breathe but then you're you're sayingthat the individual is lost , and so
well I'm saying
why , like , y'know , to to make it more individualized , to associate a person with it makes it more specific , not more open and , so , how do how do you how do you give us more room to breathe , how do you give the implied person or the viewer or the artist more room to breathe while making it at the same time more specific and more individualized
well , you're , like , tagging on these objects a kind of like specific image
you're not letting the pieces illustrate their own individuality when you , when you put these images on them , you're kind of , like , this was found here , y'know , this is what it is , y'know , and it doesn't , like , and it doesn't let the worn quality of the shirt speak for itself , or , y'know i
but
but it sounds like you're you're proposing two different options for the way these things can work , and you're siding with one of the options , and option one is that you use the photographic information to make the objects reveal more of what they are uhm , option two is more of a contrast kinda thing where where the images are very diffferent from the objects that they're on and they reveal something else through that contrast , so i guess does anybody else see the contrast in a different way than Jb is there another read on this thing
to compare with jb's
I have a , a less of a problem with the images on the objects and more of a formal issue , the one thing i would ask is i think what's beautiful about is that you stop seeing the objects and each one of these images becomes like , what we project onto things and i would just like to see them fill the object , that's all
when they do , I think they're really powerful , because it's like , one has stopped seeing and they're just projecting this nostalgia of like , loss or emptiness or wanting to leave that the railroad has been it's it's i like it because it has this kind of irony the railroad has been abused as a metaphor , and yet onthese objects the images are kinda so beautiful that they hold to where you almost have to cope with that still , as a potential metaphor but , when it's framed like this , to me , then it becomes more of a picture and when it starts to fill that space like there on the skateboard even on the , uh , scale then it seems to just be it seems to you almost lose what the object is and it just , all things become surfaces for the projection of desire or something , what we'd like to have happen so
alright , Stu don't you like Minneapolis
oh let me tell you how much I like that city which we call Minneapolis
a lot , that's how much
alright , so you're all like , let me
yeah , I get out , kinda early , the twelfth I think
and then I want to go there and start working before the end of May
okay , um yeah , I have finals until the thirteenth
and program doesn't start until June sixteenth
and you cannot vacation after the sixteent
no
which sucks 'cause it would be better to
start early and then leave and come back
like , i don't know
perhaps I could , go somewhere with you , like , the week before your program what's the sixteenth , is that a Monda
I dunno
let's find out
mmmmhmmm yes , it's a Monday
okay , ummmm
there's a lot of weeks in here , dude
one week , two weeks
yeah , that's like a month
three weeks , four weeks
yeah that's , that's four weeks , five weeks
that's like , four and a half weeks
yeah
so that's yeah , I'm not gonna not work for a month
yeah
that would suck
um
I'm not gonna sit in Minneapolis looking at your pretty , pretty face for a month though
so you could play in Minneapolis
play in Minneapolis , by myself
I don't know , uhhh , like I could start working as late as maybe Monday the twentysixth
maybe Monday the twentysixth
uhhh , were you planning on going to New Haven at al
uhh , I have to go for like , a quick haircut , dental appointment , and dermatologist thingy
oh yea
yeah
okay
so , like , were you planning on like , spending time , being like hellooo family and friends
uhhh , my mom wants a week , I'm going for like , three or four days
okay , so iunno
like , I figure if we arrive , we drive up over the weekend , to arrive on the twentysixth , and I
start working on the twentyeighth , that'll work for me
mmmkay
like , I wanna make sure we drive up together because that's a long drive
like , my Mother says her family used to do it in three days from Cleveland
I think your Mom's crazy
yeah she also said it was onethousand miles
how long is i
I don't know we could look it up
let us use the internet
ahhh
whoa , this is not my keyboard , Stu
I'm sorry
this is very confusing
I'll grab the right one next time
yeah , dude , I'm all tryin' to find the arrow keys
yeah , those are really annoying arrow keys
yeah dude
wha
I don't know , you use the arrow keys a lot
yeah I do you never realize it until it's gone
wha
don't piss Kerry off
oh , I did not realize
whatever
you're repeating yourself
yeah , i thought that would help the dialogue , you know , emphasis
righto
something righto
uhhh it is eighthundredseventyseven miles
that's a long way
it's not completely ridiculous from onethousand
anyway
look at this calendar more
yes , we drive up over the weekend , so then I'd say no more than two days
okay I was also thinking like if I , I could visit Warren
you know
yeah
sometime so like I could drive up there with you , and spend like time settling in and being like oh , Stu , like that
and then , um , like , leave and come back in time , like take a plane from Minneapolis to Las Vegas and back
yeah , I think that might be good
so you'd go like , first or second week in April er March
may , June
may , June , yeah , ha hah , good job , ummm
yeah , I could totally do that
that way I won't be sitting in Minneapolis bored forever
alright , so I'll tell her like , so when do you want to arrive the
arrive at uhhh
minneapolis
ummm
cause , like , I really don't wanna spend more than like that I wanna get out of New Haven by like the sixteenth
by the sixteent
mmmhmmm so I don't know , I could go and hang with Rori for a week
uhhh , well I don't know
I don't know before you were talking about you wanted to spend like some ridiculous number of weeks , like fifteen weeks doing work this Summer
yeah
like there's not even fifteen weeks in the world , in the summer , is ther
uhh , I don't know , that was the number of weeks she said
oh , I see
so , I don't know we could , like you could , we could leave Pittsburgh such that you could start work on the twentysixth
like we could leave Pittsburgh on the twentieth or something
mmhmm drive up , arrive on the twentysecond , settle in over the weekend , start on the twentysixth
mmmhmm
man , I have a long time in Minneapolis with nothing to do
I really don't think it would be that bad , you've got like a new city and a car and nothing to do
yeah maybe I'll just be like lalalalalalala
there'll probably be other kids from your program who already arrived , and you can go play with them
well , if I know who they are
yeah , you could find them probably
I don't know about that , Stu
find some punk rock , shows something like that
in Minneapolis
minneapolis punk rock
yeah , okay so that would be like one week , two weeks , three whole weeks , and some extra that I would be sitting in a city
being like I'm sure here I could spend , like , at most one of them in Las Vegas
yeah , so it's two weeks , of , nothing to do , except , have fun
except have fun , maybe I'll go to Las Vegas and then , like , drive out to California , by myself
go swimming
mmmkay Rori
so you would , you'd want to get out of there like the week from first the seventh or something
yeah I guess so
that would probably work
I could even get to Minneapolis later than that
rori , that's not cool , cause then I have to do all the moving in
well , I could
I don't know I could buy way too many plane tickets and have no money
wait , I don't understand what are you thinkin
um , I just like , I could go there with you and move in , and drive there with you and everything
and then I can like , go to Las Vegas , visit Warren , then go back to Dc or something like that and then fly back to Minneapolis
woah , three plane tickets
three plane tickets , that's a lot
I've only been on planes twice ever
yeah reall
yeah
wow
ah , to and from Hawaii or somethin
no , to and from Denver Colorado
when did Hawaii come in plac
uh , took boats
oh wow where did you go to from Denver Colorad
um , my sister , uhhh in like senior year or something of high school , my sister's company had this like , convention in Denver Colorado
that they were hosting , and she was like come with me and sit behind this table and look pretty and get paid , like fifteen dollars an hour
for doing wha
sitting behind a table and looking pretty
no , really
like , really that's it , like people come up and say hey , how you doin' , I be like okay
then they'd leave that was it
woah , are you , you're wha
no , I would like , I don't know , I was
you were a spokesperso
something where they'd like uh
a booth gir
information person or something
mmmkay
yep
that's pretty cool the company gave us like fiftyfive dollars a day on which to spend , food
mmmhmmm
so , everyone got ridiculous food at the time
cool
that's a lot of money they
fiftyfive dollar
yeah
seriously
I could spend fiftyfive dollars a day on food
you'd buy , eat like very nice food all the time , man though it's just you , it's not you and anyone else , it's just you
yeah
like , you always eat that much , of course
I could always , I could probably yeah twenty dollars on a meal is
a lot
that's nice food
yeah , that's nice food and you do that like
I don't know , I could spend
you know , three times a day
fifteen on breakfast , thirty on dinner
that leaves like , ten dollars for lunch , it's a little short
it's a little shor
jesus
of like , what I would consider very good food
I don't know
it would probably be like , sixtyfive a day I think as much I as I would want to
like , everyone kept on like , asking restaurants if they could buy bottles of wine , and take them home
so that they could , you know
yeah
put on their food allowance the bottles of wine and everything
yeah and the restaurant sai
for no apparent reason

this is really retarded
let's pick out a new wedding dress
ahahaha
haha
oohh uh
this is ridiculous
wh
oh my god , I'm getting here's here's a someone for you
I'm getting married this summer and plan to wear strappy sandals with my gown
do I need to wear hose with my shoe
if so , what styl
they start off okay and then they quickly go downhill
wearing hosiery with sandals is not the most attractive option
but it is more comfortable
you're going to have those shoes on for at least five hours , and
wearing hose may cut down on sweating , chafing , and blistering feet
if your feet do those things , they're gross and should be amputated
what isn't that what Sara would do , she would wear , um
yes
shoe
those shoes and wear
I kinda
this is ridiculous , this is all ideas for Philadelphia and
why would you be grandm
know what's really ridiculous look at that
the carrots
yes , but that's the dressing they put on it , you know the
ranch ◉whatever◉ dressin
you know
baa /
little bit ever so who the hell
look at this , how much do you think this ring cos
how much do you think this ring cos
holy
ahhh
j
j Lo has
like a sixty eight carat pink
is that what they do with gol

oh , right , right , right
yes , yes , that's true
it's like when you're talking about ah
you know , when you talk about um
doing something , doing something that previously thought you couldn't do

once , my professor eh does some paper about him
he was a member of Academy of Science , American Academy
he was invited in Russia
and in newspaper they publish something about him
he brought this paper for me and he told me "
Could you translate i
I said
oh , yeah
I took it
oh newspapers are hard
I was not able
I told him in general what it is , but it was not a translation
you know what I did it
you gave him a summary Yeah
yes , You know what I didn't even realize it
newspaper articles are very difficult
I thought
okay , I speak fluently English
oh oh oh
were you trying to translate into English or into Russia
I was shocked , yeah
into Englis
I was not able
I brought it home
simon helped me
it took us probably thirty minutes , about one hour to translate very small article because he needs to know exactly terms
for him it was important how they see him
because he wanted to be a member of Russian Academy of Science
for him it was , how you know , they present
perceived him , Right
that means I cannot in just general terms tell him what this is about
right , right , right
and he realize it right away
he told me
you know what
you told me shortly , but please take it home , and translate it for me
since that time , I thought I would not go to this business

indy band that's like really popular and I just found out about like three days ago
you're like , I know them
I know , seriously , I know them now
I mean I will see anything if it's free
that's true
that's the point of like carnival , is to get the entertainment for free
I've never participated at all
I know , I don't understand how
like my favorite thing though , like my favorite thing , is the bar be ques
I just want barbeques
the French girls are excited about that

what
not morning but like when we wake up
like what time would people be comin
we could have it around like three ish
three is
yeah because if we have it around three ish and it goes on it's sort of like it sort of takes care of lunch and dinner in one , ya kno
and it also doesn't like make it a party time like

yeah why do you hate i
I just hated all the people that worked there
oh , you're like
you're like , big tits , small blah blah
yeah like not good Like it's certainly I dunno to me it's like part of the Shadyside scene that people are like oh , I'm fabulous
is that how it is over ther
yeah
and I'm just like you're in Pittsburgh
is it really is it expensiv
I dunno , I only ordered beers
I would imagine it would be
and have you ever eaten at Walnut Gril
I haven't eaten there , I heard it was okay
it's not even okay
reall
no and people like fawn over it I really don't understand but
just because of where it is
where it is
and it's shadyside and you can go there and be fabulous
and be seen
I like PDC it's cheap
I like PDC , I dunno if it's really that cheap is i
well , it's it's like cheap for Shadyside
it's the same company
is i
spending three dollars on a half a sandwich or like you know ha like
yeah
during every day and only three dollars on like a whole sandwich from nine to eleven is like kind of peakish time isn't i
I didn't understand that check at all last night
me neither
like two of our drinks were on there we couldn't tell if it was three fifty before the promotion after the promotion
and then there was like eleven unexplained dollars
three times four is twelve plus three is fifteen no , that makes sense then
does i
yeah
oh well our drinks were probably
four fifty donw to three fifty
no I think three fifty down to two fifty
so round it up to three bucks
so times four is twelve and another /
four bucks and that
but why wasn't it liste
I dunno
well
claire isn't the most

I don't know she needs , like , everything her way she needs everything to be nice and planned out for her
I don't know
so if we travel , i'll have to be like in some really expensive hotel and we'll , like , plan weeks ahead of time

lack Lackner was ther
yeah he didn't do anything though , he stood there like drill seargent Bob , i mean he didn't say anything the whole time
Zim and like
he just wants to see who's coming probably
like Zim and Botha those guys run it , he's just there to take attendence
because Zim and all those guy's is running
they made up all the drills and everything
when Botta's , when Botta's there we go crazy
but it's not like Lackner does anything
he said he went and watched the Pitt speed training

I dunno my dad knew the guy
there's no money involved
yeah , that's the only thing that sucks
well still , then , that should put your foot in with something else
I have get like , i have to do my own like thing
I don't know we'll see how far , well how far is U , University of Miami from your hous
half hour
that's not bad
I gotta talk to this girl online , she's money in the bank
are you workin
yeah i'm working for that same guy I worked for last summer , that civil engineer , pretty much just outside all day
diggin in the dirt
when are you gunna work out
I work out after work , like six or seven at night
how tired are yo
well , prodigiously tired
your workouts must suck then
no , actually they don't
I get myself pumped up , ready to go
we start at like , Iwork from like six in the morning until like freakin' four five
that's a lot of hours
yeah
five days a week , we go lift
yes you are a freak of nature
thank you
your eyebrows are growing back though
I had them done
there is no violence
I had
wait
I had them done over break I was growing them and then they got really bushy and I went and had a woman do them and this is the shape she gave me
right , they're present and that's a good thing
thank you
before you had them
I had them so thin
so that they covered a third of your eye
I know I liked the thin look for awhile now I like 'em thicker I guess but yeah
you need to have them present
I know
like
actually there's this one salon I went into here in Pittsburgh , and they're like yeah 'n if you come in and get your eyebrows waxed we'll make them darker like they would dye the eyebrow color
they can do tha
that's weird
I guess so
yeah I guess they can
'n I thought that would be kinda neat cuz like I do have very light eyebrows 'n even no matter how thick they get if the sun hits them or light hits them in a way it doesn't matter how much hair is there like you won't see them
yes but you have a better chance of seeing them now that they're there
I understand
then when they were actually gone
thank you mister brian
it's better than like those people that like get rid of them completely and then draw them in with pencil
oh my god that looks's so horrible
that's so bizarre
what are they thinkin
I don't know
man
same thing you were thinking when you plucked 'em down to nothing
no I kept plucking because I wanted to make them even and then I would like pluck one wrong and it would have to and then it would just
that's like this one girl Murray and I used to know
it was like you just keep going
you could like this one time we were at dinner and he like just looked at her like across the table just started staring at her and she's like what what are you looking at 'n she got all self conscious and he's like your eyebrows are uneven and she like was like so upset and embarrassed that she like ran away and left the table 'n
oh my god that's horrible
murray has a tendency of make girls cry
really
it's a a ya know a talent
because he just says the wrong thing
he's blunt
very blunt
nah , I mean he's he's getting better but ya know sometimes when when he doesn't care he can be pretty blunt
actually he was never blunt when I was around
because he liked you
oh
if you if you bother him or piss him off
then he'll be blunt
then he he can go out of his way to be mean to you
gottcha
yeah
I thought he was sweet
he's a sweet guy
he is
murray's a teddy bear
is he
but yeah he's just rough around the edges
I understand most guys are
you would've whipped him into shape
would I no
yeah
I'm not very good at whipping guys
whip it whip it good
I'm not very good at that
well
I don't have like the patience or desire to whip a guy
I know you need to find the guy that like is exactly suited for you because nobody else will really do because you can't can't work with them
but I won't change them
there's like one person in the world who's really gonna work for you
I know isn't that horrible
I guess
'cuz it makes my chances of finding them so much harder
no I just think that some people don't realize that not everybody's perfect and you're never going to find somebody that's perfect for you
you just have to find somebody that makes you happy
compatible
and you can you know you can change and evolve and interact with
I understand that nobody's perfect I'm not even close to saying I'm perfect I know I have plenty of faults
people like have this thing where they like exactly imagine who who it is that they're going to be with like he has to be this this this ya know like that's not how it is ya just
I know I just ask for simple things and I just don't I don't think I've gotten the simple things I mean
maybe you're not looking in the right places
maybe I'm not
maybe I've just or maybe it's just a matter of the guys I attract I don't know
maybe
I mean
I don't know I thought Andy was a a close approximation but like just screwed it up you like
I know I screwed it up
you just didn't do much with it
I know I screwed it up majorly at the movies
I realize that
no , it wasn't definitively at the movies
it was an in it was over time because he kept coming back you just ya know you kept discouraging him
I didn't mean to
I just guys can't play a game with me because I'm not good at reading signals so they just have to be forward I just need a guy to say look I want to go out ya know and I would give him so many opportunities
but then when they so look Carolyn I want to have sex you'll be like no that's a little bit too forward
because that's a little bit too quick in a relationship I guess I have an idea of what I want my first time to be and
and we've already we've just discussed this
and we've already
I'll tell you right now , it's not going to be that way
it's not going to be that way
so then don't even worry about it just do it
I know , but now
oh wait wait wait do it when you're ready but I mean like , you know what I mean
yeah I know but
you know what I mean though don't have expectations for how it's gonna be
I'm kinda ready to I'm just really kinda ready too
dan Dan's got that offer on the table for ya
I know Dan has the offer on the table
you would make Dan's millennium for that one
I'm sure I would
I guess
dan would be a happy boy
I guess I'm just very self conscious about my body right now 'cuz I think I put some weight on and so I'm like I know it doesn't matter does it
you don't eat
I do eat
you can't gain weight if you don't eat
I just ate tonight
that's true but , just because you ate once doesn't mean you're a healthy eater
I got you a book , strong women eat well
did you read i
yes
and what did you lear
strong women eat well
and do you consider yourself a strong woma
no
but you're ok with tha
no , I'm trying harder to eat better
are you reall
I really am
I am
I'm making sure I eat every three four hours
what's gonna happen when you go to like Cleveland and you live by yourself and you don't have anybody to be like Carolyn you're being a freak about this
because I'm actually noticing in ya know like myself that ya know I'm doing these things that are bad and it actually makes me happier when I eat
yes , because you're not walking around all day like what's that feeling in my stomach is that hunger that kinda irritates me this is uncomfortable I'm in a bad mood because I'm not eating
'cuz I'm not hungry
because I'm also letting myself eat what I enjoy more than ya know denying myself
I'm willing to betchou that if you eat what makes you happy but while you're healthy and you exercise you'll look better than when you starve yourself
it'll be fine
I know I started to do that
I really did
and I'm sure that's going to work out for ya you just have to stick to it
I know
some people
and every now and then they have this this Dilbert head in the design office that they keep filled with candy and every now and then I'll sneak in and steal like a Reese's pieces peanut butter cup ya know like one of those peanut butter cups that are like
the little ones or the ones that you can like push the middle out with your tongue and eat strangely
it depends what they have in there
'cuz sometimes they like only have the little ones and sometimes they have the big ones
well I like the big ones that you can like ya know
aren't those so much fun
and everybody eats a certain way
and you like put your tongue through
yeah
aren't they great
thank you for the visual demonstration
you're welcome
that was cool , too bad this isn't a video
there you go
I like those occasionally they'll have Kit Kats in there
I really like Kit Kats
mmmmm , those are so good
I like to eat the top first and then I'll eat the bottom part
no I like to take the four Kit Kats and break them all into little ones and eat them like all on top of each other
I think like a lot of people do because then they came out with that like Kit Kat bar thing
ooooh yeah
and I it was like I dunno for some reason
it was like stacked Kit Kats
and for some reason that's the way I like to eat them
so you might as well just get the Kit Kat bar
yeah I I've never actually had one though
neither have I
I wonder if it's any good
I'm sure it's just as good as all the other candy is
actually I don't like Milky way 'n Snickers
snickers is good I don't really like Milky way
although do you know what is good , Snickers ice cream bars I don't like Snickers but I like the ice cream bars
those are pretty good
those are really yummy
I'm all excited about those Klondike ice cream bars
I haven't had one
those were good
should we get some
well I had thought about it last time we were at the grocery store and I looked at the nutritional information
not good
and I was like woah , that's bad I can't believe I ate six of those
but Brian you don't put any weight on
I do , it's just like not as noticeable
as when a girl puts it on
no I can do the commercial where you put the croissant on my stomach but like it's not as noticeable I have such a fast metabolism
gottcha you're a lucky I've a slow one
it's all ya know just learning to accept the way your body is
I know I know
like I mean even though I have a fast metabolism like I also eat a lot and like I just don't have the body to be you know like six pack ya know like build like ya know all like Tye you know like I just don't have the genes to do that but like in my own way I like eat what I'm happy and I'm like physically fit so
that's true
so I've just learned to start to deal with that
very cool
oh it's it's hot
is it no
it's cool it's hot
it's hot
oh yeah
it's sexy
it's gonna be hot navy black and navy whites

I'm going to have the biggest smile on my face when I'm wearing that uniform
I want a picture of that
alright
I want a picture of you without your goatee , shaved hair
I know
this is gonna be so strange
you're gonna like they could take pictures of me in college with like shaggy hair and a goatee and like piercings and like a beard and then there's going to be me like clean shave clean hair and the uniform
I know and no eyebrow ring
I know

yeah
he was really
oh
excited
yeah he loves that stuff
yeah
but yeah he knows where I keep it
uh ha ahh I see
he knows that cabinet
yeah
It doesn't matter , he's the boyfriend of one of your friends and as long as they're attached you're kind of attached to him unless you don't want to be her friend
Well , actually , last time I saw her he ditched her to go play magic with his other friends
That's
By the way , are those socks that are under that chair yours by any chance As
Oh I might have left
oh My Gosh
Because they've been there for like three weeks and I thought they were my roommate's and I looked at them today and was like "/
I bet those are Ash's
Yes
They are my socks
How the heck did you leave your socks her
I was here really late at night
You just took them off and decided to walk home barefoo
No no no no no no no
I think you had sandals that day
I think I had sandals
Since she walked over to
And and then I walked over to James' He helped you set up your computer , that's so sweet
Umm , no
the point was , we went to New York City , umm and it was okay going
like Peter and I went up and I drove my family's van
Cause there's my friend , and her boyfriend who goes to which is near nyu and our third friend who goes to NYU as well so I was like well , I've got to get Kathy and Kathy's like "/
I'm not going to go without Josh cause I promised to go home with him
and then I was like "/
as long as i'm going that way i'll go get Emily too
but I don't actually know where she lives so i told her to just meet us and take the subway instead of driving around more in nyc
it's a heck of a place to drive
it really was
I think i've learned my lesson
There's city driving , and then there's New York and LA driving
Take Septa and NJ transit , yeah
Well , it was 'cause
Are you advising her to take the subwa
Wha , make sure it's light out
Oh no , it's not New York subway
It's um
philly transit
It's very different and perfectly safe
I don't necessarily think so
It is
I mean , I've never had a problem , but
I don't know anyone else who's ever had a problem
But then again I don't think I've ever known
anyone whose had a problem in New York city , though I've known people who have had problems in Philadelphia
Oh reall
Yeah
Wher
What kind of problem
Umm
a friend of mine got mugged
Reall
Yeah
Like , on the e
Like thirtieth street statio
in thirtieth street statio
Yeah
Like , on the e
It was late
I don't know , actually now
It was a long time ago
It must have been on the el , because
that just couldn't happen In , In thirtieth street
In thirtieth street's defense , she's not necessarily the kind of person who , what's the best was to put it
she doesn't think hmm
is this a good ide
before she does something
Umm
and if someone's going to hassle her she doesn't just go eeennnhhh , they're an asshole , she's like fock you , I'm going to start a fight
Umm
Are you trying to insinuate your friend brought this on hersel
No , I'm not saying that
I'm just saying she could maybe have been
more aware of her surroundings
Or
so she doesn't have the street smarts that would posslbly
It's not that she doesn't have street smarts , it's that she chooses not to like
She's had fights with homeless people
So she actively chooses to
Whoa
Like she wanted to go take pictures at like Love Park or something
And she found this box to prop her camera up on and this homeless guy was like "/
You stole my box
And like she had a fight with this homeless guy over a cardboard box and like even if it wasn't his cardboard box , just give him the damn box
It's not worth it
Maybe she thought it was
People pick odd fights on odd things
That , that , that's
really intense
Yeah , she's an interesting person
She's a very very intense person
I like her
She's very cool
Wait , is thi
Ma
Or is this
This is somebody else
I haven't talked to her in a long time
Wow
last time I talked to her was at a party , she was like "/
You have to come to my housewarming party
And we got there at like four in the morning
And most of the people still there were on the floor passed out
Except for that we did get to the party at four in the morning and it was their housewarming party so there was like two kegs so the people who were still there at four in the morning
yeah
Don't kno
yeah
It was interesting
And you did this in NYC over spring brea
Oh no , this was a long time ago
That was in Philadelphia
No , anyway the point was , went to New York city
A bus tried to take the mirror of my van
There were two cops right there and they were like "/
yup
mmhmm Well this is NYC I think they have more important things to worry about than your
Well they were just like hanging out
They weren't anything
They're getting ready to do something
They're like cats
They're like pounce
they're like
You look like a drug dealer
Yeah
You know , or they get a murder call and they've got to jump in their car and sprint out they can't
be an extra twenty steps away trying to help some little old girl help
Well , it wasn't bad
My car didn't get hurt so that was alright then I ran two red lights cause
They come get you the
Whoa
No , actually
It wasn't 'till later that I had to talk to them
Umm
my friends are smarted
They
the directions they gave me to get to my friends apartment were like "/
Gooo till you get to Holland tunnel , come outa Holland tunnel , and you wanta go down this street towards Manhattan
I was like you know the name of that stree
No , but then you wanna keep going to you get to like this bowl , and then you'll turn right , and then you'll go down for a little while and you'll turn right again
Now Shoulda asked them for their address
Well , I did
Except they didn't tell me how to spell the names of their streets
So I wasn't able to find them because Grenwich apparently doesn't have a T in New York City
Like I called them back and was like "/
Spell your street name for me and they did and they lied to me because they don't know where they live
I think you need new friends
They do know where they live , they just
don't know where they live in relation to the rest of anything
Umm
I shouldn't have expected anything from them though
This is the person who took like threee years of knowing me and hanging out with me to be able to drive to my house without directions
Reall
Yeah
Whoa
I think this goes back to my statement that you need new friends
But that's okay , you don't get to choose your friends sometimes , you just kind of get stuck with them
Well there was no other way to get the computer , is what it came down to
Reall
Yeah
Oh , so those were the people that you were taking your computer from
Yes
So that was the entire point of
You went to NYC to get a compute
Well , and it was my friends
Oh , okay
Your friends
Your friends
Who do not know directions
A
She went to NYC to get a computer
Her friends just happened to be in the same place as the computer
lied to you
Fibbing will get you nowhere in this company
It's not a lie
It is a lie
I wouldn't have gone to NYC just to get a computer
No , I wouldn't have
Her mouth is curling at the sides
Right there
She laughed
It's a lie
She was going there to get a computer
Her friends happened to be there
I can respect that
Okay it's not like it's a bad thing
She needed the computer for various projects , school related and otherwise
She had to get it
It is a nice computer
No other way it was going to happen
She already discussed mailing , that wasn't going to happen
No , it wasn't
Anything that required my friend to make effort wasn't going to happen
Se
So it was either now or never
There nothing
don't be ashamed of the truth
How much did you pay for i
That's not bad at all
Monitor's mine
Cause she was going to give me
see , that was a whole nother thing
She was going to give me the monitor but then she was like "/
l well my mom wants to keep this one i'll get you another one from my house so we get to her house and i was like that's good , that's fine , your mom bought the computer originally
she can call the shots
they're from , like , where I live at home it was just that she

Reall
Coolio
That is exciting to me
This past
and the year before that , I was on the volunteers committee
which
which is nice , it's just , you know , it's extremely beaurocratic and
it's a big waste of time
It's a huge event these days
Sorry to change from your story
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I wanted to know something what what's this about like
cheetah hai
Wha
Wha
Oh chincilla hair
Chinchilla hair

There's a difference between cheetah and chinchilla hair
That's a
I knew that sounded wrong but I wasn't sure
So , my friend also , besides living in a den of filth , when I got there
I was like My god , I have guy friends who I thought were disgusting and you've outdone them
Umm
This is a gir
Yeah
Ooh that's nice
Yeah
It was nasty
She got a boyfrien

Well then , what do you think they ar
Acid
Why don't you read the subheading
Nitrous oxide
No
You're gonna get crazy on some nitrous , hun
If I knew it was gonna be that kind of party
Jeese
No no

Tangerine stuff
Curiously Strong
Yeah
Aren't they curiously stron
To begin with , the thing
you sort of get used to it as your mouth burns , and dies
and you salivate to no end
I'm not gonna eat any more of these
Yeah these are horrible I don't want any from them
You're suckin' them down like a crack addict
They're great
Oh , so is that what they ar
Not nitrous or acid , they're crack
That's why I like them
Okay
Nice , hmm
Smokin' that chronic , Jeese
Yeah , I guess so
I guess I don't want to think that like you know , things get sour out of boredom
I think that relationships change and that people change regardless , so
That's true
I guess sooo
You know , you really need to change your deskop background
Well what's wrong with tha
One thing at a time
It's ugly
No , ugh , oooh , it's so ugly
Why is it so
it's an open field with blue cloudy skies
It's not real
Do you know how many different kinds of clouds there are in one thing
There's not that many kinds of clouds in real life
Well there are , there're just never in the sky together
Yeah , well they're never in the sky at the same time but who care
It's still pretty to look at
Why you have to dissect it with your little scientific nonsense
I don't have scientific nonsense
You're talking about how it can't be real because the clouds never occur in it at the same time
Well she's right
It doesn't matter it's scientific nonsense
I'm a humanities major thank you very much
Baaaah
Well , actually cognitive science
Yeah well
I was gonna say
Ah yes , I don't know
It's in H_and_S_S
You're a social science , you're a quasi science , you're a wannabe science
Yeah , I'm definitely a wannabe scientist
Cause that's what all linguists are
Wannabe
scientists
Online help for mulberr
Well considering you've already had a few problems
It's not mulberry that's the problem it's Windows that should be shot
You're confident in your ability to handle mulberr
Yeah
Mulberry's so ugly what are you doin
Download SSH

No , but it's like , you know it looks like outlook express
So it's prettie
Mulberry

So and I knew a guy , and I ran into him a couple times , and I'm like "/
Dude , like I never see you down here do you like have class down here and I just never ran into yo
And he's like no
And I'm like "/
what you doin
He's like "/
Hangin out
I'm like "/
By yoursel
Outsid
Finally he admitted that he would go to this , like he had seven places he would go during the day so that he
could see this one girl , who he would never talk to
And I'm like "/
She's gonna notice at some point and be like
like he never talked to her , he never like hung out and was just like
Well it's very intimidating
sometimes
He's crazy
How do you know he's craz
He's scared of girls
No , I knew him
He was crazy
Okay
If you actually had long conversations with him that's okay I'll allow you to pass judgements upon his mental health then
Didn't we have a long conversation with this guy in the ca
Yeah
No
Well , first off what you described was not a conversation
What you described was a horrific time that you had to be subjected to
I should tell you about New York City
Since it's entertaining
Oh did you go to NY
Yes , alright
Oh yeah , I want to hear all about your break
Well , on Friday
My friend who used to have the computer
had in like september said "/
I'll sell you the computer
And I was like "/
Okay , that sounds good how am I going to get it since it's in New York City and I'm going to Pittsburgh
She's like "/
Well , I'll give it to my mom to is it oka
umm , I'll give it to my Mom and she'll bring it home when she drops me off and then you can get it like next time you come home
Which of course she didn't do
Yeah
So I was finally like Are you going to sell me the computer or no
She was like "/
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I don't know how you'll get it though cause I'm not going to carry it home on the train
That's what your boyfriend for , make him work
Her boyfriend's a cancer
Whoa
Alright , go ahead
Wait , her boyfriend
is a cance
Wha
Who needs
Uhh
I know him
I've known them both for years
I don't care , this is
it doesn't matter , go ahead
I'm sick of it , go ahead
Go ahead
You have this blatant disregard for men's feelings
it's sick
It's not men
It's her boyfriend
Well , you didn't say , you phrased it as "/
You have a boyfriend , get to be use'n 'em
like "/
You have a girlfriend , Get to beatin' 'er
Eh , that's
just the way it goes
You would hate this guy , just so you know
Alot
Well that
I I will admit that if did I actually meet these people I would be far more open to your
Like I've known him for about four years and have had one truly positive experience with him
That's rough
Yeah
That's rough
Umm
I don't
It was
We played magic cards
I actually beat him and I thought he was going to be a salty asshole but
he was actually like , I guess
Wait , is this the one
who's like , the the lump , on the gir
No no no no no no I know you were telling me this were like like , her tumor , o
Yes
This is the on
Yes
The same on
Yes
Okay
You describe this individual
as a tumo
Well , her boyfriend
That's what I was saying
Her boyfriend is a tumo
Jesus Christ , you have to call him breast cancer next time you see him
Hey cancer , how ya doin
Well it
it was originally , it was originally from someone who was like "/
Oh my god , they're always attached at the hip
So
I'm not saying it's
Yeah but I dunno So everyone likes her more than him which is why
Well
people that I'm friends with 'cause we were friends with her , were never really friends with him
That that's always
a problem when you have relationships though cause you have to find someone who your friends like too cause otherwise
Well
he never tried
Like , she would try and take him out , well she'd be like "/
I wanna go hang out with my friends instead of just your friends and he'd be like "/
I wanna come too
and then he'd sit there and he'd sulk , or be like , an asshole , or he wouldn't talk at all
Yeah
And if he did talk , he would revolve the conversation all around himself and video games , cause that's all he does
Yeah
Is this the one who was like , is is this the one
Do you understan
I can empathize
I happen to have a video game problem playing problem myself and
She was like
and from time to time if I do it for too long interacting with others can be , challenging
So
Wait wait
So what about , like , would you rather play video games or hang out with your girlfrien
She'd be like
I , Assuming
This is the one
and he'd be like Well then , yes , then
he's he's he's failing his manly duties I agree completely , I yeah
That's like , that's wrong
Now I haven't asked him for his point of view on this , I never will
it just seems like the kind of thing
oh yeah , well , we'd never want to know what he thought about the matter
No no God that wouldn't get us close to the truth at all
No no he no If I
asked him
Yeah
Like , any kind of semi okay cultivated we pretend that it's okay
Yes
would be ruined
Ah
So you would rather live in these
You think I'm mea
You thought I was nice before but now you've decided I'm mean
Yeah , I know you too well now
I , now now I've sat here for a period of many hours enjoyed many nice conversations with you and you are obviously a very mean , crass , callous individual you have
no care , no empathy for the world at large
That's not true at all
It's so true
I'm gonna get you a sticker or something
A sticke
What's it gonna sa
Umm , I love hating you
You know
Hating you makes me all warm inside , you know something like that
Something that shows she does have love and compassion in her heart
and you beat up verbally , you know
It's kind of like
When they're not there
Exactly well that's
Or or when they are there she can squeeze them , with Joy
No , no she doesn't
It's it's it's obvious passive agressive dissociation
She sits
there and she casts aspersions on these people whenever they're not around and whenever she sees them face to face what does she d
Hiiii , hi , oh
Hello
Umm
She doesn't say anything else after that and if she does there's a sharp edge to it it's kind of like giving everyone a backhand every time you talk to them
I was , I was complaining about these people too
Does that mean I'm evil too or is she just a bad influence on m
I think your soul is still
up for grabs
I have come to save it
I have come to rescue you from this charlatan over here
who will lead you into the pits of damnation
Don't worry my dear
Just trust in me
Pits , of , dam , nation
See that's what it is , I , look , she gets more play than I do for crying out loud
She does
The evil racket is better
No , she has a boyfriend
I was discussing this with a friend of mine
over the weekend
Girls like assholes better
I'm , I'm giving up
wait
Of course she gets more play than you do
She has a boyfriend
That's true
And he's many many many miles away but we're
I'm goin' with the asshole act now and given up with the good white night act I'm goin' black
Reall
Y'gonna wear a ninja sui
Gonna start
slappin' and pimpin' out women
start bein' mean , and ornery
I don't
like , I'm dating a nice guy
He's obviously not nice then
No
I
he is , he helped her set up her computer
Oh come on
Then you'll scar his heart and leave him within a year
Will not
You will
Will not
Will
You'll find some mean guy you think is sexier and more exciting
That's what it is
It's the grass is always greener than the other side
It drives the weak to
I think you're just repeating age old
I think I'm bitter
I think I'm horribly bitter
I think you're bitter too
I know
I think you should grow out your beard and then you would be less bitter
Wh
Then I'd look like a big amish man
Well that's what my boyfriend is like and I like it
Just because you like guys with beards
are cute doesn't mean that most people do
I love
guys with beard
Do yo
Oh my gosh
See I , I have an overabundance of testosterone I assume 'cause I grow facial hair like no man's business
And
so so you should just let it grow
Well I , I cannot , my father looks like Ted Kazinsky
when he first came out of that little shack in the woods , I mean , he's
like Blaow , Grisley Adam's in the house
Whoah , that guy has some beard
And , I'd be down with that look , but , I think it would make me look older than I already do
look and I look kind of elderly now
I haven't been carded for anything in quite some time and that's kind of cool at first but then it sucks
well you should shave
Yeah but if I shaved then I would have to shave these areas these areas are the most difficult to shave right here because they have the most curves
And I have to shave on a constant basis like every other day
if I want to look anywhere near okay , every third day I can get away with
But I have to shave a lot , awesome
And if I have
don't patronize me
no no no no it's really interesting , like
Some people don't have to shave at all some guys don't have to shave at all
Aww they , they for whatever reason , they can get away with shavin' once a week , twice a week with some of 'em and even if they don't go for a long time all they get is this little porn mustache like right
over their lip and around here
porn mustach
yeah it's a porn mustache ever see a porn mustach
No , it's like a very thin little mustache
you know you're traumatizing me
stop it , alright I won't
talk about porn mustaches anymore
Well , my friend's a stripper
that's
cool
I don't know
I was actually upset about it
reall
it was only I was upset about it because she didn't tell me
She told Peter and she told Peter not to tell me , yeah
And that hurt my feelings , ohhh
She told
well it's probably just because she's embarressed or something
I know probably it it's because she didn't want me to like be
mean to her or talk about i
But , do you have a view that there's something wrong with strippin
no
I don't , and that's why like my feelings are kind of hurt
because it's like , she thought that you had a view that you don't have , yeah
and I'm are you a , forgive me
if are you a feminis
do you consider yourself a feminis
yes , well it's like it means that people could women can do whatever they want
I'm not saying I'm not saying that like it's a choice I would make for myself
no no no no no no
but I'm okay with it like I know people
but whowever makes that choice
But you're not going to cast aspersion on them
no , I don't
think she's like
but there are some
there are some feminists out there that believe that that should be illegal that you should not be allowed to do that same thing with pornography
you know I see I mean I see that perspective I'm not
you don't agree
with it though
I don't know
like it's I think it's a very
I mean , it's not the best choice in the world but working at McDonald's isn't the best choice in the world either and it doesn't mean
we'd make it illegal
Yeah , Umm , I mean , I know she makes good money
I know that she feels very safe
Umm like and those things are good , I'm glad of that , yeah
Umm , so I was trying to draw it into the abstract as in what you know stripping in general means to you but cause you know whenever you talk about you know my friend is doing it
well you have a lot more of a tendency towards acceptance
if your friends
doing it as opposed to some stranger somebody you don't know 'cause you personalize it
Honestly , like , I it doesn't , stripping doesn't bother me I think it would be like I'm now a porn star
What's wrong with tha
like , I don't know that would weird me out a little bit
wh
Ehhh , I don't
Maybe it's because it implies , it implies
see you believe something and you don't know why
Maybe because it implies like you're , you're actively , doesn't porn
imply , well , I guess you could just be like a model or
well yeah
or something
you could do that , but that's not , I mean
let's talk serious porn here hard core porn
I'm having sexy on television
Well not television but tv and it's recorded
Yeah but I think it maybe that's just because you know we have such a generalized association with that that's just you know , so
negative , you know
but it
shouldn't be
it's like , I don't know
well if here , I think what it is
if you like
the attention and
you know it makes you happy it's like you know more power to you
I wanna see some
I don't know
It's that like a lot of porn is so so bad
Like , in so many ways
you know
like wha
like , I mean
feel free to , well , you know bail on this if you don't want to go into specifics but what do you find so
I like just think that it misrepresents sexuality
course it
and gender it does
Course it does
anyone who , no , who watches pron to get any sort of idea as to what sexuality gender and healthy relationships is I mean , that's why people don't
want children to see it , it's because they want children to develop , like , maybe semi
realistic ideas of like men and women themselves , the rest of the world
That's why you can't , you know , get porn until you're eighteen , twenty one
Or , when you're eleven , because you now have a family computer
Well , well but that that's a problem obviously and there are ways to solve that
that's what it is , and like if I knew somebody that was like I don't know that would make me uncomfortable
because of that
like if you and your boyfriend or whatever wanna go because you think little kids would see i
no
But because I just think that it's , I think that people in general are very irresponsible , and , like , don't think , so
I mean , I would feel like I I knew somebody that was you're contributing to a problem then namely the fact that children are
no , not it's not about
children it's about people in general , like
I mean , 'cause these are so far out there and
so screwed up umm eh , the that they create
the ideas in people which are unrealistic , yeah , yeah
and I think that , people
really do see that and think that that's normal or okay or whatever and I don't think it is and that's what would make me uncomfortable
I mean a fantasy is fantasy and that's fine
but when , like , I don't know
Yeah and when fantasy crosses over into reality people can't separate the two
there's something very wrong with that , yes
Okay , so that's the job of a psychologist
I guess , the one thing that I really like about porn , is encryption technology
that's arisen because of it
and , that makes me happy
Yeah , continue
I was going to say
that I um a have heard similar arguments
to say that you know roleplaying
is , is is wrong and
and there's something icky , and not acceptable about it
on those same basis because
ata point in time a
person cannot
distinguish between
reality and pretend
I'm not saying
that this is anything that you can regulate
or should necessarily be regulated I'm just saying that
Yeah , it's a problem , and it is
a problem that
stretches into areas
bigger than pornography
I mean I think it's a
general problem with
individuals on a
psychological level like
Ash said , that is
causing the problem and if you really wanta
treat what the problem is
treat that because
because because if it isn't the pornography
if it isn't the roleplaying
they're going to see something else
it's gonna be on the tv it's gonna be them walking down the street
Well I'm certainly with these arguments , I guess
that it would make me uncomfortable to know someone who felt that those things were okay
Yeah , or would say , I
make a lot of
money like that wouldn't make me , well
yeah well if they uncomfortable
The other thing is though that I
I have to hope that
the people who
think it's a problem
are not going to buy it and enough
people will have the general
intellect
to not support it
and not buy it
and then you won't have
problems with
people having buy
in and regulate and things like that
cause it'll just disappear it'll
But I mean , it never will
Well that's because there's a segment of the population that wants it
and likes it , and unless you're willing to accept
a paternalistic
viewpoint that's saying "/
I know what's best for you
I don't know , I think
I'm going to tell you what's best for you
it's always gonna exist it's gonna be
there , In that case
I think the cure is worse than
the disease , mainly
you know , big
johnny government
telling you no no no you can't
watch that , cause it I
think it's bad
for you , it's like smoking and drinking
and drug use and all the other nonsense
I mean , do think you're right , I think
do think it's
problem , umm , like , my friend
who's a stripper , she does she usually
works the day
Like she hardly ever works at night
Umm , she has like
regular customers
Yeah
Like , who , at least from what
she said , and that
I've heard from
and from like reading things about the sex business
in general , not just stripping
is that they just want
sombody to talk to
Yeah
and it's like
What is
wrong with our society
if like you're hiring like a
prostitute or an escort
or you're going to the strip joint
because you have no one to talk to
or you have a family but you don't feel like you can talk to them
like we have a much bigger problem
than somebody's boobs
getting shaken around for money
Well , yeah
and that's true , and unfortunately
pornography is an outlet for a lot of
social problems , and
and individual problems
that are not addressed in a more productive and creative way
it's , it's a nasty patch job
it's kind of like using you know alcohol
or any other drug to self medicate
yourself , you know it's not , there's
problem there you need to
address and the drug use
is just something you're trying to do
to make up for it
if you want to really get at the drug use
treate what's creating the
person or causing the person
to use drugs in the first place
that'll get you a heck of a lot
better of a result
But we as a society don't care
Well , like we don't
It's cheaper
It's cheapter to prevent
It's not even cheaper
it's like
cheapter to prevent to to it's cheaper
and easier
to deal with the symptoms than it is
with the actual problems
because if you deal with the actual problems
you would need a
level of
governmental control
that people would find
unacceptable in some
I
I don't think that's
even necessarily that I think it's looking out for someone who's not you
that people in our society aren't willing to do
Well but , I mean I can see that if
if you want to accept that society's selfish
and kind of self centered on
me me me then yeah
I I think it's
it's more
apt to say that
people don't have
people , you
have to be willing to say You need help
You need help you need help and who's going to be that one
person who decides who needs help
and who doesn't
It's real easy in a lot of cases
when you come to
problems like homelessness
or poverty
Yeah
obviously it needs some help
but when you get into the fundamental
issues like
you know , free choice
you know , privacy
when you get into those issues
it's much harder
to say that I know
what's best for you
and I can
think up ways
to help you , and
I'm going to
kind of impose them on you
because maybe somebody
doesn't want to be helped
at what point in time does the
individual have the right to say Piss off
on you society , I don't care
what you think is
best for me , I want to
sit here and destroy myself
to me
I mean we I think it's very obvious
that there is a line somewhere
Yeah
Maybe it's not very easy to
choose , but I think we can look
around at all level and all
Yeah
There are some serious problems
Every
one will accept that but no one will select accept responsibility or a solution
No one wants to pay for it and no one wants to say I think that's right
They'd rather just dance around
Apathy
Apathy , take away , placate a man's pleasures
and you can take away his free will
So what do you want to do for food eat
I'm starving
You didn't want cookie
My my my
if I ever wish to attract a member of the opposite sex
Jamming cookies down my gullet
is not the way to do it
Although the two fo you are lucky enough not to have this problem
As you have ensnared two young men
I still have not
So I must be
I don't know , my my boyfriend has a
Little gu
Yeah
Yeah my boyfriend
says I made him fat , I think that's
because he was angry
No
No , no cause he has a girlfriend
Now why does hell does need to keep lookin' goo
Well
Well to keep the girlfriend
He's like I got , I
Are you saying that we'll never leave them once we
What
I'm saying that if you leave him it will most likely not be because he is fat and ugly
because my exposure to females leads me to believe
that if he is there for you emotionally
then you are willing to overlook other such problems
now let us reverse the tables
and put you in the fat chair
and him in the non fat chair
A man , will go She got
Fat , I need to move out , I need to trade up
We are a much more physically based sex
See , I
I mean I I think men are definitely more visual but I do
I could name a multiple couples that I have known
where one or the other party has put on a significant amount of weight
and the other party has not cared
No
because that is called love
and if you can look through the false facade
to the truly beautiful individual beneath that
then you can find something very important
What is that face fo
That was the most beautiful conversation
Yeah and notice how the one havin' it is single
Speaking of which
Y'all should put some shoes on
because I wanna take both of you out , and then you
can like fight over me in public
and then I can like pick up a third woman and
leave with her
and that'll make her really hot and everything
and then you guys can get a meal out of it
Come on
Help me out here
Coo
You can have a cat fight with each other
Okay
My , my
I I would so have a cat fight we can stage a cat fight
Yeah , se
Definitely
If we can like stage
That's not going to attract a woman
Yes it , the one the kind I'm looking for
it will cause she'll be turn around and go oooh
no
fighting over that well dressed man over there
Do you
really want a girl like tha
I don't know , like
I didn't say I wanted , I want a meaningless sexual encounter
at this stage of the game I'm not lookin for
oh okay
a home run I just wanna get to first base
oh nice nice music this morning by the way
yeah ivy was pissed about
ivy doesn't like that music
it's not that i don't like it i just don't like waking up to stuff like that
i got that for him i had to go all the way to iceland for it

i've heard of coram mike
and the gates are locked after nine thirty
the bagel paradise mike wor lives in coram

yeah wednesday night i guess
and it was ten o'clock
i was thinking of going but i have too much to do
you should go eventually

cause i'd like a vacation from this chaos and fucking coldness
yeah
we always get frustrated cause like about about i dunno november we get a flood of R_Vs snowbirds just like coming down in droves
there's uh a family guy episode that dad would like where like all these new yorkers go to rhode island to see the leaves change in autum

that's like our freezing winter
they did that to us at school this dan went no you didn't did you go to disney world
yeah

the worst when brother tom
yeah
having a seance
yeah
um train is the one mom said it was
right

just wave the door around
it's not ours
no it's not the one in the hallway is it
it's yours
mine
the point is is mom gonna come and wake me up at eight

this
thank you so much for letting us stay
oh you're welcome
thank you so much for the uh extra money that you had to throw out

food things they don't tell us about
alright i gotta get out of here dan be good travel home safely
mk
and i'll see you soon as we
a quarter of the volume it should be

you have some information about that week in may
yeah i have to figure out the finals
you have a battery for that
it's still recording
yeah it is
are you gonna show this to your teacher
i'm gonna take the best ten minutes i can find
ok
the best five minutes really
i have to transcribe and
in the uh the midterms they do a lot of the rush stuff for the sororities and fraternities
where's my penguin
and so like the like great thing is to like go and pull the fire alarm at four thirty in the morning when everyone has midterms and finals so retarted
see i'm gonna try to figure out if um talking about star wars or fire alarms going off is better to transcribe
star wars
i think he's gonna be like what is wrong with this kid
what is wrong with this kid and his friends oh my god they're insane
actually i think the best ten minutes would be your mom coming inside and you going i have swords and she goes yeah and i know how to use them too
was it recording then
i think so
no cause i recorded it when chris came in
when chris came in
he didn't come in til your mom left

no the smoke out here isn't all me this is like the kitchen
there is no smoke
yes there is
it's just going off
well just leave the battery out
i know but no it's like a quarter of the volume it should be listen
i know it's a quarter volume
i see

i know well just chill alright

yes it was but
that was just the way he sounded i have clothes in there dan
have you seen him ever no one's heard or
he's at kellenburg
he changed his cell phone number
he's coming to chaminade next year he probably doesn't have a cell phone the brothers probably took it away
he uses the chaminade cellular phone
yo this guy
do you have the chaminade cell phone number
no
chaminade brothers own like one collective cell phone
Yeah , but I thought we set this up the first time when
Oh well , whatever
setenv
set environment Cvsroot to tilde Sunya private cvs
cvs root tilde
mmm hmm
Sunya
Sunya
private
private cvs
Okay , and then set then /
Definitely set Pg_Data and set /
You have Pg_Data /
you should have Pg_Data set righ
pgdata
sigh
To which on
to where ever I want it
yeah
and then
and then set environment path
this I definitely know
the pat
yeah
to the
yeah , okay
that's fine , okay
um , x , no I didn't touch anything
well the only thing that looks different is the source stuff
Uh , okay
um , sorry I was talking to my computer
So more importantly when are we going to go ea
who cares about wor
Yeah , I know really righ
Laugh
when are we going to go eat um
augh
I'm so burned out I was going to go to the librarary right
to do the check out thing
uh huh
with the books , whatever
oh my god
Are you seriou
yeah
I
But I think I'm making up for sleep that I've lost over for the three days I didn't sleep
yeah definitely
which kinda still makes me really angry cause there was no point in studying
I know
That whole database thing , augh , I don't even want to talk about it
I like , I called my mom and I was like , I think I just flunked databases and my mom was just like oh
She was probably like yeah , whatever Belinda , Its the same thing
wait , why does it say tha
c v s
Uh , did you /
exit out and relog in
mm hmm , good point
um
yeah and then I was like
I called my daddy
Are you seriou
I
He's always the person I call when it comes to
laugh
cs or exams or whatever
Yeah , I was , I dunno
that wasn't a very fair exam by any means and
The first part was fair I thought
yeah
I was like , oh chugging along fine
I mean , the first part could have been harder if he really wanted to , you kno
But like the second part was just ridiculous
and I didn't know , okay , it was hard for me to guesstimate it I was taking too long compared to other people
Yeah , cos like it didnt , ooh I dunno
because that's why I didn't say anything right after the exam when when like Sunya was like how did you do and I was like I dunno
I figured maybe like my part that was like spending too much
no
time on the first three questions
no
and I was trying to hurry myself up through the class
Like the minute I put down my pen I was like I flunked
laugh
I flunked , that's it
I When he like called like twenty something minutes I was like
Did he call twenty something minute
He did call
He didn't call five minutes at all
I was just like , all of a sudden he's like okay time's up and I was like wha
he didnt call anything but on the board
He just wrote stuff on the board , yeah
I think when I finally looked up when he did the twenty something minutes left or whatever and I was like uh , I'm still working on my btree
oh
and this is only problem number three , was i
yeah , I got through that part pretty fast
cos I hurried through
Like I got through that I got through most of that by forty
until there were like thirty five minutes left and I was working on the rest
oh okay
So you would have had any more /
It wouldn't have mattered
Heh because an extra ten minutes on the last two questions didn't matter
yeah
When he said that you know , I was like oh shoot what else do I have left to do you know and then I looked at the point like like how much points were each section , like on the last three questions , one was
mm hmm
one was like okay , a total of like six points
and then the other one was twelve points each
twelve points
yeah
okay , I guess that's
i was like that's gone
that's thirty points right there
and it wasn't out of a hundred either , it was out of eighty or something
Are you seriou
I don't remember if it was out of a hundred
I dunno
I don't remember
I didn't really look though
yeah I didn't either
oh gosh
that's okay
Okay , I gotta
A little bit of swipe swipe action and I'll be good today
swipe swipe action
That's so bad
I'm going to have to swipe my lunch I have no cash
laugh
okay , I'm good I checked it out
okay
configure
dash dash , prefix pound home dollar sign home
like really type tha
yeah
I guess it is
yup
because you you should have a home defined
yup
yeah
Configure not found
Okay I don't have configure
Are you in the the project three slash source durector
No
You have to switch to project three acutally
you have to be in the right directory or you can't do the dot slash dude
Yeah change into project three there , yes
Yeah se
Whatever
Sunya was really good about directions actually
He is
Except for the one part where you get to gmake you have to do gmake clean first
ok
I discovered that beacause it wouldn't work otherwise
Oh I have two errors , is that fin
That's fine , whatever
It always gives you errors dude
run gmake install
hmmm
wow its
Its lovely how you see ooh , missing prototypes , missing prototypes
Heh , I don't even look at that
Missing declarations great
Do you have enough quot
I don't know , we'll find out
Heh , did you remove homework thre
oh wait , you didn't set up homework three
eighty five
I have seventy seven
i have a lower grade
Aren't we excite
you wha
Sorry , just babbling
Repository , hu
yeah
So turning on and off the thing doesn't really wor
is that what it wa
Turning on and off works no it works , it just doesn't totally work
It um , what we think , what i think , is going on is somehow you know when you do the explain select thin
You're supposed to get um it's supposed to call our unique hash and our unique has sort whatever right
mm hmm
It apparently seems like our distinct x one is working , just our normal one isn't
Which is really weird because I would have thought it would have been the other way around if it was going to do it that way
I don't know if its an error cause Sunya was like it might be an error it might not be an error so we're going to have to go back and look at that at some point
probably not now because probably
Okay , so I guess , in a sense , we could go back and try to fix it but then we might be wasting time
Right
I thnk right now we're wasting time so right now we need to go
better off
talking about in memory
Right so I said I will go back and look at it later like over break and you can we can today we will focus on
one is the inmemory hashing
inmemory hashing and hybrid hashing
and we should poke some files as to see maybe where where we can use what and
right
where we would implement it and where would we just yeah
right
Sigh , we don't have the time to deal with this
this is retarded
I told David I was like you know its really unfair for you guys to have homework due you know , basically give us only a week and he was like well
technically you guys had that week that first week because that overlap with homework homework two
two
He was like yeah homework two wasn't hard bla bla bla bla bla and i didn't even say anything
Yeah but you know wha
I was just so pissed
I was like shut up
Everyone had two weeks of midterms
yeah
It was spaced over two weeks
and like maybe I didn't have a midterm , but I had papers to write
something
because remember that week when I came into Wean and we did the homework tw
I was still pretty dead because I didnt sleep and that hurt me
I pulled about four near all nighters
right
It's not a big deal beacuse whatever
yeah
but still
but he was just like you guys were supposed to work on it the first week and I was like
I was like if i didn't have an exam in a week or in a day I would argue this but
Is Kelly gon
Yeah , she left already for break
She left yesterday
I dunno
I came back after that test and she was gone already so
Nice
Yeah
Heheh , I want a real break
sigh senior year
laugh
Yeah the things is when I was talking because Sunya come over
uh huh
to eat ice cream , remembe
and I kinda like
right right
and Ben was there and we talked
Right after class and what happened was I told Sunya I want to help out and pull my weight through
right
I felt bad about going to the interview stuff its like ill timed again
right
I think interview stuff shuld supercede school right
and instructors should kind of accomodate for that
Crystal said she got extensions on her projects with her team beacaus eshe had to be out of town
you know for a couple of days
you really think Olstons going to give us an extension
no
0
Exactly , he'd be like you had four weeks to do it
but yeah it ended up being like a conversation Sunya was like I don't know if Ben has a computer
he was like Ben do you have a computer and he was like yeah
what kind of connectio
fifty six k
and then Sunya was like maybe you can just work on in memory hahsing
and assume that's just your chunk and if you can get that done or mostly working then belinda and I can come back and hack in memory
the hybrid hashing
hybrid
yeah the whatever whatever
right
that didn't help , but I was kinda like then later in retrospect because Ben came up to me later after Sunya came up and was like well I didn't realize you had that much work
You know how Ben is
he doesn't say anything
yeah
so like
He's always like disappointed but like
He wouldn't even say that if it didn't bother him
right right
It must have bothered , irked him enough to say something to the effect of mentioning it , but not saying
he wasn't like oh you have work
right
It was just like I didn't realize you had this much work righ
so that's like very passive agressive
yeah
and i was like hmm
the other thing is yeah i did spend two hundred dollars like I was paying to go down
to go down to Austin , righ
Yeah I didn't mind whatever
you know I don't shirk off work
I work hard and stuff like that you know i think that people should do like equal
Just ended up being a bad situation
yeah
and then taking to my mom later that evening cause my dad
was like you have to make sure whatever you get done , you get done , you have made a commitment to the group
I was like dad I should just drop the class
okay fine if it doesn't kill your gpa
I was like
but then I'll screw my members over
he was like ooh , whatever , don't talk to me about this
you decide , you kno
heh
but then I talked to my mom since I haven't seen her in a while
right
She lives out in Cali
She was the one who reminded me of the whole , you're going over as a guest , you've been invited
right
by his parents
I'm not sure how this is but I remember when me and my Ben we had this planned oh we want to do like hotpot and we
wanted to like take him out
right
take him around and all this stuff and take him to places and restuarants and whatever
The expectation is that spring break you have no work so of course you can go out and do things you kno
yeah
and
but it's just the expectation that i'm going to be there as a guest
right
because you like come home and my parents are pretty like you're home to spend some time so they kinda get irked if I just lock myself in a room
right
but they're more understanding about it
right
but if came over and accepted an invitation as a guest
my mom reminded me that being a guest and she said maybe its like more of an asian thing
but she thought that
it probably is
but I
but no it makes sense
but Zack because I was talking to him about like how would you feel if someone was invited to dadi di di you know
right
and they did work
not in like constantly work but like
right but you wouldn't feel
I would borrow your computer and work and work a good chunk you know
right
yeah he was like I think that would be really rude
obviously it just especially if they're planning thiings for you and you have to be like yeah
yeah
beacuse they've been like kinda like oh do you want to go to the symphony they know I appreciate music
uh huh
How about this cooking clas
it's all Thai and vegetarian stuff
They're really going out of their way to accomodate for me
right
Not accomodate accomodate , but look for things I might be interested in
yeah
because Ben told them she doesn't eat meat but she eats fish or whatever
mm hmm
and his father makes like really awesome food
oh that's cool
so he's been planning dad you have to make your didiidi fish and this and make this dish and this kinda thing
aww , that's awesome
so its going to be really fun but then
aww , that's swwet
yeah and then I told my mom about these conversations
had with Ben and whatever
yeah
and she reminded me of that
right
its just like shoot
yeah , and I wish I didn't say so quickly and make Sunya like kinda
like rely on you
Sunya will always say the right things like of course i don't want you to work and he knows
right
when he's on a road trip he can't work
right
so its not fair to expect everyone to work
right
when he's not that kinda thing whatever
but yeah I didn't want to seem like I didn't want to put in my share of work or whatever
well I think Sunya knew that you're not like
Right , but I just like that conversation was like wait , i kinda inadvertandtly committed without thinking stuff
mmm hmm
Like that
the conversation after class was more like to clarify that its better to expect that i'm not going to work on it
Right , obviously
and work really hard when I come back
You and I had no expectation since we didn't have that conversation
yeah that's true
but the West Wing conversation was something like that
right
to the discussion yesterday
So , as long as we're all on the same page and we know we're going to have to work hard or we know that it's a stupid project
Oh i know , gosh
Eh , whatever
My schedule
Yeah , what happene
get's more and more ridiculous
I dropped a class
But , but I have another class after that xey block
Mmm hmm
I have another class
Oh ok I was like , that doesn't make sense
You have
you have , like no class at uh no class at all now huh
I have more free time than class
Mmm hmmm
Yeah I had to drop that class

As well
There's no way I can
I mean

I'm sorry
That's so bad
That's so sad
Yay
Yeah I'll be here
That will be really good
Although
If you do move into like a place next year

Yeah , but anyway we'll figure that later
Oh kay
That'll be good
What are you doing over the summer dud

I want to get this internship

You can come visit
I know I want to take classes
I'm probably going to have to take a class
Mmm hmmm
I don't know if i'm going to do it here or not
Try to find classes in new york
Oh that's true
Where the hell am I going to do I have to find a place
Mmmm like hmmmmm
Well I have I I have a uh family in Scarsdale I could probably
Hello , that's not New York City
I know
Isn't there a train thoug
Oh i'm sure there is
Damn that would be really cool though
I'm gonna , I'm trying to think , yeah
Who in my friends like I can contact
That would be good apartment
Cause apartments right now even though in New York City its real still expensive
Mmm hmm
It's lesser than condos
Cause everyone wants condos like everyone is investing , buying , selling condos
Condos
And apartments are being left behind
So
It would be really sweet cuz that what I'm hoping for like when I graduate that the rates are still low
I'll like get an apartment somewhere it'd be so hot
damn dude isn't housing expensive in the city thoug
It is , It is
But you could always get one in Brooklyn and in Queens
And walk over
Yeah Cause uhm like Queens to New York I mean city they're alkl like well depending on where you wanna go but about twenty five thirty minutes
Train ride
oh , yeah
it's really simple though because you get confused with everyone screaming at you in the subway
sorry bad bad image
Mmmmmm
it's alot of fun
Yes
No its a lot of fun oh
I bet it is
And then like if you find a roomate It'll be really fun If eric wants to study
of course he wants to
there's like uhm you know the photography uhm institute there and he can take classes and we could all be together
that's true
fantastic
wow dude
Sorry I'm getting all excited
Wow
Ok i'm gonna change
it's a lot of fun
yeah , sounds like it
muy bien , ánimo
gracias senor
ah están los rayados hasta por el celular , están enojados , dice que de los
nueve refuerzos de los tigres , siete van a jugar el sábado , para
que tomemos en cuenta
Raul Lopez Castillo , que si va a jugar Claudio Núñe
No va a jugar Claudio Núñez
José Alfredo Villanueva Reyes dice que nosotros los tigres no estamos preocupados que los que se preocupan son los rayados ya que están pendientes de quién se va y quién viene
Christian de la colonia del valle que necesita hablar con don Roberto al aire que por favor se comunique con él ya que ayer también le pidio que le hablara y no le habló , le hablo en este momento
con mucho gusto , espero que esté desocupado el teléfono
para poder tener el honor de platicar con él
si es de la colonia del valle , evidentemente es rayado
bueno , buen
que tal don Roberto
quién habl
Christian
hola Christian
que tal
a las órdenes
aver , tu dices que los tigres estan incompleto
yo no digo
lo están
es cuestión nadamente de palomear
ok yo te voy a decir una cosa
para empezar , ellos van a salir con once jugadores
ayer tu lo dijiste , son once contra once , es uno contra uno , que el bongo bongo no es lo mismo que el otro chavo de barcel
entonces eso es cierto
pero yo te voy a decir una cosa
los tigres no son siete u ocho jugadores
los tigres son un plantel de veinticinco
y cuando yo veo una foto del plantel de tigres
yo no veo miembros de tigres A , miembros de tigres B
miembros de tigres C
Tigres son veinticinco jugadores
jueguen los que jueguen
a menos de que tengas que subir gente de divisiones inferiores
son lo mismo
mientras tu pongas esos once , estan completos
si tu tienes once para jugar en la cancha y siete para banca , tigres va a estar completo
cuando usted en el caso del equipo de Monterrey
mueve , solamente uno , caso por ejemplo y no le voy a decir el centro delantero Denigris porque sería mucha ventaja de mi parte
cuando usted mueve al lateral izquierdo
mete a Chabrand y quita al otro jugador cambia todo , eh
es cierto que cambia todo
nadamas con uno
con uno que yo mueva
osea
pero le debo decir sabe que , que por eso debe de el Monterrey o el tigres o el equipo que sea
tener gente para suplir , deben entrenar para esas situaciones
yo estoy de acuerdo
tigres sabe que si sus seleccionados , no se , bueno se van , deben de tener entrenada gente para suplirlo
yo estoy de acuerdo
que si te expulsaron al portero , pues que debes de tener otro
estoy de acuerdo
que si esta lesionado el diablo , entonces que le iba a decir
nadamas que
son once contra once
una cosa es sustituir
a uno , y otra cosa es sustituir siete
si usted va a sustituir un defensa central , y sigue usted contando con Claudio Suárez
no hay ningún problema
pero si se le va Claudio Suárez y se le va Hurtado
y tiene usted que meter dos novatos ahi , ya pesa
le voy a decir una , vea usted al Guadalajara , le quitan al pirata y le quitan a Claudio y ve usted al mismo jugador que se veía muy bien ahora andar completamente mal
entonces el Guadalajara tiene la obligación de contratar a alguien que lo pueda suplir
claro
y si no lo hace , ese ya es problema del Guadalajara
claro
va a pagar el respectivo precio que es como lo esta pagando ahorita
si tigres no tiene calidad para sustituir un centro delantero con otro centro delantero del mismo nivel , no de la misma caracteristica porque no es igual
evidentemente va a pagar un precio
yo veo desde ahorita que el tigres esta expuesto a pagar el precio en el clásico
no se enojen por ello
asi es , pero sabe que , no no le quite desde ahorita mérito a un posible triunfo del Monterrey
no le estoy quitando mérito , estoy diciendo simplemente eso , vamos a suponer
ah , como les digo ya , Chihuahua
es que ustedes se enojan luego luego
piensan que yo estoy demeritando un probable triunfo de Monterrey , no es así
entonces no saque tantas , tantos pretextos
no es pretexto
son pretextos , son pretextos
es simplemente una , una objetividad en cuanto a ver al equipo de tigres , casi casi le diria a usted que no es
usted puede contar que el equipo de tigres tenga la misma proyección ofensiva
no quiero mencionar nombres porque voy a herir ahi a algunos jugadores
de alguna manera
Tuca Ferreti lo sabe
si
y evidentemente ahorita en este momento esta con mil problemas para armar el partido del , del proximo sábado
si
que no es un partido común y corriente , usted sabe lo que se pierde cuando se pierde un clásico
si si si
pero si usted me dice a mí cuál esta más cerca de ganar pues está
está más cerca Monterrey toda la vida , eso no quiere demeritarlo
pero aun así , todo lo que se está diciendo de que están debiluchos , que no hay central
bueno
sera cierto , pero
como quiera sigue siendo tigres y ganarle a ese equipo o ganarle al otro va a ser a final de cuentas lo mismo
ayer le hice una pregunta al público y nadie me la contestó , le pido a usted que me la conteste , si al Monterrey le quitamos a Denigris qué pas
qué pas
el Monterrey , a lo mejor se debilitaría , pero sigue siendo el Monterrey , son circunstancias que pasan en el futbol
pero evidentemente no va a encontrar la misma cantidad de goles o la misma facilidad para meter el gol
a lo mejor
mire usted
pero Monterrey debe
mire usted la cantidad de goles cuantos lleva Denigris y cuantos lleva el resto del plantel y como dice Benito Floro
Monterrey debe estar preparado para que le quiten a Denigris
como dice Benito Floro en el periódico el día de ayer en el diario de Monterrey dice nosotros dependemos de Denigris , nuestra ofensiva está clavada en Denigris
asi es
entonces eso es un problema del Monterrey
claro
no debemos de depender así
tigres tiene un problema al estar dependiendo
lo que pasa es
es que para que encuentres a otro Denigris esta cañón , tienes
que jugar con él , un día se te va a lesionar bueno , pues ya veremos como , como se hace pero evidentemente prepárense porque ese día , el Toluca sin cardozo , el partido pasado , fue otro cu , otro Toluca
la delantera no funcionó
si
porque hay jugadores claves , en posiciones claves , no son once contra once como ustedes dicen , eh
si asi es , que le iba a decir , son , al decir que son once contra once quiere decir que estan completos en cuanto a números
ya si los , si los equipos no tienen gente para suplir a sus , a sus importantes , entonces sabes que ahí es un problema
claro
uno debe de tener cuando menos uno
o cuando menos dos , y si no los tiene , uno debe de preveer , bueno que va a pasar cuando me falte este jugador
debo de entrenarlo para que el que venga
claro
y que está atrás , aunque no tenga la misma calidad , clave en ese sistema
usted me puso el ejemplo del Toluca
el Toluca quitas uno , quitas otro y no varia mucho
el Toluca esta listo para jugar con quien sea , y como sea
y si tigres no esta listo , tigres o Monterrey o el Guadalajara o el que sea no esta listo para cuando se les van jugadores así
o se lastima uno , o le suspenden uno , para jugar de otra manera , sabes que eso es un problema de tigres
así como es un problema cuando a los que salen titulares , que son titulares
le voy a poner
le voy a poner a usted otro ejemplo de ver lo lo lo lo lo confuso que es el deporte del futbol , lo diferente , lo difícil que es el deporte del futbol
cuando el Monterrey tuvo aquel equipo de Ledezma , de Guarací , Cano , este , el halcón , Ricardo Díaz , Juan González todo eso
si usted ve la alineación y se la platican
hay una estrella en cada posición y el suplente es igualmente una estrella
si le faltaba Corbo entraba Damián , si le faltaba Jiménez entraba Milton , o
viceversa , si faltaba Nilo entraba Avilán , el gorras Guerrero , puro
jugador estelar
si
y que pas
se hicieron bolas a la hora de la hora , empezaron los eh los los golpes por abajo , que
yo quiero jugar , que yo no quiero banca , tan problema es que tengas demasiado estelar como problema es que no tengas sustitutos para ser estelar
lo que yo le cuento a ustedes es que tigres no tiene , el total de los sustitutos como para adaptarlo en en cuatro o cinco días de entrenamiento
entonces deben de adaptarlos desde antes , porqué hasta ahorit
ah porque hasta ahorita surge el problema
pos ese es problema de tigres que se pongan a preveer las situaciones que se puedan dar
claro que es problema de tigres
si
evidentemente , yo no digo que el Monterrey tenga nada que ver , ustedes son los que dicen que yo estoy demeritando algo que puede pasar
a lo mejor no lo está haciendo pero esta poniendo énfasis en ese punto
o a lo mejor se fijan ustedes demasiado
no pero lo está haciendo es lo único de lo que hemos hablado toda la semana , practicamente
es que es la noticia más importante
no , la noticia más importante es el clásico , no que si tigres trae
ya esta
ese ya esta , el clásico va a jugar , el lleno ya esta asegurado
si
la gente ya esta adentro , que falt
pues analizar a los planteles
y los planteles me dicen a mí , por lo menos a mí , que tienen ese ese ese problema
le parece bie
pues , nadamas espero que si llega a ganar Monterrey que no le quite méritos y que si llega a ganar tigres no diga que mira que con plantelito chiquito tigres es tigres jueguen los que jueguen
hecho señor
igual el Monterrey , igual el Guadalajara
le agradezco , Christian
muchas gracias
orale
está enojado , está enojado , están enojados
todo mundo está enojado
oye parece ser que levantamos algo que arde en serio
vamos a continuar
oye ponme un futbolito para que nos relajemos un poquito
y una pausa comercial y retornamos
It's fun , I never used to have them until I came to CMU I really didn't
That's nice
A little
A littl
Yeah
No , you , I don't think you have any sort of speech impediment
Ummm actually , I , umm , tend to take on aspects of all different speech impediments
I see
I disbelieve you
Moslty by slurring my words
Or slurring aspects of my words
I'm not sure you do that any more than usual for other people , though
As opposed to when I'm talking to mysel
No , I'm not talking about you
when I'm talking about myself
Talking
Have you been following me araoun
You bastard
I don't think I've been following you around
I think I would have noticed that
Umm
Chickens are cute
They , some of them are , little ones
Yeah , but those are chicks
But they're like this big
Ok , I should have respecified hens are cute
Making up words is fun
Sorry , go ahead
Umm
yeah
So , making up words is fun
Making up words is fun
What words are you making u
Umm , currentl
mhm
I'm not making up many , but , I mean , I could , I suppose
Essentially , the other conversation we had was about , was about the tendency of people speaking English , certain groups speaking English , to combine all sorts of random roots into new words , which most people then couldn't understand
Oh , wow
cause there's
That's splendiferous
That's a real word , though
Nah , real word , fake word , English is weird
And fun
Glad it was a first language
Yeah , me too
I like your tee shirt
Thanks
My grandmother went there
Johns Hopkin
mhm
I actually nominated my eighth grade math teacher for a Johns Hopkins award , and she won it , and she went there , and then she got me a tee shirt
So that's why I have a Johns Hopkins tee shirt
You mean , you're not a protoge of the schoo
Nope , nope , I don't think so
Not an advocote , or supporte
Nope
Mm
I was reading a very good science fiction story
Wha
Ummm
the Groping Hand
I havn't read that
I've never even heard of it
That's ok
Who's it b
Larry Niven and a coauthor that I don't know so well
oh , ok
Well , I have not read it
But , Niven's good
mhm , it's very interesting
Had any good dreams latel
Let's see , I had , well I told you I had a vivid dream the other night about , uh ,
vampires
vampires and carriage races
glass breaking and
Yeah , but let's see , there was one last night
I think it involved , like , western mysticism
Um , but I don't remember much about it
What do you count as western mysticis
Um , you know , western esoteric tradition , Kabbalah , Golden Dawn and all that stuff
I don't remember much except I woke up and was like , that's kinda funny , that was an odd dream and then I don't remeber it
I keep meaning on writing my dreams down , but then I forget
Or I'm just lazy
Your dreams , or do you forget to write them dow
I forget to write them down
I generally remember them for at least a few hours or more
At least recently
A few months ago , I didn't remember them at all , so that's kinda strange
You had trouble learning how to walk when you were younge
I had trouble learning how to skip
I don't think I had trouble learning how to walk
Oh , I don't know how to skip properly
I thought you did
No , I only know the wizard of Oz skip
What's the differnec
Umm
You go two feet and then switch two feet
reall
yeah
I've never noticed that
Is that what they do in the movie or is that just what it's calle
yeah
That's what they do in the movie
And apparently , I watched the movie too often when I was learning how to skip
People used to make fun of it
I think I learned how to skip in like third grade
It was
It was quite embarrassing
That's ok
You should try attempting to learn how to skip in highschool
But you can't skip now , or can yo
I can still do the wizard of Oz skip
Can you skip normall
Ummm
no
Do you want t
Learn how to skip normall
I don't really care , there's not much use for it that I've found
Ok
That's fine
I suppose
Hmm
So , how's Mat_Sci goin
Good
Umm , We learn about materials and the science and engineering around it
Isn't that interestin
Just like the titl
I'm probably taking intro to
We're doing the ring casting lab soon
Yeah , you told me that
That's really cool
I hope so
What is it , bronze , from the bronze you had befor
Was that bronze , or was it
Ehhh , brass , I think , bronze , something like that
Brass is the shiny one , and bronze is the hard one , I think
It was a long time ago , at least a month and a half
Oh , but so you're not casting it from the same stuf
No , we're casting it out of silver
I don't know if we're actually going to alloy the silver ourselves maybe I should find out
It might be a good idea before I actually go to lab
Yeah , so , how does one do this , or , how does one do thi
Castin
I mean , do you , is there a ring mold that you
Ah , yeah , there's many different ways to cast things
I don't know how we're doing it
I think we're using a hard mold
I don't know that that means
Yeah , well there's also casting with like stuff like green sand and
oh , ok
Yeah , um , are you o
Yeah , I'm fine
Ok
Do I not look o
No , you look vaguely , vaguely , what's the word , sultr
Sultr
Oh , yeah
Right , ok
I was dizzy earlier
That's kinda like sultry , only not
Yeah , yeah , same motion of the eyes , I suppose
Are you sleep
I'm very sleepy
Are you hungr
I'm not that hungry I ate earlier
Well , that's good
That's why I ate
because I was dizzy
And then I became less dizzy , but it took me a while
So , I'm uh , hoping I don't have mono , like , uh , everybody else
Except for Ed
Yeah
Even though his girlfriend has mono , he has no mono
Um
Let's talk about star constellations
Do you know anything about star constellation
I can recognize some , I
Let me guess , Orion's bel
I can recognize Orion , and , let's see , Orion and Taurus and Cassiopeia and there's somthing over here , which sometimes I know
But I don't remember what it is
It's generally the stuff that is overhead in my town , hometown during the summer
I see
I'm not good at recognizing star constellations
But I am good at using telescopes
Are yo
mhm
Which has nothing to do with star constellations
No , no , it really doesn't
mm mm But most people are better at that than telescopes
Um , well , how much skill is there involved in using a telescop
Is ther
I don't know
It's been a while
Depends on the telescope
Yeah , that's true
I know how to use several different kinds
I don't know , I never really got in a fight until , I mean , after I was twelve
I was a bit of a , I was the enforcer in , uh , first grade , actually
Um , and we had this little band , you know , there was like a clique , and
A band like Journe
A Journey cover ban
Yeah
You were in a Journey cover band when you were in first
Yeah , I was the drummer
no
Um , yeah , for some reason there , like , there were , like , four out of us that were you know
Like Will S , om R and I and Greg H
and for some reason I was the muscle
And occassionally I
You're so scrawny
You wouldn't seem to me to be the most effective
Yeah , I know , I know
Because I was vicious
And I beat the hell out of Danny H
who had a head that was like a beach ball
It was huge
I feel bad for people with really big heads
Yeah
We knew this guy named Mark
Um , big head Mark , who was in a really awful band
And , uh , his head was easily three sizes too big for his body
And he had , and on top of that he had this big curly hair
And , like , if you've got a big head already , don't get big hair on top of it
Yeah
Makes it look even bigger
It was really amazing
But , like , every time after that , like , when , uh , an occasion arose to be in a fight , one of two things were gonna happen
I was gonna lose , in which case I ran , and I was pretty fast
Or , two , I was gonna clearly win , and the other person backed down
That's a good way to fight
Yeah , that was what my dad taught me early , it was , like , you know , never fight a fair fight
In a fair fight , half the time you're gonna lose
Or you're , you're , you're gonna take at least as much damage as the other person
Yeah , so like , um , one time they had , I , the , the kids up the street wanted to get in a fight , wanted to kick my ass
So , we knew it , we knew they were , like , plotting to , like , catch me when I was out riding my bicycle , righ
So
This isn't a Simpsons episode
No , actually , uh , this was Tom R and all this stuff
It was really cool , cause I got , um , uh , ah shit , what was his last name
Nelson Munt
No
His brother was like the biggest dickhead on the planet , and I hated him
But , like , his older brother was kinda cooler and would occasionally give his younger brother a beatdown when he was being too much of a dickhead
Um , anyway , for some reason he sympathized with my cause , right
And he was , like , eighteen and he rode a BMX bike and all this shit , you know , like he was like , a lose
And we didn't realize it because we were little , righ
And , um , so anyway , he , uh
Because you have to be a loser to be eighteen and actually give a shit about anything in a twelve year old's life
Exactly , exactly
I mean that's clearly how much of a loser he was
He , he came to , like , my defense , righ
So , um , the idea was I rode like right through the hood , you know , like where , you know , they were , waiting
And , and that they came running out after me and then all my friends were just kinda like , magically appeared around me , like "/
hey , what's goin' o
You know , like , we're ready to rumble , righ
Of course , Pat's there , who's like , eighteen , or whatever , and you know , they're , they're all like "/
uh , hey , Pat , because you know they're all friends all of a sudden
And the fight didn't happen , cause we had overwhelming numbers
That's typically how it worked out
Either that or I had , like , a piece of lead on a string or something
That was one of my better , we would kick
A piece of lea
Did you give people lead poisonin
Yeah , you're , in thirty years , man , you're gonna have developmental problems
No
I'm gonna rub this lead on you
We had a , I , I had about uh , three inch cubes , cube of , uh , lead
And I drilled a hole through it , and put a rope through it , and then I had a tennis racquet that I had smashed earlier that
In a fit of rage
I cut the , cut the head off the tennis racquet just drilled a hole in the , like , tennis racquet handle , and tied the rope to it , so it was essentially like a homemade flail , and , er , mace , I guess , well yeah , flail
Whomping stick
It swings around
Yeah , cause , uh , Darren nearly got accosted by these , um , uh , two jokers from somewhere , uh , a different school or something like that
So we were all on the , we were gonna go administer a beatdown , right
And I don't know what the fuck I was gonna do other than kill someone
Yeah , that's not something , you can't really be half assed with that
It's like , there's like , you either don't use it , or you , you might as well just kill the other person
Yeah
Because you're gonna do so much damage
Yeah
Um , fortunately they were never found , so I never really got a chance
Or maybe they were just never found , and you shouldn't be talking about this any more
Yeah
That was the one time that Pat's younger brother , Brian G
that's what it is , G
Fucking dick
Um , he chased , uh , Tom and I , um , to Tom's hous
But we were just , uh there a little bit ahead of him
Went into the garage and pulled out like these pipe wrenches that were like were literally nearly as big as we were
And we were waitin for him outside but when he came around the side of the garage
And all of a sudden he's like "/
Hey , hey guys , what's going o
He chased us , like , for three blocks
And then struck up a conversation
Because we had big fucking pipe wrenches
You were just evil
Well , I mean , we never really
You know , it's display of force more than it was , like , actual use thereof
Girls fight in different ways
psychologists love this
Like , they go , they tear out , they tear , they go for the , they fight nastier when they actually get into it
Like , you don't wanna get , like
Like baby oil
But , well , no
But like guys , guys will just try to beat on each other , but girls will tear out giant clumps of hair ,
No , I meant , like , 'relational aggression
And go for , like , constant maximum Oh
Sure
No , I'm just talking about chickfights
Chickfights , like , like ask , ask any
Girls don't have physical fights anywhere near as much as guys
But if you ask a bouncer , bouncers know , you can , you can break up two guys who are fighting
They fight over a man
But , well , when you get , well , you can step , like if two guys are fighting , you can step between them and break them up
But if two girls are fighting you have to let them go , cause they'll scratch
It depends on the age
The last time I saw a girl fight I think they were like twelve or something like that , in which case it's just like two effeminate boys fighting , it's a slap fight
There was , like , I remember like , it was really funny , we engineered this whole thing that for some reason , there was this one dude in our school that we hated more than anyone else
Like , uh , Danny S
And he , uh , he actually dropped , we kicked his ass so much he left our school
Actually , he came to our school cause he was getting his ass kicked at public school
So we kicked his ass , and he went to , he went to Kiski
Where , where , like , all the troubled kids go
Like , it was , like , the , the private school
And he got his ass kicked there
What's wrong with this kid that made him get his ass kicke
He was just like
was he an asshole , o
Oh , he was such a huge asshole
Why didn't somebody just tell him , 'if you're less of an asshole , people won't wanna kick your ass
I , you know , reasoning with him really wasn't , like , I mean he was just clearly developmentally wrong
You mean he coulda been a special ed ki
Uh , I mean he was , you know , the scab picking , nose picking in the middle of class
Like just just I mean just repugnant
Like you just didn't want to be near him
Then , he was a dick on top of it , righ
And just not very bright , either , so , you know it all kind of worked against him
He was basically , he's the ape that the society would have just rejected
He was one of like those like
He would have starved to death
He was the one of the weird loner apes that would have been out in the forest
that , that
Flashing himself to other apes
Yeah
Uh , well , well , for instance , we were comin home one day , and of course , I'm playing my normal antagonist role
Right , and I never really physically fought that often
But I was a real dick when it came to , like , making fun of people
So I'm making fun of him and just basically circling him on my bicycle
I was just calling him all kinds of shit , righ
Finally , he gets pissed off and swings his bookbag and clips my friend in the face , who happens to be , like , the biggest fucking kid in eighth grade
Like , shaved in eighth grade
Oh my god
Actually
He shaved in sixth grade , he was still shaving in eighth grade
But , like , it was daily at that point
Was he , was he
Was he , like , had he been left back two grades or somethin
No , no he just and what's funny is now he's like small
He's a , He's a , he never got any
He was five eight in eighth grade , he is five eight to this day
Like , he just , grew , like I don't know
He bloomed , and that's it
Yeah , yeah , he races stock cars
Does that pay wel
Hu
No
Um , lemme think , his son should now be
You're , you're
should , should now be
If you say anything over ten
that's , that's bad
Fifteen
Oh , aww , aww
Fourteen , fourteen maybe
That's not good
Yeah
See , you shouldn't be a daddy when you're fourteen
Well , man , he was sixteen , I think , when he
Oh , well , that's different , that's really mature
Yeah
Yeah , you have a lot of experience
And his girlfriend
was older than him , she was like twenty three or twenty four
So that's , then she was a child molester
That is so wrong
Oh , he was great , he'd get like a case of beer for him and his girlfriend
And his girlfriend would have like two beers and he'd drink the whole case
When he was seventeen , like
Cause I think she bought the beer for him
Sounds like a relationship made in Heaven
okay
right , so , paper , um
paper , yes
we have to get this paper in by yesterday
i'm sure we can tell jason what to do about that
yes , i don't think that's a problem
anyway , so what's the current status , you were going to send me a draft on tuesday
i pointed you at a tex file on tuesday
okay , so you're supposed to remind me that i was supposed to read that file on tuesday
i did
when i met with you on tuesday
oh yeah
okay , so , i haven't read that yet
um
well good , because i've been adding to it all day today
good
so you didn't notice how little had been done yesterday , for example
uh , that's true
um , well done
uh , i've got a little over a page , most of the describing the method we did
okay
how we built a voice in noise , um , and then a little bit about how we generated the random sentences and a few examples
okay that sounds good
so , there's actually a p d f file
want to briefly show it to me
yes , if i can manage to get it to load
it could probably use a little bit of editing , but i have been going over it a few times
uh , it's gonna need more content as well
oh , obviously , yes
okay , um , du du du du , i want you to , okay , so i'll pick that up this evening
and have a pass and add stuff
so the things i'm going to add is uh , why we're doing this in the first place
though you maybe covered that already
uh , no , i really didn't cover that too much , although it could probably get covered in the sections that i've done
the introduction is probably a better place
the introduction is probably a good place to do that
on tuesday you did say you would do that
yes , i know , i do , i do remember saying that i would , uh , do that
um , uh
i'd like a breakdown of number of sentences , number of phones , number of diphones , number of triphones in it
uh , there's a similar breakdown in the arctic tech report
but it's not going to be exactly the same because we didn't use all of the arctic
and didn't even use all of one set of the arctic
that's fine , but there still is a set of phones , set of diphones to have for that particular set
and , uh , number of units , things like that
um , probably a description of the automatic build process that we do
um , uh , as with the , um , so we're trying to come up with a name for the one that jason and uh , arthur did
and so things like art_ick were coming in , because , uh , Arthur's a r t , that's his initials , but we realized that we have ark_tick , art_ick , and the articulatory database that we intend to do , especially if it's based on the ark_tick , uh , um , dataset with Art speaking it , and it's articulatory , it would get confusing so we decided to use another name
so uh , presuming its aesop's fables and cia world factbook
uh , and so that's , uh , facts and stories , or facts and fables , facts and fiction , um
and we identify which ones are facts and which ones are fiction , um
and a whole bunch of interesting things I won't say because i'm being recorded
you're not supposed to mention that , you're not supposed to remember that you're being recorded
this is supposed to be a natural conversation
i don't
i don't , because i'm recorded all the time , um
well , actually
then you probably are
yeah , i think i am
uh , you go to the ISL , you're probably recorded all the time , at least they reserve that right
um , right anyway , so we need to have a name for this that we're going to release , and the u r l , and we did decide on the nam
did we decide on the name , or did i decide on the nam
i think you decided on the name and didn't mention it to me
okay , um , so the name i was working with was swan
yeah , that's what i was
what we were using , i think that's okay
a catchier name might be better
yeah
but i'm not good at that
same here , so let's just
use swan
right , okay , so we have that , we're gonna have a u r l , so it's gonna be festvox dot org slash CMU underscore swan
it'll be pointed off the let's go page , but that's where it's going to be
right
that's the best place to put it
um
and there's a bunch of analysis that has to be done , sort of the things that we did with the duration modeling , and its overall , look inside the tables for that
i think i have the data for that
tables will take up space , that's good
yeah , exactly
i mean , wait , no , that's not what i'm supposed to say
ah , i see that you're learning what it is to be a graduate student
that's very important
i have a nice figure that's just a couple sentences that takes up a lot more space than the sentences themselves would if i just put 'em inline
yes , that works too
but it sets it off so nicely , it fits in perfectly
so it's an example sentence from the databas
three example sentences , not from the database but from the semantically unpredictable set
i see
that's the right thing to do
a few drunken bagpipes built the sneaky ideas
yeah , the speech recognizer's never gonna get that
um , good
i think that's fine , uh the only problem is , i really like to get this , so we're going to actually start the review process on sunday
um , so i'd like to have a paper by sunday
that would be good
for my own sake i'd like to be well done with this by sunday regardless
no , i agree
i have other things to do
that's the problem with having deadline extensions , it's like , they go into the next deadline
exactly
and i really can't afford to do that
so i am hoping to write more this evening , although i have , have to write other papers and a talk , and
the writing i'm less concerned about , it's the content that i'm very concerned about , cause we haven't done the listening tests yet
so i have to set up the listening tests
okay , good
that , i think is the largest worry , is the , the overwhelming priority , because if we don't have that , as much as i can make stuff up , i don't think that would be a good thing to put into a paper
um , yeah , you're not senior enough to do that
ah , so we'll just put you as the first author then
i'm not old enough to do that , i haven't retired yet
um uh , yeah
um , yeah , so as long as those listening tests get done tomorrow , i'm not , i'm not too concerned
especially if they get done early enough tomorrow
um , then i can , then i can get most of the paper written friday
the problem is that all of our wonderful students don't come in at eight AM
so , i'm assuming i am not participating in the listening
absolutely not
cause i know too much
you absolutely can't
you probably can
i think i can
we'll know which one it is , and if i'm weirdly biased , then we will exclude me
also , i think being a non native isn't an issue
probably not , it's general understandability so even if it's , if it's less understandable , there's the problem of you're listening to your own synthesizer , so
i think that's , that , i mean , i'm more tainted from that , but all of us have listened to too many synthesizers , so that's
and specifically too much festival
yes , exactly
um , uh , we'll try everybody else and see what they get
there will be issues in how to measure the result , we're gonna ask them to write down what they heard , we're gonna have to measure word correct , um
hmm , right , next is the let's go stuff
i'm still poking around with that , it's not ready yet
but that , granted that the paper will be done , or that i won't have anything to do with the paper in the intervening time , i should be able to get that done by monday morning at the absolute latest also
i'm look , i'm trying to get that done saturday
the absolute latest is saturday
that's fine , that's fine , i don't think that's gonna be buckets of work , i think that's just gonna be some bit of work
yeah , basically , i need to really delve in , i've only scratched the surface of what i needed to do , i've been poking around in those directories trying to find what the structure is , if there is any
it's not been encouraging so far , let's say
so i'm , i'm kinda hoping that i find , i find out that there is actually an underlying pattern to , logic to how we do , how we're storing it right now , such that i can just take what's there , rearrange it very slightly , or better yet , automatically , and go pfft here's a big , big bunch of files , zip it up and say pffft there ya go
zip and tar g z
um , so actually what i do , i think the other ones i do zip and tar b z
because i'm assuming that the tar people will have b z two
um , and , the other people won't know what it is any , won't know what g z is anyway , so it doesn't really matter
winzip knows g z
yeah , well , that's true
and it knows tar
yeah , it knows tar , but it trashes all the files
well yes
it puts , uh , control m's into
sometimes
okay , only when they're not needed
um , i told you about there's a thing in festival , with a line in the code that says if you're debugging and get here , cause , cause the database keeps falling over , the answer is the database was unpacked with winzip with smart CRLF transitions
cause we've , we've been in there too often
Just in case something
Just in case there's any wondering , hu
Two to you
I'm out
Out
Alright
I raise
Raise to four , oh now he's gonna get aggressive , just to
Uh oh
So you owe two
I'm out
All right , uh I I take that back , that was cruel
Yeah yeah , just give us a shot
So you owe two
So this is the one you said just automatically fold
Yeah , so that's right
So , we're all copaseti
Are w
Did anyone fol
No , no , but did you go i
To two mor
I raised , so she called two , so you need to call two more
You guys , everyone not in , yeah I need you to call two more
And you need to call two more
Hsien you're ou
Yep
Okay , ready for the flo
So , us five
one two
Well that's an interesting spread
I bet two
Aw he's just trying to bluff us out now , 'cause I , 'cause I won that hand
I just want to get your money
Two to you
I fold
She's not gonna let you get her money
I know
Um , you're still dealing though
Yes , did we , are we all i
Okay
Oh , nice , I wish I'd stayed
Um , I bet four
Pair of tens , and an ace
I'm out
You're ou
Four
That's a five Joanne
It's okay
It's okay , here , do you want this one bac
Thank you
Okay
Get it while I'm there
Yeah
Last card , flop
Down
Three
Didn't help
Once again , the three does nothing
So whatever you had on the last four cards is what you got , unless
Unless you have the four five , in that case you're good
Right
So it goes to you
I'll bet
Four more
I'm out
Mauree
Who else is in , anybod
Uh , Lyn and Joanne
There are a lot of people in
Four people total
Four to sta
Yep
Let's see , was I betting oka
Just look at the order
Three of a kind is like three hearts , righ
No , like three tens
No , like three threes
Oh , that's it
Okay
Because three hearts doesn't do anything
Three hearts is very easy to get
I check four in , for four
Alright , I've already lost then
'ka
I have aces
I have aces
As a matter of fact , I exactly match it
Ooh man
This your
And she has three
And I have three tens but you have the higher card
It does , it does , it does play , it does play
It doesn't matter on this
Yeah , 'cause of the ace nine ace eight
So she wins
Winner
Wait wait wait
wait
Wait , explain this again
But the other time I could say we both had ace , that ace
You have to build a five card hand
But you have to have a fifth card
So that's my fifth card
Ten ten ten ace nine to ten ten ten ace eight
If there was a king on the table then you split
Man that's close , that's a heartbreak
That one's a heartbreak
But I do feel better knowing that Nick stayed in with exactly the same hand , so I didn't make any worse judgement than Nick did
I shouldn't have
Alright , I need your cards Ekta , I need everybody's cards
Wha
There was a blue on
I made change
All right , then that's okay
Okay , I think those have been , yes
Yeah , those are shuffled if I remember well
I just got wrecked
By novices like us
Yeah that's right , by novices
I can't read you guys
That's right
Well I think it's harder when there are more people , righ
Yeah , it totally is
Okay , who's little and bi
I was too aggressive after the pair fell
She's little
I love how we all know what's going on , we pick up fast
Hey , they are chips
Joanne has more Doritos
I just gave you five
Okay , question is to Lyn
Wait a minute , what's going o
Wait a minute , that's two
We're all in
We're all playing
I call
Okay
So you owe one
I owe one
Ekta has to decide whether to raise
You can check , you can check or bet
I check
Woah hoo , look at that
A stellar , a stellar flop
That's right , that's right
Ooh boy
All right , let's go
My be
Yeah , 'cause you're next
So I can raise i
Two
You bet two
You can bet right now and still it comes past to you
Ahhh , I shouldn't have done it
I fold
Okay , flop
Wait wait wait
Everyone called you
That just means that everyone matched you
I don't know how this works
Now you can bet four , or check
I'm betting four
Heh heh , I love that poker face
I know , it's great
This game's all about looking your best
That's actually the way to play it
Yeah , that's it
, four
pair of threes , pair of sixes
Up to you , you can bet four
I'm betting four
Are you still in Nic
Nick what you're doing some more
Four Ekta
So you bet four , four to you
I'm out
I'm out
I'm out
So I can raise right , four and then raise , righ
Sure you can put your foot in
I know what you're thinking
I'm gonna bet eight
Eigh
Yes
That's a lot , I have more than you
That's a tough choice
I'm going to ask for a consultation
Well I've looked at the entire deck so I can't give you a consultation
So you can't comment
Hey , you're supposed to be the expert
I am
Well then why looking at the deck and you can't
Because now I know what the rest of the deck is
The rest of the possibilities are
Oh , alright
Lyn , are you still i
I'm out
moneybags
Hell
Okay , Nick's giving us good instruction
Want to come ove
Okay I'm going to fold
So it's only Roshon and
Did you look at my han
I have to stay where I am
I check
No , you owe four , righ
Yeah , I raised to eight so
Because he raised you
And now it's a call
Now it's just a call
You can also raise me
You can raise him back if you want
I only have one chip left
I have to get back to the game
Okay she calls
Has everyone calle
Yep
So , if you're in , you better have threes full of sixes , that's the winning hand
Hey , how do you kno
Full house
You would have split with him
So where's everyone fro
Dude where are you fro
Uhhh
marshemellow lan
Marshemellow lan
Yeah

Yeah , I mean you can listen to it while we're talking
Oh , okay

Oh , yea go ahead
It's like uhhh

Dude dude dude , we're cordless
We are
Oh you ar
Yea we're recording
It's not even funny though I dunno why you wanna
Hey this is pretty good
Dood it's a
it's a hilarious story
Okay so uhh
I go to Germa
When I was in umm
When I was in Germany
Righ
Umm I stayed at a hosts family for a while
And uhhh
When I first came in , you know , theres no Asians in Germany , like especially in the little Heidelburg I was in
So
Wait a second I'll be right back
Alright
So they see uhh
they see a
they found out that
Who wh
Don't you need an interactio
Yo , check this out
Japanese guy taking out the mic
Hey can I turn the music down a bi
Turn it of
Yea sure
You can turn it down
Wait so they
I'll wait till he gets back
Oh' I've seen these
You've seen thes
My friends usually try to kill me whenever I get access to one of these
Wh
Cuz I
I start getting a little controlling about the tracks and like
they not necessarily the most popular ones
Alright so uhh
Alright so
there's this uhh
umm
like exchange
not exchange program but when you visit there
There's all these uhh
umm
families from the town that signed up to host the
student from America righ
They're all excited cuz
I dunno they're just really nice people righ
Yea go on
So I go over to umm
fly over to Germany and then
once we get off the airport we go to uhh
the town where
where the bus unloads us
And all the host
hostile families right
host families were just waiting to see like
What's the what's the town called agai
Heidelburg
They're all waiting righ
To uhh
meet their uhh
hosts
I mean
the people
the person they hosted from America righ
And
You know they're probably hoping like , American , like a white dude righ
They see that im a
Asian or Korean righ
Like the family was just so
they
it was so bizzare cuz
they were hoping that I was white or some
like uhh American dude
but they see that I'm Asian righ
That's so cool
Did you see how that middle mic pics him u
Yea , I know isnt tha
So they take me in
They didn't expect an Asian dude righ
So they acted so like
they
they acted differently to me cuz an Asian dude is rare
And they
they treated me so different cuz I was Asian they
for breakfast
they all sat around the table right
and they watched me eat breakfast
All staring at me
they did
they just didn't leave
you know they
They didn't wanna just leave me alone
like they feed me and
it's like they don't even eat
they just watch me eat
Yea
he can
edit that part out
Yea yea okay
Sorry
I don't even think it really matters cuz
like
Cuz he can edit that shit out
Paul godamnit
No but they , they , so they were watch
all of them were watching me eat righ
So fucking
So embarassing righ
I told you it'd slip out
It's so embarassing right
so
Umm
It was for every meal too like
three meals fuh
a da
And I remember one dinner righ
The first dinner I ate with the
They cooked this whole pot of
it was
the stew literally this big righ
And they made like dinner for like twenty in that
in that stew pot righ
So they served me the first bowl
I killed
I just inhaled
I just inhaled it
In like
like a minute
I ate the whole thing righ
They thought I loved it so much they poured me more and I was like "/
yea sure I'll get seconds and thirds
and then after
after I said I want fourths that was like pushing the limit cuz
I only said it because uhhh I just wanted to be polite
My stomach was so full I swear it was like about to burst
And then
and when I was done
She just kept coming back with more bowls righ
Cuz she thought I'd just love it and I wanted to pay my umm
I dunno
I dunno I just wanted to
pay my gratitude just by eating their food
but even though I said no no no or
I dunno what was with them it got so scary the mother just came up to me , father sat down , like the son sat down , they're like this here
eat
And I'm like
you know it
like do I get any privacy and it's my sixth bow
She kept going back giving me seventh and eighths
I said "/
no I can't eat anymore right
and I was like "/
I can't eat anymore
I can't eat and they're just speaking German to me righ
I dunno what they're saying
Ha Ha Ha
No it was so scary and I
I was wondering if all the other kids are experiencing this too
cuz
you know they leave you alone once you
once you get off the bus and you're all
you know
high school students just go
go to their families righ
Tenth bowl came around and
and I'm not kidding when I ate fifteen bowls of that stew
Yea
It was fifteen I dunno how I did that that's the
that's the craziest number of bowls
but it was
it was soup so maybe it's believable but then
after seventh
it was like enough was enough I can't
I can't even eat anymore
And I somehow managed to eat like
eight more
Aren't your grandparents like that thoug
My grandparents are like that in Korea
Uh
They are but then
this family I just had to because
I couldn't communicate with them at all
Ha Ha Ha
Yeah
That's the same with my grandparents I can't really communicate with them
Man
This is slow
Yea
Ha Ha Ha
This is taking forever
Six minute
Six minutes
You gotta edit out some swears by the way
Oh no I don't think so

I left my uhh
windows rolled down
And the radio was still on very softly righ
But I just

And I just went up

We are
Oh you ar
Yea we're recording
It's not even funny though I dunno why you wanna
Hey this is pretty good
Dood it's a
it's a hilarious story
Okay so uhh
I go to Germa
When I was in umm
When I was in Germany
Righ
Umm I stayed at a hosts family for a while
And uhhh
When I first came in , you know , theres no Asians in Germany , like especially in the little Heidelburg I was in
So
Wait a second I'll be right back
Alright
So they see uhh
they see a
they found out that
Who wh
Don't you need an interactio
Yo , check this out
Japanese guy taking out the mic
Hey can I turn the music down a bi
Turn it of
Yea sure
You can turn it down
Wait so they
I'll wait till he gets back
Oh' I've seen these
You've seen thes
My friends usually try to kill me whenever I get access to one of these
Wh
Cuz I
I start getting a little controlling about the tracks and like
they not necessarily the most popular ones
Alright so uhh
Alright so
there's this uhh
umm
like exchange
not exchange program but when you visit there
There's all these uhh
umm
families from the town that signed up to host the
student from America righ
They're all excited cuz
I dunno they're just really nice people righ
Yea go on
So I go over to umm
fly over to Germany and then
once we get off the airport we go to uhh
the town where
where the bus unloads us
And all the host
hostile families right
host families were just waiting to see like
What's the what's the town called agai
Heidelburg
They're all waiting righ
To uhh
meet their uhh
hosts
I mean
the people
the person they hosted from America righ
And
You know they're probably hoping like , American , like a white dude righ
They see that im a
Asian or Korean righ
Like the family was just so
they
it was so bizzare cuz
they were hoping that I was white or some
like uhh American dude
but they see that I'm Asian righ
That's so cool
Did you see how that middle mic pics him u
Yea , I know isnt tha
So they take me in
They didn't expect an Asian dude righ
So they acted so like
they
they acted differently to me cuz an Asian dude is rare
And they
they treated me so different cuz I was Asian they
for breakfast
they all sat around the table right
and they watched me eat breakfast
All staring at me
they did
they just didn't leave
you know they
They didn't wanna just leave me alone
like they feed me and
it's like they don't even eat
they just watch me eat
Yea
he can
edit that part out
Yea yea okay
Sorry
I don't even think it really matters cuz
like
Cuz he can edit that shit out
Paul godamnit
No but they , they , so they were watch
all of them were watching me eat righ
So fucking
So embarassing righ
I told you it'd slip out
It's so embarassing right
so
Umm
It was for every meal too like
three meals fuh
a da
And I remember one dinner righ
The first dinner I ate with the
They cooked this whole pot of
it was
the stew literally this big righ
And they made like dinner for like twenty in that
in that stew pot righ
So they served me the first bowl
I killed
I just inhaled
I just inhaled it
In like
like a minute
I ate the whole thing righ
They thought I loved it so much they poured me more and I was like "/
yea sure I'll get seconds and thirds
and then after
after I said I want fourths that was like pushing the limit cuz
I only said it because uhhh I just wanted to be polite
My stomach was so full I swear it was like about to burst
And then
and when I was done
She just kept coming back with more bowls righ
Cuz she thought I'd just love it and I wanted to pay my umm
I dunno
I dunno I just wanted to
pay my gratitude just by eating their food
but even though I said no no no or
I dunno what was with them it got so scary the mother just came up to me , father sat down , like the son sat down , they're like this here
eat
And I'm like
you know it
like do I get any privacy and it's my sixth bow
She kept going back giving me seventh and eighths
I said "/
no I can't eat anymore right
and I was like "/
I can't eat anymore
I can't eat and they're just speaking German to me righ
I dunno what they're saying
Ha Ha Ha
No it was so scary and I
I was wondering if all the other kids are experiencing this too
cuz
you know they leave you alone once you
once you get off the bus and you're all
you know
high school students just go
go to their families righ
Tenth bowl came around and
and I'm not kidding when I ate fifteen bowls of that stew
Yea
It was fifteen I dunno how I did that that's the
that's the craziest number of bowls
but it was
it was soup so maybe it's believable but then
after seventh
it was like enough was enough I can't
I can't even eat anymore
And I somehow managed to eat like
eight more
Aren't your grandparents like that thoug
My grandparents are like that in Korea
Uh
They are but then
this family I just had to because
I couldn't communicate with them at all
Ha Ha Ha
Yeah
That's the same with my grandparents I can't really communicate with them
Man
This is slow
Yea
Ha Ha Ha
This is taking forever
Six minute
Six minutes
You gotta edit out some swears by the way
Oh no I don't think so
I don't I
It should be fine
As long as it's not too much
Should be cool
Talkin about your
german
sausage
Yo is that enough for you or do you want mor
Ohhh
Fuj
I can't tell my mugging story because it involves like black people and
It's racist
Ha Ha Ha
It's only funny if its racis
No , it's not racist but then
I'll try
I have to try hard to
you know
make it sound
Stop being so racist Son
Son you're so racist
Get out of our room
Ha Ha
Cuz black people in your class may hear it
There aren't many
but still
try to be policitally correct
The only person that's gonna hear it is my professor
I think
Because you have to FTP it to uhhh
the psychology serve
Alright then
I'll just use
you know
I'll just be politically correct
That means

Hu
That means anyone who wants to can download it
Oh that's fine
This isn't
is not top secret
Yo yo yo
I'm gonna tell you a story about my mugging then , in Boston
Oh I heard about this
This is good
This is uhh
This was the craziest moment
Righ
Cuz uhh
It involves a uhh
What would you do
in my situation
Yeah
And
everyone gave me the complete opposite answer cuz
they didn't take my route
Yo
so here's my story righ
I'm in Boston
and
I just came back from a party
and
I had like
I was
I drank like three beers and I was like ah oh shoot like
Oh I don't wanna drive home drunk righ
But still I forced myself to just driv
And
I had to take a piss so ba
I pulled her over in
in
out of all places its Cambridge its like the most safest
not safest place but
Its
yeah
Harvard
Harvard righ
MIT
I parked right outside of uhh
Cambridge righ
To stop by a par
And
There's only one street light
So I
I go all the way over there and I park my car
I parked my car first
and I leave my motor
I turn off my motor
and
I left my uhh
windows rolled down
And the radio was still on very softly righ
But I just
I just got out of the car
and I just left the door open a littl
And I just went up
you know behind the tree
And I took a piss righ
But then
you know
I was just chillin still and I
I
my friend called righ
My friend Louis
So
You know
I'm just like chillin and smokin a butt
and
We were just talking
he's like "/
what're you doing like
and we were just talking about stupid shit
And then
all the sudden
around that light righ
There's one ligh
These uh
I just turned around and I saw four mists
Under the light righ
It's like what the hel
righ
What's a mis
Four mists
just dark mists righ
And then I was like ohh
uhh
whatever and I'll just like turn around and just pretend like who cares righ
And then I look back
it's just four black people
Half
Twice my height righ
Four of them righ
And like theres no one around righ
And I'm like oh sh
oh shoot I'm in the ghetto righ
So I'm like alright
okay
This is what I can do I
I just zoned out from Louise and I'm like
I'm thinking to myself I could still talk to Louise
And then uhh
I could just
slowly hang up
put it in my pocket and just
just start running righ
Or
but
I was afraid that that might trigger a spark because you know black people just love to
Ha Ha so racist
I know
You know when there's some sort of action
Okay any
any kind of aggressive people
Yea
Eh
aggressive looking people
Like
if they see someone running thats like gonna trigger them to start running after you righ
Or they could just make you
that could
that could just make them pissed at you because they think that your being racist just cuz they're black you're running away
And then they'll chase you
Yeah
And they love action cuz when one black person runs all of em start running
But then yo
check
check this out righ
And I'm like uhhh
I don't wanna do that
because uh
you know
that's gonna
I dunno it's just I
I just choose to just act casual righ
Cuz I thought maybe if I just act casual who cares just minding my own business , doing my own thing righ
They're just gonna walk past me righ
And I just
tried to play it off
So I did that
and then uhh
And then I turned around I'm like Louise
uhh
theres
I dunno what to do there's four guys approaching me right now
So I turn around righ
And they just walk past m
One of them just grabs my collar righ
And I just
I just uhh
fall straight dow
And then uhh
I get back up righ
And then three of them just jump m
And they push me down I don't understand , it takes
they all
they all came and jumped me and I was just like half their height righ
So they pick me back up and they're
they're like 'what the hell are you doin
what the hell are you doin
swearing and shit righ
and this , this one black dood just takes a big blunt hit and blows it right in my face righ
And then I'm like , right then and there righ
Something went right under my ribs
Yea
And I was like oh oh shoot righ
And I just froze righ
And then , dood like , I was so pussy righ
Like at that moment , I bet everyone would act like this too righ
So , he ordered sheets of money from the Treasurer , ok , and you , you , they're not , they're uncut
Right
So he gets these sheets in the mail and he sets out in front of the cashier and cuts them out
He cuts them out and hands them to the cashie
You didn't get those from the Treasury did yo
and he says yep , yeah
You can do tha
Yeah , he got a sheet of twos and a sheet of fives
Dude
That's awesome
They cost him more , though
yeah
like , a sheet of fives is thirty two fives and so it should only run only about a hundred and fifty dollars dollars , but it runs about a hundred and eighty
Oh , that makes sense though , but it's still cool
No , it's not cool
I don't know why you pay more , to like , do their work for them
So , I think it's because they have to keep track which bills they've , like , sold uncut
So that if somebody calls them and is like "/
Well , we arrested this guy for counterfitting money
did you actually sell this to hi
and they have to , like , be able to keep track of the serial numbers or whatever
okay
Oh , let me see
what's in ther
what do you cook with Heinz ketchu
Everything
we have like Cho
They should have a Theresa Heinz cookbook
So i actually brought that the recipe for chocolate cake is bad
Ketchup in i
Yeah
but , uh , its it's a cookbook , using Theresa Heinz as the ingredient
Wait , you have to share
you have to share
Brownies with Hein
You put
You put ketchup in brownie
and chocolate cak
Oh , it's called Surprise_Chocolate_Cake
That funny because you bite into it
And you're like ahaha surprise
I put ketchup in the chocolate cake
Wow , there's
You can make cookies
and spice cake
They have ketchup in the ingredients
but then they never use it
I hope
Oh , God
Well , a quarter cup Heinz Tomato ketchup
No , they actually do it
One , sift , sift together flour , soda , and salt
You know , for my conversation i wanna have a theological debate
That would be great
I was thinking of recording my , uh , my Philosophy , my Philosophy of Language class , but that would be annoying
So I just added Tepper to my list of interests
Look , number three
Add ketchup and egg
Mix well
Something transcend
a play
you would prefer tha
So Akiva and I want to memorize that or
That or Waiting for Godot
for the desk attendants in Mudge
cus they're always in there
they're always just sitting there
we always walk in together
Because you're lover
No cus we're roommates
oh
Zucchini Lasagna
Lover
I'm just really
I think I'm really afraid of anything that has
anything that's a desert that has ketchup in it
I'm afraid of anything with ketchup in it
That's true
I'm afraid of that also
It'll kill you
Actually , my mom used to make lampchops with
with ketchup
and it didnt taste bad at all
But look you can make cookies
and
Surprise Chocolate Cake
You bite into it and you're like ahh
It's full of ketchup
It's so disgusting
Surprise Chocolate Cake' is ketchup
Surprise
The surprise
Surprise
That the surprise
it's made of ketchup
Surprise , I'm made ketchup
Turkey Chili
Porkchops
But , like , I can understand chili and porkchops with ketchup
Right , Right
0
But brownie
But cake and
and cookies
My neighbor actually makes a really good zucchini chocolate cake
ew I dont think I really like zucchini in chocolate cake
I've made zucchini chocolate cake chocolate chips
So like
How does that wor
does it taste like zucchini at al
No , you kind of , like , grind up the zucchini as much as possible in , like
the food processor
and , and it's just better for you than real chocolate cake , I guess
There's , like , little flecks of , like , green skin in it too
you look at it and you're like ew
That's why you peel the zucchini before you , before you use it
Does it , uh , have milk in i
Ok , I could understand minestrone
Let's see ketchup in , ummm
Oh , God , adding ketchup would be so
That's mustard
mustard is good
Mustard is inherently ennobling
No , because mixing , ah , ketchup and mustard both in chocolate cake does not make better chocolate cake
Oh , God
Mustard Ketchup Chocolate Cake
No , no , it doesn't
but we should make the chocolate cake , but replace all the ketchup with mustard and see how it tastes
Idiots
I don't think that was
Mustard is inherently good and ennobling
Use honey mustard and maybe , not just regular , not regular mustard
Use spicy mustard in the chinese restaurant
Mustard has mustard in it , oka
Oh , god
Hu
Spicy Mustar
You don't want spicy mustard in your chocolate cak
I'd like to make , like , a really rich chocolate cake with , like , made with lots of capsaicin
Oh , no
Oh , God
That would be so wonderful
I wonder if you could put wasabe in the cake
Oh , God
okay , wasabe is amazing in wash mashed potatoes
So , I always like roasted garlic with my mashed potatoes
Like , I'd like to make a chocolate mousse , except with capsaicin
Like if I ate it , I'd be , like , Chocolate
oh my God , t burns
That would be so good
Oh my God
It'd be so wonderful
Well , my ex bought this hot sauce the other day at , uh , at Giant , at , uh , Giant Eagle
It comes in a medicine bottle
It comes
in a medicine bottle and you take it out and it has an eyedropper
So we put an eye dropper , like , one drop of
the stuff mixed in with what we made for dinner that night
and it was so hot
It was
ridiculous , like we were both crying
So it was like pure capsaicin
and
its like
yeah
And I don't know
I'm not
I'm sure capsaicin is regulated
Well yeah
It is
Ah , otherwise otherwise you would put that stuff in a spray bottle and carry it around instead of mace
Then it would melt someone's skin off
Um , yeah
Pretty much
There are , there are , there are laws regulating how strong you can make mace
Right , well
That's why you can't buy pure capsaicin
Or , actually , I mean there are laws regulating civilian use
I like those capsaicin paintballs
I'd like that
That sounds
that sounds terrible
No , it's fantastic
They're high velocity paintballs filled with um capsaicin powder ,
Um , so notonly do you get the paintball welts , you know , but then , like you can't breathe
Oh , no
That's so mean
And they have splash damage too
So you can , like , shoot one there , you know
and then , like , going in your eye
Yeah , isn't that grea
No
Use them in public
For only two hundred eighty bucks
Ow
Oh God , how many do you ge
Ah , ah , ah , two hundred eighty bucks for for for , uh , for a semi automatic , uh , it's it's a little bit bigger than a pistol , a bit lighter , uh , it's c o two powered
Its basically a high velocity paint ball gun
and you get , uh , you get as many as about twenty practice shots and like
ten real shots
Uh
It's set up to six shots a second
Uh
Law enforcement can get , uh , like , can , like , actually get automatic paintball things for the hoppers
You know
that kicks
It also looks silly cus there's a hopper full of capsaicin fluid on top
It's like , what the is that paintball gun paintball gu
It would be great if they had Super_Soakers and just , like , a lot of capsaicin powder
and just a little bit of water
you know , and then you're at a riot and your like "/
oh , you can't do anything to me , stupid cop , with your
little water gun
Spray
It would be better if it was like if it was hydrochloric acid
Well hydrochloric acid would just kill a lot of people
I don't think that's the intent
I think the intent is just to melt their skin off
That's it
You know , a couple of shots is enough to incapacitate someone
And they're not restricted in any wa
I believe they are restricted and possibly not legal in several states It it it's new technology so I don't think there are laws for it in a lot of places
I made the posters
You made poster
You made poster
I designed posters
Remember I was asking you for slogan
Were they put anywher
Yeah
Were'd you put them u
You gotta put those up
No I never , never printed them or anything
You should really

Just hand it in like that
That's my Chemistry class right now
I know but I like to finish it and then hand it in
I hate handing in the unfinished one

So now I gotta go beg for a
completion chance , after the , uh

Then why'd he fail you anytim
You know

Alright
Boxerman
me and Treacy
Maybe , uh
Yeah , you and Treacy
Maybe h , maybe Healy
Maybe Sean
It's a long shot
But it'd be good if he was good there , because , well , he's not gonna be good anywhere else , so
Yeah
He's not gonna be great anywhere else , Sam
That's true
He's gonna be good everywhere else
That's true
He's a great kid
I wouldn't mind getting timed if we had
Oh yeah , Scott
Any chance of it
Oh
We'll take that
Part of the highest placing B team , ever
Hill two
Fifth place
Where's your troph
That's good , that's good
One of those shorter ones
Actually , it's one of the taller ones now
What kind of person do we need on hill tw
I don't even know
It's impossible to describe
There's just
You can't
There's like
You can't judge a person
You really want speed
You really want strength
Like
I think speed is more important
Eh
It's like you can get it running faster so you don't have to shove it as hard
Or you could be slow but give it a huge shove
But if you're slow , you're still slow over the whole hill
Yeah
Ed sucked last year
Yeah
He was with the B team ther
Yeah
And he did , he had a shitty rollou
Uh , he was slow , on the , uh
I mean , his time was just slow
He got a shitty rollout , or n
It wasn't good
I mean , Derrick had a really bad hill three , so probably
Derrick's hill three , I mean
What was the hill three tim
These times are all sketchy , but Derrick on raceday had an eleven five
Which is slower than push practice by a lot
Last yea
Which one did a hill thre
Last year
So
Good thing we don't have to worry about getting him again
Ed
Yeah
Didn't Ryan Gelfand graduat
Yeah
Yeah
He's on our soccer team
Wha
If you'd look at the list , he's definitely
He's like the first name on it
Did he graduat
I
he told me he was
He must have graduated
He's older than us , I know that
He was like , I'm not pushing
And he might be doing something
Because
I don't know , yeah , I guess he's faculty or something
Facult
Maybe staff
Staff
Alright
I can't remember that one
Aw did you see all the pushers on ther
Hu
No , I didn't look at it actually
All the pushers
We got Jocelyn , Karen , Ben
Nice
Awesome
I want to see someone
Indoor socce
Is that what we're talking abou
Let's get
Let's get someone injured , hu
What do you sa
Can we play real hard core and get someone hur
Maybe Jocelyn , maybe twist an ankl
Yeah , that would be good
Better than Nick
We're talking indoor soccer , thoug
Yeah
Yes
I like indoor soccer
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow nigh
Yeah , like nine or ten o'clock
Hot damn
Where are yo
Scott's with it
Am I not getting email
All , our whole , uh , two game season
Keep the team together , for , through that
Two games
It's the whole seaso
Yeah
And what's the point of the if you forfeit one , you're eliminate
Who else are they gonna pla
No , no , no , if you , only if you forfeit two
If you forfeit one you're still in it
That's , Margot said a different thing
Yeah , Margot said if you for either one of them , you're , like , out
What's the
I don't understand
But on the , uh , schedule , posted in the UC it says
the normal policy
It's just like , it's the standard policy
Oh
The , after , after your second forfeitry , you're out
And they said we only have two games so I just thought we could miss one and
Yeah
Right
That was one of my first thoughts
I was like "/
that doesn't sound right
No , there are seriously so many divisions , though
It's hilarious
Reall
There's three teams in every division , and , like , the division letters go up to , like , S or Z or something
I don't know
Why do they have that many division
Who's in our divisio
Did you loo
I don't think it was anybody noteworthy
Um
Is Bassketcase all good for tonigh
We don't have to do anything crazy for it , do w
I mean , it's like
Yeah
It has a drop wheel in the back
It looks good
Bassketcase is going tonigh
On hill on
I know that's
What are yo
Drun
That's what I was saying
It's not
That's just mean
We don't have that much control over it really
It's like
I know
I know
Scott's saying it's
No
It's strength training
Scott's trying to
Scott's trying to downplay
I know it has an effect , but it has an effect on all hills
It's strength training
But hill one
I know that's
is , like , the hardest one
So many people have , like
Alright , maybe it's just Ronette
But I feel like it's been more people that they are like "/
I tried a hill one once
I'm never doing it again
Things like that
Just cause it's like
There wasn't much of an option
I mean it , it's either that or only one buggy
What's the other bugg
Jess
They're gonna fight me
I don't know
Whoever knows what's going on
We'll , tell everyone they'll get one on each
I know , but then you want to get your first or your second
I know , everyone wants to go first on Blackjack , though
I want to
I know I want to
Make some of the people go first on Val and then
Just tell them that
It's , it's tough
I don't , I don't like the situation either , Sarah
It's strength training
But it's also , like , one of , like , the few data points we have on everybody
Somebody's gonna get screwed and get Bassketcase twice , and not make B team
I'm calling it right now
I'll make sure it doesn't
We are recording buggies on all these righ
We have that
Yeah
All that information
Mm , not for
Not really
If by yeah , you mean no
Well , last night was all Blackjack
Last night was all Blackjack
Ohhhh , ok
And then before that was Insite and Blackjack labeled
Yeah , we did that one
Is the other book , does the other book have
Hill five was all Bandit
Hill five was all Bandit
So , we do still have that
We should make sure to keep track of that information
Yeah
And we do still have buggy
Like days where we'll be timing hill one
Do we have the total weight combinations of buggy drivers and
Why'd you write both time
You can't just average them for me or somethin
We have two more
Oh yeah what is your policy on tha
We only have two more days
after this
Two more days of push practice
One of which will get rained out
What are you talking abou
Plus wha
Oh
I'm confused
I'm confused
I know , I know
Why , why only two nights this wee
I'm talking this one
And Scott was like "/
we have more days to time hill two
Hill one
But really , we only have two more days of push practice on hill one
I see
That was just on hill one
Yeah
I thought you were saying push practice in general
No , no , no
No , no , no , no , no
The same buggy's gonna be out on hill one all the time
What was it last wee
Not the same
Pushers have the inflexible schedule
Like March
Do drivers just sign up for a day
Because , you know , sometimes you have a test on Thursday
Sometimes you
What's toda
Twenty three
Is it generally supposed to be the schedule thoug
My , it's close to midnight so my watch is in between
It's twenty three or twenty four
One
Tomorrow's the twenty fourth
Three twenty three
Why did I do tha
No
Tomorrow's the twenty fourth
Today is the twenty third
Which have you been counting 'e
What was last Wednesda
Monday was the twenty first
Seventeen
Or Sunday was the twenty first , which was , uh
The equinox
My policy is
I don't know
Some of these are so different
How are we gonna get their time
That's why you average
Now I spelled her name wrong
We never even put more than one time down
Carla did
Hill five , Carla did it
Oh ok
How do you do thi
Average the
Like , I don't know , this one
We just take the lowest time
Aw , you d
Yeah
Wha
I mean , if they're close
You just take the lowes
As long as you're consistent
Why don't you averag
I mean , we've had different numbers by a little
Because we don't have a calculator
It's usually , it's not like a significant
No , when we had three people , we took the middle
Write em both down
Write em both down
That might explain some things
Scott's in control of the top of the hill Sam
You said you'd never been there
I know , or I would have changed this policy
You don't know the dynamic of the top of the hill
Oh , just write all the information down
That's so bad
What does this sa
I'm not writing it down , but
Shows the middle one
Bertucci just , Bertucci just said you're in charge
I am in charge , yeah
Aw , just write them all down and we'll average in excel
Aw , we can just put em in excel and average
Aw , that doesn't bother yo
That makes my skin crawl
Just taking the lowest one
Wh
That's like , goes against every like
scientific , statistical
That's like goes against the spirit of science
Oh no
Sure you have more than one data point
Take the one you'd rather see
Ohhh
Let the pushers decide what their time was
That was about a ten and a half
Sure , we'll use that
The lowest one
Don't make it sound so bad , we took the middle one last night
We had three watches and we took the middle one
Yeah when we had three we took the middle
Uh , oh , boy
Take the middle and round down , which happens to be the first when you only have two
Scientific method
As long as you're consistent
They were always really close , so
I mean
Eh
We're talking like two tenths of a second off
Two tenths
Yeah
This is one thirty eight and seventy one
I guess if you like figure it out
Wha
That's three tenths
There were a couple times when Scott was real late
Right , I mean
Obviously we're not counting the times when I screwed up the time
And Preysman every single time , when the light got covered , he just started his stop watch
It'd just be a flurry of clicking
Preysman was doing a lot of pushing
That's funny
He'd do , you , start , shit , stop
Stop , reset , star
Yeah
Yeah , that's guaranteed good timing
Oh God , when I was hanging out with Kappa
They were
Megan was doing the flashlight
And she was doing , like , uncover the flashlight , like all different times
And like after like seven rolls , she was like
It like came up somehow or I like mentioned it and she was like "/
yeah I don't really know when you're supposed to uncover it
I was like "/
When the nose crosses the line
Oh my God
She was doing like the nose , the back of the buggy , the pusher
Even if you don't know , just pick one
When the , when the load shove goes
Like
She didn't have any of consistency at all
She was just doing a mix of all the different things it could be
See , that's data points there
At least you don't just take , like the first one of every set
Average , average
hey Stusheena
Stu
hey
Stu should give birth in outer space
hmm
outer space , e
with robots
Stu
did you find your boo
no , not yet
oh geez
I'm working on the stuff
oh , that's good
have you guys seen a thing of memory , recentl
no
no
wha
those lil cute little things
memory for like a , laptop board
whoa
like , recently
yes
well , I when did so , you lost it recentl
no , have you seen it recently
well , so
yeah , I might have it
this is yours from a long , long time ag
like , a couple weeks ago
oh , I I think I have one of yours from , like , September
okay
here you go
okay
put it in the blinking ◉jar◉ , maybe
what are you up t
um I'm going to think some more about what I just read
no
couldn't you just go to bed
what did you just read , Stu
I was reading about the motion or , rather , the constraints you can place on what happens when you uh have an object sliding with friction
um some sort of Minikowski sum
you see , this core formulation is only through planar objects , and so
I think that it it extends because the force can it can project all the forces so that they they lie in a plane with the center of mass and all the torques and the sums are about the same
well , of course , Stu
I mean , like you know the thing , like um /
yeah , yeah , yeah
line of force like if you have a force , it can be anywhere along the line and you get the same torque and sum of force
I never heard that before , but it makes sense
a system of protein transport in the golgi
will have a population of n identical proteins
each can be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum /
I have an endoplasmic reticulum
I bet you do
do you remember what it doe
uh , no
but Rori just told you
are you interrupting St
yeah , that was the general idea , with something even more , um
obscure
fascinating yeah
whoa okay , biology's a lot more applicible than Stu's force lines , but I dunno
sorry , Stu
Slashdot seems to think Epson is releasing this printer just because , um
the team eight thin
yeah , women now dominate the consumer electronics market
I think they were , um
I think the implication in the story was that , like , or , things don't cater to women and then the guy was like , but they do dominate the market , or maybe I just read it wrong
yeah , I can't find it
I don't think /
okay
I don't think I've seen it in a while , but I'll let you know /
okay
you're talking about a little flash memor
yeah , Dell wants it
Dell wants i
yeah
wh
wait , flash memor
like a little , i_o u_s_b um what do you call the
oh , oh , I'm thinking like a s_i_m_m
oh , okay , cause I have yours of that
really
it was it was in here for a long time
what is it
I dunno
someone told me it had your resume on it
I think your resume's on it
or something like that
oh , that thing
yeah , yeah , yeah
oh , you have tha
well , it was in here /
dude
I was keeping an eye on it , but
yeah
I even told you , I mean /
I haven't seen that in a long time
yeah , it was in here
I don't I don't know where it went , though
yeah
Stu probably ate it or something
oh , yeah
probably
they're so tiny
he gets a little munchy
silly Stu
yeah well , I'll let you know if I find it
like , mmm , force vectors
It's true
okay
ah , crap
how long should I record fo
one million years
yep
actually , I was thinking 0of taking a shower and I dunno if the noise would uh mess up your recording or not
I dunno , I'm probably gonna stop , fairly soon
well do you think you have enough , like
I /
I could bitch about this boy if you want
have been recording for thirty three minutes
what's that
what bo
it's some boy who's an asshole
wait , say wha
no , he's just some guy who I don't like
I enjoy bitching about him
oh , you could bitch about him , oh , I see , I see /
so , if you wanted to , you know
I don't wanna force conversation here , cause
oh , okay
yeah
I could try and figure out who this guy is on Orkut who says that he wants to get to know me better
a friend of a frien
yeah
oh , reall
who's he a friend o
uh , Jen Lin
oh
that's why he's /
he goes to CM
yeah , I think so
think I fingered his account
I forget what I found out
what's his nam
Scott Linze
Scott wha
Linzer
yeah , Doctoral of Computer Science
Stu , do you know a Scott Linze
name's familiar
does anyone have a leve
a what
a level , like , that thing with a bubble and some line
no
no
no your mom
mmm , no
wh
um
it a leve
make her horizontal
I thought I would take some tinfoil and level the uh
I would call it a leveler , if anything
burners on the stove
no , you'd call it a level
mmm , okay
cause you're psychoti
wait , what's thi
ok
it just annoys me , like you try and cook and egg and it all like to one side of the pan , and
I think it's the house , Stu
well , whatever , I can still level it
the hous
why don't , you know , just put an egg in a pan , and use that as your leve
I you can just put some water in a pan and
that's what Kevin and I used to , like , level my desk went and got like , you know /
newspaper
no , Kerry's cu
and /
wha
I think you should use newspapers on the stove
it's , the gradiated , big , like , four cup thing , or whatever it is , and /
oh , that's Matt's cup
it's Matt's cup
whatever Matt's not here
dude
it's still Matt's cup
okay
and if I don't traditionally drink from that
wait , did he like , bring it with him and leave it here
no , it's just like he /
when he /
whenever we go to Kerry's house , she's got like that same , like , measuring cup thing in her house in northern Virginia , and Matt will take it and fill it with all with water , and drink it
we call it Matt's cup
oh
alright , is this the measuring cup I was using for tea today
so , we didn't
no , that's the /
other measuring cup
you used a small one
no , like the big rexan one
we're talking the big pyrex one
yeah Rexan , no whoa
mmm , aluminum
microwave safe
is just a corporation no
in this problem , we will be looking at the model of my asshole
what
nothing
so , what do you thin
do we accept an Orkut dat
what does that entail
that's the purpose of Orkut , isn't i
I dunno
he invited me to some party
oh
hey , do you know Sue Yi
yeah
okay , no , I was just like , looking on Orkut , and I was like , aww Chris Smoak is her friend as well
yeah , I noticed you were , wait , and Kerr
no , not her , no
no , not Kerry , but you , yeah
yeah , she I work with her , so
oh
oh , also Erik mentioned
how do you know her
your name
um , she was one of the people I helped out a year or two ago in two twelve or something
who're you talking to
when I was
I dunno
like in the cluster for /
yeah yeah , I rememeber
hours a day , helping students
and you'd come back and be like "/
I just helped people for seven hours
yay
yay
which had /
exactly
yeah , what were you saying , Kerry
oh , um , Erik mentioned your name
Erik
um
Ober
yeah
Meyer
yeah , I hate how's he's got a hyphen in his name
something or rather
yeah , that guy
yeah , he said , "/
you know Chris
I said "/
yes , I live with him
oh , you should tell him that
he owes me a stapler , dammit
okay
borrowed a stapler from the no you don't have to tell him
he borrowed a stapler from the AB office the other day , but he like gave me a thousand staples and
no , five thousand staples , and he and he took a thousand , but um
oh , yummy
then there was this big note on the board today that was like "/
where is the staple
and I was like "/
uh , oops , he didn't bring it back
yeah , he was telling me all about linguistic theory
oh yeah
because , when I was up at four am working on a paper , he was up at four am working on linguistic theory homework
right
mmm , it's not linguistic theory , though
oh , well he was working on multiple homeworks , but one of them was for that class , yes what which class was tha
right
we're both in Formal Semantics
Formal Semantics , yes
but , he's also in something else
um , yeah he was like "/
oh yes , and there's one other undergraduate in the class with me /
yeah
and I was like "/
I bet I know
yeah
I didn't say anything , but then I was like "/
ah ha ha
mmm ah it's a good story

Mmh mmh
It was too hot
Why are there bone
Well , because this is fish
Ryan most fish have bones
The only thing is that most of the time they fillet it

Real fillet
I want to get another chair
Mm
Wha
Dad , where's Rachell
She's in the shower

That's all the cheese you gave me
That's i
Wh
because the girls have to have cheese , too
Well , I didn't have any
Cut yourself , here
do you need a knif
No
There's more cheese , Ryan
Where did they have the party , down in the basement or throughout the hous
Basement
Uh huh
Laura was down ther
Only sometimes
Oh
She's like "/
We don't allow underage drinking in this house
She was joking
Is that what she sai
They were playing games , uhh , like college , plays ping pong Yeah , beer pong
Beer pong
You throw ping pong balls in the beer and you have to drink how ever much is in it
There's no more beer in the house anymore
Do you know how much there wa
No
How muc
Atleast , uhh , fifty bottles of Corona Extra and same with Heineken
That's a lot of beer
So
It was a mixed party , righ
guys and girl
Mmh hmm
Anything else going o
Some people left early because the beer was out
Is that tru
Would you ever allow i
No
You have to be twenty one to be drink
and not only that
Even if you guys were all twenty one
you have to drive home
No , no , no , I wouldn't have a thirty five people party becaue when they leave , if they're drunk from here and they get into an accident , the person that hosts the party is responsible
What if they go home and they go back out again by acciden
Mmh it's your fault
I don't know
I don't know , but I'm telling you , it's very , very strict
What's stric
The , uh , host liquor laws
What if they go out an hour later and get in a car acciden
it's your faul
Yeah , if you gave them too much to drink , yeah
If you gave them anything to drink
What about , about the next da
Mm
No , no
the next day
No , obviously no
the alcohol has worn off
But if they , if they have over a , uh , the legal limit and it's because you gave it to them then you're responsible until they go under the legal limit
even if they're under the legal limit and they get into an accident , I think you're responsible
That's why people don't have big parties anymore
Really , it's a big issue
Nobody should drink
Yeah
Or any , uh , or any other type of drug
Isn't that what's her nam
Jamie got so drunk
she had four whole bottles of Corona
Wha
Jamie had four bottles of Corona
Holy
She is in ninth grade

He he he he he he he he
Ha he he he he he he he he
I think there's the greens are in someone's hand
I did this with somebody else and the other girl was like a really soft talker
You just have to make sure you know where the mic is and make sure it's pointing towards the direction
like if you're facing in that direction , it's probably not going to pick up as well
Ok
You just think about it
I mean it's just like we record stuff for music all the time and we have to make sure we know where the mic is so that it picks up on us
That goes to show how much I know what I'm doing
Tape recorders
It's one of those technological things
fun
that , you know , I don't know very well but I can use a tape recorder
Ok , that's good , because I can't
So guess what
Wha
Mr Thompson told me that I've got an A for the semester
Oh , yes
Because of my breathrough
He like came in during intermission at the concert and he was like "/
That's what I've been trying to get you to do all semester
You've just earned your A
Yes , finally
So what breakthrough was thi
He was trying to get me to play louder and fuller and with like a better sound for most of the semester
And it finally like
it wasn't working
Like he was trying to like do everything he could think of to play better
And then he gave me a new reed
Like he gave me his new reeds that he's using
And like I put the reed on and ⁎boom⁎
It was like perfect
It was so much better
It was exactly what he was trying to get me to do and it was an equipment problem
Oh , wow
It was not a lack of understanding between me and him
And it was not for lack of his telling me what to do and me following what he wants me to do
I just needed different reeds
Oh , this is really good
I know
It was such a simple answer to a problem we've been trying to fix all semester
Wait
So how old was your other ree
It's not that it was old
It's a different type
Oh
This type was better
Ok
Like , well it's better for me , not for everybody
Yeah
Some people don't like them , but I like them
Oh , ok
So I have to buy two boxes of reeds tomorrow
Oh , jeez
Wait , how often do you have to change the
These last longer so it will probably last me like a month
And then I have to start breaking in new reeds
Wait , only a mont
Wow
Well my old ones last only about a week
Oh jeez
That's pretty bad
Reed
Yeah , they're pretty expensive to do
Oh no
But the new ones , apparently for him Mr Thompson he'd been using them for a month and he got eight out of the ten that he liked
Whereas in a normal box of the ones that I'm using now , they last about a week and I like about three out of the box of ten
Wow
So it's a lot better deal
Yeah
Definitely
So did you go out on Saturda
Yep
And it was fu
Yeah
I wore my skirt
Reall
Yeah
Very nice
And it's pink
Pin
Yeah , it's like the only pink thing that I have
That's fabulous
Actually if my mom hadn't been here I probably would have gone to a party on Friday night
Yeah
The sophomore vocal majors were throwing their cast party for the , um , for the convocation that they did on Thursday
And part of it , like , revolved around their solfege class
Like there was a big scene and so you know everyone in our solfege class was invited
Everyone was told about it so I was like "/
I have to spend time with my mother , so I won't be able to go
Yeah especially since she like came all the way from Texas
Exactly
exactly
But I did go shopping
Shopping is fun
Do you want to see what the stuff looks lik
Yes
Ok
Here's the shirt
this is pretty plain
Oh it's a really pretty color though
I like this color
It happens to be one of the few that looks good on me
And my skirt , I hung up
Oooh , that's pretty too
It's this nice fabric
And it's like
it's really long , which I love
I love longer skirts
And all this fabric , it sort of like goes out
There's so much of it
Oh so it's like a poofy one
Yeah
So it's like a big skirt
oh , that's fun
I love
So that's the new skirt
And then the shoes
Shoes are so
Oh yeah , we have to see the shoes
Ok
here's the tennis shoes
Oh , those are pretty
Black and pink
They're kind of like Cathy's
kind of
I like them
I was just looking at them and they fit better than the other ones I was trying out
And these are so adorable
These are my new concert shoes
Oh , those are really pretty
Wow
And well what I was looking at a pair of black pants at the Gap that were fabulous
They fit well and everything , but they weren't long enough though
Oh no
They would have been okay if like they came down to here and they had a cuff , so if I had taken the cuff out then pressed them , they would have been okay , but I'm going to go online and see if I can order them in longs
Because this is a regular and most Gap pants come in a long
Oh , I hope you get them
But if not , my mom will just buy some at the Gap in Houston and will let them out and then , cause they just weren't long enough
Like they were fine normally but I had bought the shoes already and so I like put the shoes on with them and they weren't long enough to go with the shoes
Oh , darn
So that wouldn't have worked
I hate it when that happens
So since you know the whole purpose of buying black shoes is for is for concerts
You know , black pants anything black I buy is for my concerts
Yeah
I wear other black , but still
That's the main purpose
So are you doing anything for carniva
Um
I have a recital to go to on Wednesday night
A friend , a violin player , Andy , is doing her violin recital , her junior recital , on Wednesday night and she's playing The Four Seasons by Vivaldi
Wow
She's playing the whole thing
So she's playing all Four Seasons
So
and she asked me to go to class last Friday and I was like "/
sure , Why no
So Wednesday night I'll be doing that
Is this at Carnegie Hal
No , it's at , um Kresge
Oh , ok
So
that'll be fun
So I won't be doing anything Carnival related then
And I'll have to go to carnival like to the midway on Thursday or Friday
Yeah
Because Saturday I have to do PYSO
Are they making you go to PYSO on Saturday even though it's carniva
Well they're not related to the school
Oh yeah
So they don't care
Yeah , I totally
I totally forgot
So yeah
I have PYSO on
and it's like three weeks till our concert , so we're getting close
I'm gonna need to come and see you at your PYSO concert
Yeah , do
It's on May first
Ok
They day before finals start
Oh great
And the day before my jury , of course
Oh man
I'm going to have a jury on Monday
Mr Thompson has already decided what I'm going to play for my recital
for my recital next year
We were talking about it today , like we got all my jury things and he was like "/
This would be a really good recital piece and we need to go ahead and start thinking about your recital music
And he's like "/
So we'll do this it'll be like the show piece , the main thing
And we'll have a couple of other shorter pieces for you to do
so I was like Ok
so he was like "/
I think you should do this , this , and this
it would be a good , like , contrast
so I was like "/
ok , sure , whatever
So I'll have to order some of that over the summer and , you know , get working on it
So you're going to be practicing for a long time
I'm always practicing
That's true
I didn't practice today cause I had a lesson
But most other days I practice
It's a musician's life
We get used to it
That's true
I am so excited , though
we get two days off of school
So am I
It's not carnival that I'm excited about so much as that we like have a three day week
The only thing I have definite plans that for carnival is the fact that I plan on getting more sleep
Yeah
than I normally do
I can always use some time to catch up on my sleep and having like three days in a row where I don't have to wake up early is going to be amazing
When do you usually have to wake u
Um
Mondays and Wednesdays I have to wake up at eight thirty so that I can take a shower before I go to class and stuff , so I don't have class until eleven thirty
Tuesday , Thursday , and Friday I have class at nine thirty so I usually take showers the night before so I get up at like my alarm is set at seven thirty , but I don't usually end up getting up until like eight fifteen
Oh , ok
So
it's closer to the time that I get up on the other days
But if I don't set my alarm for that early , I wouldn't get up that early
And then I get up at like nine fifteen on Saturdays so that I can , you know , shower and all that stuff and have time to eat before I go to PYSO
Cause I have to catch a bus like twenty five minutes before it starts to get downtown in time to warm up
Ok
and it won't get better
Yeah , well actually it will get better because once I'm like not in school anymore , most musicians don't rehearse until the afternoons
It's not usually in the mornings
Oh , so you'll get to sleep
Cause a lot of us a lot of musicians , like , they do their paid paying gigs and their concerts and stuff , they're at night
So they don't have them getting up early in the morning after they've been doing these late night gigs and stuff
So they're getting most of their rehearsals done in the afternoon
Oh , ok
And I think that's when Mr Thompson has most of his students
Every once in a while he has a morning one when they need extra rehearsals but usually they are in the afternoons
Oh , so it does get better for you
It does get better
okay
Hae Na we're going to put you in bed as soon as we're done talking
No
Yes
I'm reading
You're not gonna read
You feel like throwing up
I'm reading about the Cubans , dammit
Oh , fine
But you're not gonna , you're not gonna read while you feel like throwing up
They're all unhappy
Like you
's cause I feel like I'm gonna throw up
That's why you're gonna go to bed
oka
Cubans
No , no Cubans
Bedtime
The Cubans are uh twelve hundred miles away
And all sleeping
Yeah
They're all in bed
If we wanted to , we could just take the whole island over right now
These Cubans were exiled , I don't think they're sleeping
They're in Miami , they're also sleeping
These ones aren't in Miami
All exiled Cubans went to Miami
Oh my God , no they didn't
Well , all exiled Cubans go to bed before midnight
They're healthy
Oh my God
Wealthy and wise
Well maybe not wealthy
Cubans are wealthy
You can barely keep your eyes open
I feel like throwing up
That's why you're gonna go to bed
That's the whole point
If you feel like throwin up close your , close your eyes
And just , come on
For the love of whatever's holy in this world
The Pope died
In memory of
And what's the second part of tha
And so did Mitch Hedburg
And Terri Schiavo
Things come in threes
Oh , yeah
Terri died
We talked about that in preceptorship
About Terr
aparently we're on a first name basis with her
Well
What did ya talk abou
My US Congress did write a bill that affected her life
So yeah , I think we're all on a first name basis with 'er
Terri
What did you talk abou
Oh , how doctors felt about it
Oh
How did doctors fee
I dunno I didn't talk to any of 'em
Well
Yeah , but you said you talked about it
You said that you talked about it
We talked about what other people's doctors said about it for preceptorship
okay , well then what did they sa
I didn't talk about it with my doctor
Well , what did the other doctors sa
okay , What did the other doctors sa
Oh
The doctors that voiced an opinion
That everyone should have a living will
That's what my mother said
And that its , really an individual thing
mmm nn mmm
Stuff like that
And after seeing this happen to a lot of people , like , this case isn't like , doctors are always pulling tubes out of people
This isn't something that's different
Nope
It's just this case became like , national news
Yup
But , they're performing these procedures even at Shadyshide or Presby all the time
'n one person one kid in the group was able to sit in on it
That's pretty intense
Yeah
So
I still feel like puking
That's why you're gonna go to bed
Cubans
Yeah , well , they're all asleep
I have to talk about them tomorrow
okay , you can tell 'em that they're all asleep
Dude , it sucks to be an immigrant
what is this book that you're readin
The Vulernable Observer
It's about this girl whose parents were Cuban immigrants
And they came over , and it's about how she's toiling over whether or not to go back to Cuba
How'd they get over here , in a converted fifty three Chev
Hm
No , in a raft
I don't know
I think they flew
Oh , that's not fun
My theory on the matter is that any group of layman that can turn a fifty three Chevy into a raft that can go ninety miles deserve to stay in this country
Yeah
Like , we could use them at Ford
Or Chevy
At Ford
Oh , it hurts to laugh , I'm gonna puke
Why don't we go lie down now
oka
Gonna go time for put you to bed
No
Yes
You're not gonna to win
What're you gonna d
No , but they're unhappy
What're you gonna do , just sit here until four o'clock in the morning being unhapp
I was talking about the immigrants
I'm talking about you
Oh
Are you happ
No , I feel like I'm gonna throw up
My point exactly
That's not gonna help because I can't sleep 'cause I'm gonna throw up
I think we've got sleeping gas somewhere
Are you a dentis
Like
What i
I was gonna make a really bad joke , but I chose not to
What could you possibly make a joke of that of , hu
Ehh , it was past sleeping gas
Wha
Ehhh , don't worry about it
I dunno , we don't wanna know
No
Like gas chamber
Wha
Man you're morbid
Well , I don't know , I can't think of anything else to make a joke
You did say the joke was pretty bad
Yeah , so I went to the extreme
What was the jok
I was gonna say this is college , I'm sure we could find some roofies somewhere
Oh , roofies
Wha
No , I don't want roofies
okay ,
It'll certainly put you to sleep
Oh , dear
Wouldn't I still be experiencing whatever , but I just won't remember i
Uh , no
Oh
It'll knock ya right out
That might be nice then
Mmm , you can
I have Benadryl
That's better than a roofie
okay
It's like a little pink roofie
How do you spell roofi
Ah , roofie
Roofie
That's how they should market Benadryl
Benadryl the little pink roofie
No
You guys are awful
Guy
I didn't say that
You're the one that's sitting there going "/
I'd like a roofie
Uh well I feel like puking
If you felt like dying , you'd want a roofie too
D'you want some Pept
Maybe
I asked you that like hours ago , and you said no
Wasn't that yesterda
No , that was
I said that yesterday and today , 'cause you also felt like you were going to throw up yesterday
I'm diagnosed , it's cool
She's diagnosed , for , to suffer
Like , for Hae Na , women's suffrage takes on a whole new meaning
Wha
You never take like , things , right away to help you
You'll always be like "/
I'll wait it out
I don't believe in a drugbased society
I don't believe I should have to take a drug for every tiny little ailment
You don't have to
But there's no reason you should suffer
Oh , okay
Every tiny little ailment that makes you unable ta function
Yeah
My knee is kinda swollen
Let's see you can't
That was actually totally not what I was referring to
You can't walk , you can't read , you can't move , you're having a hard time keeping your eyes open
My migraine
It's because I feel like puking , I'm not tired
That's my point
My point is that these are not little tiny symptoms
But if you want to suffer , if you think it's dignified then go for it
That frightened me
Sorry
I don't wanna suffer
okay , then take the pills
What pill
The Pepto
Oh
Pepto's gooey
Fine , don't take it
I have the , um , chewables
Oh , that's okay , she's
Chewie
Oh , can I have chewie
You can totally have chewies
I don't like the tablets 'cause they don't work
Like , for some reason
Plus you don't wanna , swallow a pill while you're gonna die
That's true
the tablets always get stuck in my throat
Yeah
For some reason , just Pepto tablets , I dunno why
because they need to be gelcaps
Everything does
Don't touch it
I have Tylenol Flu if you guys ever need it too
I might actually take some Dayquil back with me , to sleep on
That's fine
You sleep on i
I can't tell whether
I might it might be Tylenol Flu Nighttime , if you wanna really sleep
Eh
That'll work too
I have Benadryl , or roofies
A little pink roofie
I just , I can't tell now if it's still a cold , or allergies , or both
Mmmm
Stupid pollen
Just general unhappiness
God is trying to
I learned about pollen in immunology
Mm , that's good
It's an allergen
One of the people , in the cancer study , one of the things they have to compare to cancer , well , not compare to cancer to , but one of the metaphors is allergies
Thank you
And they were talking about , y'know the how do allergies develop , bla bla bla bla bl
This person was explaining how allergies are contageous
No , it's a sensitivity
How are I know
A hypersensitivity
But they were also saying , y'know , there was another one that didn't have any sympathy for people with allergies , cause they don't have allergies , and it's really not very serious
If by contageous you mean , genetic
Y'know , allergies aren't a big deal
They just suck
And I'm like , unless it's to peanuts , and you can die
Or if it's like me and it's to everything except pennicilin
Well , yea
Well , yeah , that's also a big one
I'm like , what
I don't like allergies
I'm allergic to gold
I know you are honey
You poor , poor thing
I can on
And surgical steel , and
I can only wear eighteen carat gold oooh
I can't wear it in my ears , I can wear it everywhere else
Oooh yeah , they don't make twenty four carat gold most of the time , for anything
It's too malleable , it doesn't keep it shape
Yeah , you can squishy it
It's ductile
Yep
You can squishy i
Is that kind of like squeegeeing i
so what
Squeegee men sometimes get hurt
Squeegeeing would be this , not this
Well , the little squeegee things , well I guess you guys don't
We have squeegee men who wash your windows when you don't ask them to
And then they get mad when you don't pay them for the deed that you didn't want them to do to begin with
Yes
They're called homeless
Um , eh they have um , they have little squeegees for like , I dunno , clean out my sister's ears , cause she has hearing aids
A cloth
Like eye dropper thing
Yeah , but they're bigger
Like a little bulb
Like a turkey baster
Yeah , kind of
I hurt my own head
Like a turkey baster
My sister's just a big turkey
No , she's a little one
She's teeny
She's almost as big as her
That's still small
And she's only fourteen
I'm huge
You are not huge
I have a huge personality
That you do
You've just got a big mouth
Oooh , angry face
I'll puke on you
You've moved up from pee to puke
I got promoted
It's a different
Orefic
I was gonna say holes , but that works too
Oh my god , I think that's my cue to go home
You gone' go t'bed now , or n
I'm bleeding
I'll restate the question in case you didn't understand it the first time
You gonna go to bed now , or n
I'm gonna throw up and then go to bed
That means shortly
Well , if you go throw up , then I'll wait and we'll put you to bed
Otherwise , I'm gonna go home and put myself to bed
I need to stay up a little longer cause I don't feel good
That's not why you need to stay up a little bit longer , you wanna to read more
Let's be honest
No , I just need to sit here for a little bit
okay
I can't believe you called me a liar
Wha
He told me to be honest , that implies that I'm lying
Punk
I'm not lying
I'm not
I love how you just love to abuse me when you're not feeling good
I'm using my powers of deduction and analysis
Make me feel better you jackass
Oh , honey , you win a prize
You alright there sweethear
I'm sorry , you're not a jackass
That was funny
That was really funny
Because it was , yeah , y'know that whole grain of truth thing
A really big one
Yeah , just a little one
I don't like the Pepto_Bismol commercial
The one where they dance and do the hand motion
Yea Pepto_Bismol
Mmm
It doesn't make me want to buy it
Well , take a look at what it's supposed to help you with , and try and come up with a witty tv commercial for that

We're breaking them up into small crumb pieces
Hurraa
Stop it

She's breaking them up
H
She's breaking them
Oh , we don't want to crumple them up , Name
Cause now that's a big mess

Okay that's good
Let's see
Cold
What're we doing no
But you don't want to let the babies hold these
but we don't , not in your mouth
You don't wanna let your babies play with these
you can show them to your babies , while you're holding them
but if they get them they might put them in their mouth and that would be bad
Maybe I can put them in my
Yeah
Or you can let your mom see them and she'll show you where you can put them
Name
You you can put yours in there
Let's see
My name starts with a and b
Like tha
What's that spel

Well that is the first one
What is the second on
I had
Ai , that's my baby
Name Name
You want to do my baby xx
Well you could put your whole family in that in that bag
that can be the family bag
I need to make my mom and my dad
You need to make your mom and da
Yeah Yep
0can you open this for m
You hold one side
Argh
Ah

Frankie castle
H
A different on
Frankie tackles me
Frankie tackles yo
aw
It burns
Do you wrestle with Franki
Yeah
Do you tackle him too at hom
Yea
Come on over
here see see how I made a little robot out of the little styrofoam with the toothpick
Mmm
That's what we're doing , we're making little robots
Name made her whole family
And me
her mom , dad , Name and Sam
Me uh
Name made her whole family
You don't have to make your whole family but you can
here's one someone made
here's the body , the head , the arms and the legs
Neat
Pretty neat huh
You know what , I'm
Wha
going to try making this
I think that's a good idea
Hmm , remember if it was
today
you have what toda
A nacket
Reall
something else
now I need some tape
a caterpillar
A caterpilla
need some tape
Ado a na
need some tape
Say it agai
Nas
Need some tape
Some tape for wha
this
Well , with this project , we're only going to use the tape to put your names on the bags
how do you think you could get this to go like
how do you wanna connect i
like thi
With the ti
You think you could use a piece of styrofoam like this mayb
And stick one in there connect it like tha
What about tha
Da
Now you've got them connected
Done
You're all don
Whoah that's a lot
uhh right now , on gambit
okay
I have uh a partially populated database
well , I can show you the
Wow
Nice , you know what , this is
Exactly
this is , put it this way I like this much better just just visual the look I like this much better than what we saw the first time
this is this is really nice
This is uhhhh I mean just in terms of just a nice look a feel this is good
yeah
That's gonna hafta change
the Lt doesn't think it's professional enough looking , but you know what , for now , whatever
what , what , what has to chang
uh , the , the what's in the white spot , the actual content
Oh , okay
I agree with that and n' part of the thing to be honest with this is you can actually take out these uh take out the the the uh the uh underlining
mmhmm
uh with a style sheet and change this so it looks a little more obvious like a link
'cause right now it's gray , too , and grayed out usually means not active
yeah
So if you made this something
And what I'ld consider is I'ld consider just using regular blue
Like try to match this blue here
You know just like take use the eyedropper tool find out what that that color blue is
mmhmm
And then set in your style sheet set this to be the same color blue as up here so that it matches
And get rid of this underlining because it does look unprofessional
I and its
Sometimes what's nice is if you can set the style sheet so that when you when you when you roll over it it will it will underline
right
I know how to do that
it's just
But when it looks like this it
But , but I think this is I think this is a big improvement over what we over what you had before so I think this is a good thing
okay , what about the database
okay , so , here basically is the database
um , it's already there , on gambit
I have everything except for knowledge populated
Because knowledge is going to be a pain
Oh , so you already populated this in the s
Yes
okay
This , what's posted here some of the pages that actually use the calender and article tables
the website actually uses the calender and article tables
okay
Um yeah
Also in that packet is the structure for the site and such
okay , the okay I got it
first I was thinging vab but I see visitor , applicant , battalion
mmhmm
okay interesting way of doing permissions
Do you have a better ide
because I didn't really know how to do that
uummm , you will , a lot of times usually permissions
this is , I mean , this is one way of doing it
you know the interesting thing about doing this is um the way I would first thing I would do it is sort of a unix way of doing it which is with a number
Um and if you use one , two , and four as the numbers
so , um , a one means only visitors can do it
Two means only applicants can get it
a four means only battalion
Six two and four means applicant and battalion
Five is the visitor and battalion
visitor and applican
See what I'm saying
if you use one , if you use one , two , th , if you use one , two , four than three is visitor an , and applicant
That would be seve
mmhmm
That would probably be easier to deal with in the code
Right and so , well , tha , well , that that's how permissions are set in unix
mmhmm
Um , Although you can also set them
you know , they also , you know the uh r uh r w x but
but that ends up being numbers , too , righ
Right , it , it , really it gets converted into numbers I mean , to make it easier for some people because they don't remember the numbers
but it's really uh one , two four
Because the thing is , you know , seven means everybody has access to this , six means only , you know , two of the levels , five , only two of the levels , three only two of the levels
and so anyways , this is this would work
you know and this is fine , but I mean anyways I'm bringing unix to this
dont that's um the way to do it
but if this works then you can do this
but I'm just telling you that's the way it's often done
I haven't started using it yet , so , using the permissions yet
okay , well
I just displayed all articles for everyone at the moment
okay , that's fine , well you can think about that , that unix approach , 'cause the nice thing is , it's just numbers um and it's easier and you don't have to parse the number and just
Um , you know , trying to like you know , so um
and 'cause you can set the permission level for and what , um yeah , so , let's see
k Can I ask a question about scholarshi
Sure
Scholarship is is the list of all the
is a list of the different scholarships you can ge
But I thought
isn't there
okay I guess just I dunno
How many scholarships are ther
I thought there's just like
There's , like , seve
Seven different kind of scholarships
I think s
Yeah
reall
mmhmm
okay , like some partial support , some full support , or different branches
Things like that
okay , 'cause see I just know ROTC scholarships , so I just thought there's a /
I didn't even know there were that many until I went and lookayed and you know , got all the information from the old website
okay , that's fine
I just , I just thought well if there's one scholarship , why do we have this as a table , you know
it's just
no , no , I'm just just , yeah I just didn't know
it's my own ignorance , so um
enh , 'cause people who come into ROTC don't have scholarships in the beginning
a lot of them , so that's
Um can I ask a question on class
uh huh
tbl class , class id , you said usually three two one oh one is usually three two one oh one , mean , just , is there a code to the why you chose than number instead of like one , two , thre
They're like classes through the university
so I'm using the class id that the university uses
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , okay
okay , I understand that right now , okay
But I can't
I was thinking , I was I was thinking about class like , like the junior class in ROTC , the senior class in ROTC , okay I'm thinking of a different thing
So where are you going to use this , so where's this class table , how's this class table get used in the system
Um , it's a display of the classes that we take
currently , it's changing
like the command , or CNET , actually , or NETC , or whatever they call the education board , is changing it
So that will have to be able to be changed by the administrator for sure because it changes periodically
okay right right
okay
that's fine
but that shouldn't too hard to do that
okay , um
Staff turns over a lot , so that's gonna have to be really easy to change
knowledge changes because , uh , part of knowledge is knowing your chain of command and that changes constantly
mmhmm mmhmm
I'm scholarships /
okay °okay knowledge°
mmhmm
what kind of stuff's going in knowledg
Drill Knowledge
it's a whole smorgasbord of stuff so I have to leave it really open ended , um
okay , because I see a drill title and a drill text
Yeah
Do is does I guess what I'm wondering about is what about like an active field like if this is a drill do I have is this drill always have to appear or can this drill sometimes be taken offline , sometime be put back online ,
I mean , do I have to keep reentering , let's say I use the same drill later on , do I are am I going to delete it , am I going to reenter it
It should always be there
I don't want it to never ever dissappear
I want the amount of drill knowledge on this site to be as much as possible so I'll always be adding to it
changing a thing here or there , maybe , but since most knowledge never changes it's mostly adding new knowledge
oh oh , okay
okay , although you can edit it , righ
mmhmm , I should be able to edit it because I will have to change things like the chain of command and stuff
Well , what would happen if something he want you wanted to take something off would you could you delete i
Would it cause any problems to delete it
would you wanna delete it or do wanna still have it active deactive
I s'pose hm
I mean , you might wanna think about what on the off chance that I want to remove something
Let's say a controversy occurs I wanna just take something off real quick
I mean , you could always delete it , but then , you know , it might be easier to just deactivate it , and just have a boolean
You know , field active
it's just some /
You think I should do that for the rest of them as wel
or just that
Well , kuh article is the other one I was gonna talk about is should be , you know , display , you know , with a boolean , you know , so that way you only show the articles that you want to display
You might want to save articles , you know save past articles , or whatever , for various reasons , um , but you might want to have a display field there
It's basically boolean , the same kind of thing
display it , don't display it
You could also go to point of if somebody wanted to say don't display it until such and such a date , or display it until like a start date , end date
mmhmm
Where , what it'll do is it'll find the articles based on the start date or based on the end date
Make sens
Yeah , I was gonna do it by the timestamp and then I realized that it's probably easier and better to just
The timestamp is when they put it in , the article in righ
Right
Right
Ok
I think I need to do it where I need your permission
okay
Do you give me your permission that this might be on the interne
I do
Do you Ar
Just say
I do
You can't force someone to do it
Do you give me your permission
Just say it dammit
So anyway when I was in church , I was as Bill and I were walking into church , I was like I love being Catholic
Its so fashionable
Why are you holding it up like thi
Why can't it be natura
Why is being Catholic natura
No
Why can't
oh fashionable
Not natural
No because everyone has money , and like
That's not true
the Jews have all the money
But its really funny though because Catholics like have , its , why can't we just go to a room , not have a , like , and have a piano and a cross on the wal
Why does there have to be a marble crosses , and like
The church does have a lot of money , but thats because of the olden days
Why do , Why does that church in California have to cost a hundred million dollar
Exactly , like why can't it be a shac
Because you know religion is deep down and , whatever
So I was thinking I'm gonna do a piece where people go up to get , like , the body of Christ , like the Eucharist , righ
And that's a photograph right there , and then the camera's
There's also a camera here
After that they , they get , ahblahblahblah
After they get the Eucharist , they're gonna go and walk , but walk like a fashion runway , away
Oh , that'll be cool
But I think i its the tradition , because back in the day the church had all the money
Obviously , I mean , they still have money
That's just the tradition
I feel like the church has a lot of money
There had to be , like , the beginning of time when it was just like
Yeah , I'm sure in the beginning of time
And then they got money , and then they got money
When , When was the whole Roman Catholic revolution
Yeah when Jesus died
Today
It started today
This is when we renew our baptismal promises
Thats what I mean that like , when the church started making money wasn't when jesus died
Oh I don't know
Yeah because I'm sure then that's when it was shacks , like , Peter made the church
Roman Catholic Church didn't form until the fall of the Roman Empir
Yeah , because everyone was dumb and they couldn't read anymore
The Enlightenment was over
Yeah , Enlightenment
And that is it
Two minutes have passed
No , I need five minutes
Of this
I don't believe in it
Here , Ari
This is the check of life
I gave five dollars into the
This is the cup of blood
I gave five dollars to the church today
I felt bad
Five dollar
I wish it was , like , two thousand
There is a light
I've been singing this one song all day of my life
A church son
No , Common the light
There are times
Yeah , I haven't heard that in a long time , that song
I will be by your side
Did you finish
Thanks
How long is your
Three pages
aah
Are you putting that in your packe
Yeah
jeeezsh
Do you want to do bills tomorro
Oh no , I want to do it today
'cause then I can pay you the rent today
I hope I have enough money
You can't take it out until I have enough money
Because let's say Jeff owes me a , like a hundred fifty dollars
And let's say Erik owes me a hundred fifty dollars
And you owe me , like , thirty dollars
No , we're gonna owe you a lot of money
Yeah
Still I can write a check for you and her , rather than give her a ten thousand dollars
Yeah , like , pay my rent
But you just wrote me a check
Well , its too late now
I'll write uh two more
Uuuh
There is a light that shines , buttahfinga
Did you download that son
Yeah I'm about to play it , if there's not static

Remember to speak out so that your comments will be audible on the recording
okay , the topic that you have been asked to discuss concerns ethnic racial or gender specific organizations
Does the presence of such organizations in school promote segregatio
Do you have any other ideas for reducing segregation within the student bod
I think that of ⁎course⁎ they promote segregation , but I think I think that word in and of itself has a negative connotation
I don't like using that word self segregation as far as those kind of clubs go but their whole purpose is to create a context in which people who ⁎don't⁎ fit the status quo or the majority feel comfortable where they can go and be themselves
yeah
and talk the way they want to talk and share share an identity that they may or may not have to hide throughout the day in a in a different context
yeh
and so I I think if segregation is the word you want to call it ⁎fine⁎ but yes
they do do it and I think it's okay
I do too
because I think that and so much of your experience is based on like the ⁎whole⁎ world and like how you you know talk to everyone in the world but then if you really want to talk about your specific experience college or life or whatever if you are around people who are experienced something that's more similar similar to you I think that like talking to them about it makes it easier to understand and like makes it I just think you can relate to them a little bit better
I think segregation makes me think maybe like a negative connotation but like I mean that I agree that it's segregated but in a sense it's the way you gotta feel comfortable
in that that's what like Emily just said like if that's what you gotta do to be able to get along err to get to get to where you wanna be comfortable in life you're gonna have to find somewhere where you feel comfortable first among people that you're comfortable with and then you can take that outside of segregation
But I agree that they are healthy
I think the only negative aspect that I can think of is that when those types of groups are prevalent on your campus
inclusive err
ummm
that number one I think people view them as as a reactionary thing like oohh they couldn't fit in so they decided to make this club
and that's not I guess maybe that's not the best perception for others to have
and kind of relating to that the second thing is that if you want to bring other people into that into that group it's your responsibility then for you to reach out
like you can't you can't expect the majority whose not included in your ss quote on quote self segregated club to wanna be part of it
like after you decide to start that you know this gender group or this you know sexual preference group or this ethnic group it it then becomes your responsibility to be like okay hey you guys , you're welcome to come on come to our meetings
to get motivated
yeh which is
not segregated
kind of onesided and it kinda sucks but I guess it just comes with that's just what happens when you decide to start that kind of group
Like the BSA for example
I think a lot of people have a problem with , number one with the fact that it's , it is a black student association , well if it's black students , that means they can't come
Well no , it's just the context in which a lot of African American students are very comfortable and they talk about issues that are important to them
uhhuh
that they may not , may or may not be able to address during the day
but if you ever want anyone else to come then what do you d
Put up flyers
right
send out emails
right
blah blah blah , you know no one's ever come and you know hey , why don't you take us to BSA meeting
Umhmm
because I mean that's just I guess the exclusionary element of
segrated
yeh
yeh
It's the same thing with Foster because
yeah
I don't think that
I don't know what Foster is
Foster is forum on sexuality to encourage respect
Okay
And like I don't think that we're at the point yet like at Rhodes where we can have a group just for gay people to talk about like what it's like to be gay at Rhodes because I don't think there are enough people who are out and comfortable so the way that we make Foster like open for everyone is kind of a way of trying to get people to come in who aren't so comfortable yet being
You know just saying hi I'm gay and I'd like to be in your club
You know , but , still at the same time like we have to be open we have to invite everyone you know and I'm all for that
to make people feel comfortable
because you know if you say if you say well umm we're gonna only to let gay people in like people always say well that's just like straight people saying gay people can't come
and
right
I understand that but at the same time , there is something that is gonna separate you
and there is some uhyeh , I mean that , that , but like there is something that I can get out of talking to other gay people at Rhodes
you know
who kind of understand like or who kind of are dealing with the same stuff you know , and I'm not saying that straight peoples' or whatever peoples' opinions aren't as important as , you know , other gay people's but , you know sometimes I do just like talking to gay people about it
you kno
uhhmm
and then so it's like /
It's an opportunity for you to be able to be comfortable
Yeh
And so the question is , does that ⁎needing⁎ that to be comfortable , is that hindering your interaction with everybody els
well , no because that's who you interact with all the time
You kno
yeh
Because this is set aside specifically ⁎for⁎ that
And it's like all the other times in , you know , your daily experience you ⁎are⁎ talking to everyone you kno
and that's your time to be inclusive in you own group , like , so do you feel like it's not hindering you because that's something that you set asid
Like , I can't just walk into the into one of my classes
as an advantage not a , not a disadvantage
right
And like I can't just walk into my classroom and say "/
hey ya'll I felt discriminated against because , today because I'm gay
You kno
yeh
Not everyone will understand that
I can't just bust out into like and kind of group of people
yeh
but I can talk to them about other stuff , you know that doesn't have to do with that , you know just like regular
football
right hhh
hhh you know something everybody is can is concerned with hhh and so you know but I can in the , you know meetings that we have
Okay , well I have a question
Okay
What about groups that are not based on umm racial differences , gender differences , lifestyle differences
like sororities
Like sororitiessssss
⁎I didn't say it⁎
yehh
⁎no no no I knew⁎
but , what about
what you were talking about
yeh what about those things
Okay I don't really know exactly what my position is just because I feel like I don't know I don't feel like I have to defend it at all it's just like it seems to me I do agree that sororities are definitely different than basing it an organization on like issues or needs err , but it's also a comfort zone you know
Like the reason that you would become involved in Greek life is because you know you need to find somewhere to fit
Like I know we were talking about this the other day
and you made a really good point that like that what people do to be able to get their groups and get their cliques and get their whatever and I think that sororities are just all about a comfort zone and I don't know what that hinders
I think sororities do hinder though a lot
Like I think Greek society I don't think it's based like the way people perceive it I don't think it's very good at all because it is very exclusive
You know and it's not like "/
come join our club , we'll let you be and we want to invite you , dah dah dah dah
It's like people do get cut and people do get left out and people do get jossed around , jostled around
It's just like that's why it's different
well maybe because , maybe independents have a , and i don't want to speak for both of us , or everybody but maybe I have such , I don't want to say negative , I have a standoffish
hmmhm
umm perception of sororities just because I ⁎don't⁎ know what qualifies
I don't know
uhhuh
if I would qualify
I don't
it's like , so mysterious you know , it's I I can only base , I can only base the qualifications on physical appearance like what I see , so okay
right
so there , you know , so if you run down the list of what a sorority girl ⁎is⁎ , those are all things that I'm not
So is that why I'm not in it , or
yehhh
you see what I'm sayin
Like the eh my perception's
yehh
thrown off cause I don't know what it takes
yeh cause they don't give off a very good , because the only perception that you're getting is that they base everything on what you look like and a checklist of a b c d
yeh yeh
e f and g
so I don't know
I just I think that that it's given a negative connotation just because so many people do join it do become involved in Greek life for the wrong reasons
Because they , and like with ⁎you I see⁎ you as an independent I don't see it , like I see a lot of people as needy at first , like it , I think it gradually becomes something different but in the beginning it's , it's more of like an independence and dependence
well
and yeh and I see what you're saying because I think that a lot of it , you know when I first got to Rhodes and I thought hhh
okay hhh
when I first okay when when I first got to Rhodes I was like sororities , I can't believe anyone would join asorority , that's so stupid , that's so like , just , I mean how can you like say "/
we're , you're not cool enough to be in our club
you know , how can you judge a person like tha
And ⁎then⁎ you know going through my years I started thinking about and somebody made , pointed this out to me and said "/
how is an athletic team different than a sorority
and I started thinking about that , and I was really , I've really been thinking about it for awhile , and you know when it comesdown to it , you know you're playing sports with people who you have something in common with
hmhum
you know , like you have , we all have volleyball in common , you know , it's like that's what we do and we play volleyball and so that's how we got on this team , you know and then , and in , you know a lot of ways , the people that we spend this much time with become our friends , it's you know
right
we do make friends
because Right , right , that's how we were brought together
you know this way and I think , and we have tryouts , we cut people who aren't good enough to be on the team , you know , because they can't do anything for our
we recruit
we recruit , like because they can't , you know people who don't have the talent to keep up with the team , won't do anything for the team , so you know , we cut them
And sororities , but for something I ⁎cannot⁎ figure out what it is to me that's different in cutting someone because they're not , Because their ⁎personality⁎ isn't good enough
Yeh
You know , and I don't understand
Yeh cause it's not based on skill it's based on
But why is it different thoug
Again I I think , and this is , that I use this example as why I'm not in a sorority
Well my problem is being affiliated with a group that I cannot ⁎actively constantly⁎ contribute to
The volleyball team's good and I'm good
The volleyball team is bad and I'm bad
umhm
umhm
If we suck I suck
umhm
yeh
If we had a good game , I had a good game
umhm
I'm constantly contributing
You know even if I'm on the bench
umhm
just the fact that I'm part of the team
umhm
there's some work , some physical exertion , some emotional you know some kind of investment I'm making
It's not just the name of the team
Right
But if I'm affiliated with a group that's beyond me which I feel , I I mean I'm not sure , I neva been in somethin like that
Yeh
but it just seemed like you'd be overwhelmed by the fact that once you get initiated you are , you are that sorority
label
mhmm
and you can't and I don't I and I just don't know enough about it maybe but I you can't contribute to that
there's an institution ⁎already⁎ in place , you know , a profile already in place , perceptions already in place , and you just kind of go along
You buy the license plates , you get the umbrella , you get the tshirts , the mugs , and that's it , that's who you are
You see what I'm sayi
yeah , I think that's who you are generally though , and I mean I know we're talking generally
Cause like , Asako was like , I can't come to work on Friday , I'm like
Yea , just do it
Tomorrow I'm gonna be spending so much money cause I'm gonna be shooting
You're doing wha
Shooting , as in guns , and I don't mean my arms
Wow
I know
Do you do that ofte
No , it's my first time , with the Geeks with Guns
Ooohh
I've always wanted to try it
Wonder what kind of guns you'll shoot
I hope they're not
Oh go to
hunter guns
Oh , watch , ok , go to
I hope they're really cool like Kill Bill , no , Kill Bill didn't have guns
No
Like Pulp Fiction
Yea , but hold on dot gwg dot pgh dot com
Go to like , click on gallery or something like that , inside to your left
How much does this cos
It costs a lot of money , like it's sixty dollars , and if I want to shoot extra
These are cool guns
I know , I know
This one looks like a tommy gun , you should get that one
Get in the first one and go to that , videos
Ok , I wanna do this one
it's like , oh my gosh , it's military style
Watch the video , just look at how
Is the speaker o
It's so freakin loud
Let it load
Hi
Hi , umm my card and my roommate's card both stopped working in the door at the same time , but I emailed maintence and they said that they think that my card is messed up , so to come here and have it scanned
Okay
How about your roommate , is he gonna come by to
Uhh I could , I could tell him to umm I think it's like something wrong with the lock
Yea , that's actually possible
Yea , did they stop working like at the same tim
Yea well like , like about the same time , like , we like , our cards stopped working , and like the , and like it would light up like red , like I think it was just red
and then like , and then they came in , and like I'd sent in a maintenance request and the guy came in to fix it and then like the next day it did the same thing again , so he emailed me back and he was like , since we already fixed it I think that the problem's in your card
That's a hot wallet
Oh yea
Oh my God , is that duct tap
Yea , I lost like , I lost mine a while ago and then like I made this one while I was bored waiting to get another one , and I just decided to keep it
I kind of think I should call Adria or like go down and be like
I'll call
Just go to New Card , man
Oh , I thought you had to look up the junk
What color was the ligh
What wha
What color was the light when you
Kind of sounds like the door
Was it solid re
Yea , solid red
It's the card then
Would you show your car
Does it look oka
Yea , it doesn't look bad
looks about like mine
Once before I lost my card and I had to get a new one , and so they put on like the different
Is that the old one or the new on
It's just super odd that this stopped working
Seemed to
Ok , it'll work now
Thanks
Mm hmm
So what are you doing over Carniva
Everything
I'm gonna go out , man , just go out
Uhhuh
I just can't wait
I think I deserve it
I wonder how it's gonna be though because like unless you don't do like frat parties , like all the frats are kind of not , yea
That's why I'm not going
I'm going everywhere else
I don't know , I've only heard of like one party so far , but I know like as you go along , like more and more will come up
I'm sure like DU will have one , and Phi Kap will probably have one , but DU's in trouble
Really , for wha
Some girl passed out on their lawn or something
and DTD's gone
I think Beta's still okay
Kap_Sig , that's where I'm going
I've never been to Kap_Sign
I hear it's so much fun though
They're off campus , yes
They got kicked off , but I know where it is
It's on umm
do you know the CVS , up on
Yes
That one , it's right across the street from there
Awesome
For real
I have a friend who's really good friends with Kap_Sig guys
I'll be like
I really don't like a bunch of Kap_Sig guys , but
Reall
I have two friends in there who I love , so you know , so if they're gonna be there I might as well go
I just won't let the other people love me
I only know one from high school
He's really nice
What's his nam
Joe Phillips
I don't know , do you know Dan
Hmm mm
And , do you know Matt Martunia
Hmm mm
So those are the two people that I love in Kap_Sig
They're nuts to party with , so
and then do you think people are gonna have house partie
I don't know , I can't , like I don't mind going to the frats at all
umhmm
but my friends do , except for this one guy that I have who like loves me for it cause like I'll go with him cause it's easier for him cause he's got a girl with him
mhmm
so like we always go together , but the rest of my friends never wanna go
They do get like , they do get old really quick
Oh I know , but it's not like I go over there all the time though
Yea
Seriously I haven't been since like early October
Yea
Scratch that
I don't even , I can't remember the last time I've been there
Well I mean you can't expect much
It is gross
Yea
It's good fun once you get there
Yea
So yea , I'm gonna go all out
I got my wristband for the comedian
Uhhuh
Yea
Oh , the Ray dude , or what his name i
Ronnie Hay or Donnie Ray or something
It's the guy from Celebrity Fit Club
Yea yea yea , I know , maybe I'm , maybe I'm like totally having his name wrong
I really really wanna see the Shins
Are they coming during Carniva
That's what I thought , ok
Uhh , wristbands are coming out in April , tomorrow
But I don't think you need it cause I checked the weather and it looks pretty fine
Like I looked up the weather for the thing just to make sure
I hope it's nice cause so many more people will come
So far , it's pretty , pretty good
Good
But yea , umm , I don't want no Pittsburgh weather
Last semester I remember it was the Friday morning
I had a shift Friday morning , it was like
and , like you know , it didn't hit me til mid Carnival that I had to work tomorrow morning
I was like , crap , whatever
Was it too late by the
Oh my God , it was soo
I wasn't even hung over , I was drunk
And then like the thing is , I had two shifts that Friday
I had the morning shift , and I had classes in between , then I had the afternoon shift , but you know , there were no classes
Right , right , right
Like when I sorted out the mail , I was leaning on the wall
It was like , so funny
And then like I tried to stay awake , and finally my breaktime came before my next shift , and it was like a nice day out , and I'm like , I need some air , I need to calm down
And then I went to , and that's the only time I saw Buggy
So I was just like , I have nothing to do , all my friends are like
Yea , that's true , you would have been up
That's the only reason I didn't go was because like , I mean obviously the night before was like crazy , but I wasn't getting up that early either way
That's why you have days off
Yea , but um , so I , none of my friends were on campus
They were all passed out at home , so I was like , what am I gonna do with two hours , and I didn't feel like walking back
Right
So I just decided to stay on campus , and I just like , and I went to um , I was like , oh Buggy's on today , and a lot of people were there , and then like a lot of people watching
I watched on tv , on the Underground tv
Yea
But , cause they were playing it nonstop , yea
I really just don't care that much to like , because I don't really like , it's more like a frat sorority kind of thing , and I don't really like support or really love like any of them , so I think when I watched like Pika took everything
Aren't they really good at Bugg
Eh , I guess so , like , I mean I just went there like and it was my first time seeing Buggy ever , so I was like pretty cool I guess , you know , first time around , and it was a nice day out , so I just sat with the people beside me
I think Booth is cool though
Booth I like
I was really impressed with , I think it's Kap_Sig's from last year , the Sesame Street one
Yea
That was so impressive because it was weird because like , the day like , I hadn't been to the parking lot like for a while that whole time and I was like , and I remembered what the theme was , and I remember just walking towards the parking lot by myself , and I'm thinking , there'd better be Sesame Street on there , and it was the first thing that I see
And I'm like , that's awesome
Their Big Bird was enormous
That was really impressive
I remember I thought one was really nice
I think it , I don't think it was supposed to be Peter Pan , maybe it was , I don't know , but it had like a tire swing and like a tree or something
Yea , that was impressive too
And it had a treehouse
Yea , that was , that was really
I didn't go into that one for some reason , but I was just like , awesome
It's really fun , I like Booth better than Buggy really
I'm sure it's a pain in the ass for the people making the booth though
Oh yea
Yea , well , I was gonna say they've already started , but that actually doesn't matter because they have so much work
They've done the frames I guess
Like , I think everybody has done the frames
Yea
That's like the main thing
I guess today is like move on , to Morewood
Yesterda
Wha
Yesterday or toda
Today
Oh really , it's over in the parking lo
I don't know
Oh my gosh
It must get empty , but they start it later , they start it at like afternoon eveningish
Mm hmm
So they probably can wait til , til people are gone
I wish uh
I wish Leith would do some drafting
why don't you guys help yourselves to a fine cookie while I catch up
ah , indeed
yes yes get it out here
mmph
I'll wait
our partner's saving me from beats , nice
actually I just passed him that pack
meh I'm in but
yeah I'm doin crazy shit
what
oh
hey Sam are you getting yourself one
oh yeah
can you get me one
yeah
thanks
ooh , looks good
looks hella good

hella dud
uh , yeah
you guys are gonna have to share this plate
all right
sweet thank you
hah ok it won't be the first thing we've shared
Sam's tender hole
I don't get at what you mean
scary talk
not a word
George you always ruin the fun
the funk
oh
I'm gonna use this as a napkin
just the corner though
it's not ok
Drew's like property rights excuse me
uh hey that's mine
I take a card from the pack then I pass it to my right black
tough crowd in here
these are good
yeah
yeah nice job
what
oh that was to uh Sam
you just wanted to ask for
whatever
ooh , that's a good idea
all right
sweet
sweet everybody gimme some
yum
hmm , who got all these greasy spots all over the cards
that's been
is there any question
it wasn't Rod
everyone except me
oh yeah
Sam , you might
I'm not culpable , these cookies are gulpable
I was wiping my hands on my pants after every
dick
mmm are really good
allow me to demonstrate
oh wait
nice
nice nice
here's my secret move
somehow this recording device encourages
ooh , I almost got punched
I didn't realize that you had em I should've just laid em' down gone bam
aw dude
they're like wow goin like well it's a macro so if you recorded for all time , posterity
I know but I had trouble making your and hitting you
I had a bit of a little mad I think
only mad at yourself
shut up
whoah
bam crash slam bang
God , this card taunts me
taunt taunt
you guys watch the Simpsons last night
no
for some reason the people of Shelbyville hoot
like monkeys
like what I was just doing
yes
I'm gonna break this card
I dare you to break it
actually you can do that actually can rip a card
yeah right
uh huh
remember Osep did that
oh yeah
that guy who hated on him
ahh
what card did you rip
fuckin in the butt with the shit
what the fuck
I can never use this
no
oh no
I wouldn't even do anything about it
well no it was tainted it was sorely tainted already
you never said we couldn't curse , you just said don't say anything sensitive
no
shhh
uh
I mean it's totally fine , like , I just kinda wanted to use this as like a practice session
oh right
oh of course
at the least it's an example of vulgar language usage
oh
sounded like it hurts
damn , this is kind of bonkers
whoah
so what's the deal like that with team drafting like that you don't want certain things to get into other people's hands i dunno
hmm
I uhh I dunno
you need to know what the other people are in for that to work
yeah
yeah it's really hard to judge
hmm
I mean the priority is always getting the quality in your hand
now we know what crazy tricks people will be throwing
works for me
oh God
yeah this is a bit nutty
Christ
ok
God damn it
that's ridiculous
these packs are always so stupid
the Betrayers is weird could be a real toss up , you know
yeah
go either way
ooh shit
what
does that mean another batch is done
no , that was just the five minute warning
off who's in that five color deck
heh't's like ha ha
passing
yah
damn
rough roughy rough
George , d'you mind if I read that
I feel like in some ways it would almost be easier to do a draft if you got to open the Betrayers first
yeah
well that's a big part of it I think is trying to set yourself up for Betrayers pack , you know
could I see that plate , Drew
what
what
I haven't had a cookie yet
dammit
thawas nice to ask for the plate
yeah
yeah
I thought about it for a long time
yeah I almost did it to be safe
you might've , y'know , if you did ask him , I bet it would've been better if you said you should put that plate over here
yeah
I dunno Drew responded to command , but like sounded like there was something wrong with it being there he might be like oh
I dunno but
yeah
I could've gone like , whoah you should put that plate over here
kicked it under the table
or like
if you were just to be like , hey Drew gimme that plate
so you guys both think it would've been better to just say than ask
yeah
cuz I think ask considers that you might be doing something for them
this isn't the last cookie , is it
no
no
no there's a whole nother batch
we're just discussing the
how to bend others to our will
yeah
it would prolly be even better to do it while like when he's just picked up a new pack and he's really interested in what cards are there
right
mm hmm
that's true
this is fucking craziness
love that guy
you're gonna put that finger on the cards now right
well I got a napkin
huh ok
just checking to see
Rod san
what
yeah I'm not passing this to 'im , sorry
oh never mind , sorry
yeah ,
doing a quick little check
I guess you're just all slow
oh
oh
ooh , got us there
Okay
so um
There's like other stuff that like , Kushtrim , like said
Oh ye
Last night
But
Um
Like
I don't know
he's the strangest guy , like , he was like , he was like , um "/
I don't know why but I feel I might be attracted to older women
Oh Reall
Yea , and I was like "/
Okay , um , I'm sorry to hear tha
I mean like
Like , I don't know but um
Are you older than hi
No
But
he doesn't really like , was , I , he's so strange , because like , he acts like he was like attracted , obviously , to me
Right
And then , he'll say , he'll be like , like "/
That woman over there , she must like , she's probably as old as my mother , but I can't help it , i'm attracted to her
Out of nowhere , he just says tha
Yeah
Wow
And I was like , "/
Why don't you just go up to he
And then he's like "/
No no no , that would be rude for you
If you had two other friends , then maybe like I would say , excuse me , I need to go , And ugh I don't know
huh , where's he from agai
Kosovo
Maybe things are different there
A little bit , haha
yea you know he comes across kind of normal too the first time
Kind of norma
Well , the first time I met him , he was like normal
No , I think , so like , I don't know where it comes from , because like
he acts like
he acts very like
He acts very respectable in front of other people and like
I feel like
Do I just bring out the worst of people or somethin
No , It's just that like
With all the stuff that he's saying , there's no way you could bring that out
haha , I don't know , it's just , uh I guess it's just the way he is , It just doesn't come out that way unless he's around certain people
I mean like , Zander like
Oh yeah
Naw , but I mean , you didn't bring that out
That's very hard , it was already there
maybe it's just
Maybe it's a European thing
Well , where's Zander , where's zander fro
Well , from America
But he was in Europe so he gets
Yea , hehehe
Oh ok
Somehow , by like diffusion
Daha
I don't know if that's how it works , but yea , I , I think that they are similar in a lot of ways
mmhmm
yea
I think that they're similar and that /
why
and you should stop hanging out with them
I don't think so , no , but
hhmhhmm
You can't just cut off a tie with a person like that , I mean
When's the last time you talked to zande
Okay , that's a different scenario
yea
Well , that was very much a mutual thing , like , if this was with like , Kustrim , I would be like , go
I just don't like , uh , like what he's trying to do
I question like his , intentions
His motives
Cause like , is he really your friend , or is he trying to get in your pant
I just uh , it just seems , a little odd
I mean , most friends don't act like that
Maybe Kushtrim doesn't know how to be friends to a girl
mmnnn
But like , what am I supposed to do with tha
Like , you can't just be like "/
You don't know how to be a friend
I can't
yea , well , maybe when he says something , that's inappropriate for friends to say to one another , like , uh "/
I want to sleep with you
or "/
are you good in be
or something like that , then I'd say it's uh , you know , it seems like that you should , stop him and tell him "/
Kushtrim , that's not something one friend would say to another friend
Maybe not like that , but something similar
I don't think friends should , mnnnmnhhh
He's just uh , I'd say comes off as a different guy , than he actually is
Well , that's cuz you're a guy
That's true
So when he met you , he treats you like he probably would treat friends
How many times have you hung out with him when it was just like you guy
You and Kushtrim
Like this semeste
No , till now
I don't know
Fou
Not a lot
More than fiv
I would say about five
About fiv
Okay
But then , I think there's been an equal amount where I , I spent with him and with like Sure_Thing , or him and Cori , and somebody else , or like , him and just a couple other people kind of thing
Ok
Well , when you guys are alone , has it always been wierd , or have you ever felt like
that time he tried to kiss you , that count as on
No , it doesn't actually
Okay
Are you okay about tha
I didn't say anything
Well , if that's when it was wierd then
No I don't , I didn't feel
I feel like since I came back from Spain , like , it's become like full force , like
mmm
Like , do you know , the first thing that Kushtrim said to me , was , um , well , obviously like , hi and like all that , but like the first like ligitimate comment he gave me was like , like "/
Europe's made me , like , like so much more beautiful
or something like that , like since I came back
hmmm
and I was like , oh , thanks Kushtrim , I missed you
But , it was still awkward
It's better than taking that approach he took last night
to get in your pants
Well , he did have a girlfriend , didn't h
Yea , maybe that's why it helped to keep him full
because he had her to focus on
I think that he needs someone
He claims he doesn't though
Yea , well , nobody's going to claim that they need someone
Why would want to need someone
I think he would say
That you need someon
Yea
Kushtrim , yea , he would be like "/
Man , I'm craving someone
like
i mean , I know he's up front , but that's kinda like
a knock against his like , I don't know , his manhood , like his individuality , like
he needs someone , like he's like , he needs to be dependent on someone
he feels alone and he can't handle himself , he has to have a gir
I mean , i don't know what a relationship does to him so
I'm uncertain , although it really might really help him out , i mean , there's all kinds of people
That's it , how long had he been going out with he
I think it was a couple months , i'm sure
Is that longer than you picture
Wha
Shorter than you would think , or Longe
What do you think with Kushtri
Well , like , Kushtrim talks a lot about , like , marriage , and stuff , like he feels like he's at the age that he's seeking marriage
So , I've told you about this stuff , righ
Yea , I think so
Briefly
How old is h
I think twenty four
Uh huh
And like I understand where he's coming from , but I don't know
What do you fee
Like maybe he feels that his clock's ticking
Yea
He needs to find someone
Spread the seed , like evolutionary psych
Oh God
Oh Crap
the way
I do think , were are trying to figure out , the main reason I do think he did really rape her I don't feel like there is any legit reason she would make a statement like that
I don't see anything in it for her that's the only thing
I mean don't most strippers want attention
wouldn't be a stripper if you didn't want attention
Supposedly stripers have low self esteem so yes they do want attention
I know but , that's , you can't say , there are those who they don't have a high education and they have to strip to
like eat , you know what I'm saying that could be a very possibility
she does not necessarily want attention
She is not going to get money , these kids in college
he necessarily didn't rape her
Wha
You are saying necessary
the thing is like even though , even thought there's nothing in it for her , some people get accused of things their faults for no reason
Just cu
like maybe , maybe the guy pissed her off , maybe the guy didn't tip her enough ya know , maybe that's why she decided to make a big deal of it
maybe he offended her maybe he called her a whore or something
that's the thing though
that's considered sexual harassment he could get arrested for that
well then , well maybe , like ya know this girl without a college education supposedly doesn't know this and thought that she was raped
well that's true , it's possible I dunno
You think people should get uh sexually uh charged get sexually charged sexual harassment for saying a name like that
I mean , I dunno just like I don't get offended when some says that doesn't like mean that whatever
not like whatever I mean I'd get offend but like but just because I wouldn't get offended
Yeah there is like paint all over me
what were you paintin
I was painting some plywood
You should help paint the fence tonight
I told Dorian that you guys should do a little tridelt shout out but he was like no
Tri delt shout ou
what are we gunna sa
we love tri del
would you guys shout out Pik
We would do a , we would do a Pika shout out
you would do a Pika shout ou
Yeah
are you going to do a Pika shout ou
if we get the fence , who is getting the fence
maybe we'll hand it off to you
We can hand it off to whoever we want
We can hand it off to you
We have a lot of power right now , fence power
So anyway Back to Duke , Back to Duke hum do you kno
has been criminally charge
has he been arraigne
Uhmmm
I don't think so
don't think he's been
I mean he probably gunna end up in court
I mean , it just , it doesn't , I don't , I'm pretty sure he hasn't been criminally charged it kinda confuses me
That's the thing thought , they can't cater to the
I mean he would probably have to agree to get kicked out of school , like if that was like for his safety it the only way
you can just kick someone out of school
That's why , that's how , that's why for that party I sue the person who
I mean if I got accused of that yeah I would probably leave school too cuz I wouldn't want anybody hurting me
But I dunno
There are people out there who want to kill him
to kill the kid it's just not safe for him
yeah A lot of feminists want to kill him
But , so like , I dunno
If he is innocent why doesn't he go to cour
why has he gone to court if he has been criminally charge
I am saying since he hasn't been criminally changed
Why are you talking about the Duke Thin
you know we are being taped
Well I wasn't sure I thought you guys were just
Why are you taping thi
kayhan
kayhan- It's for a class , language and thought
kayhan has a project kayhan
we record a conversation for studying language and uh kayhan- Transcribing the conversation
So yeah so we were
We are talking about the duke thing , that's the topic of the conversation
you have to talk about it for forty minutes
Thirty minutes , we are almost done , cuz we already had a conversation before this
plus it's an interesting topic
Like
I dunno you think that a girl , do you think that the girl will file civil charges in hopes of you know mone
I mean , it's pretty crazy
Cuz he can be tried both ways , he can tried criminally and civilly
But I don't think he has been criminally charged which , I think that if not criminally charged winning a civil case is more difficult because the judge of the civil case is gunna wonder why he hasn't been criminally charged as far as there isn't enough evidence to criminally prove him guilty so what makes him feel like he has enough evidence to civilly prove him guilty
so I don't he his gunna end up having to really pay anything for this
So what happens in , in cases like this , like when its just guys word against a girls but there is like no witnesses and no evidence
I mean
I'm not sure if there are witnesses or not , there were other guys that were involved
it says here there is actually
They took DNA tests from the girl they don't have results yet , but the duke lacrosse attorney actually stepped up , and it says that they uh , represents team co captain , the women fabricated her story and has gotten in over her head with the story she is telling
like that's the word of a lawyer , I mean
he has to say that he is in the defense of the duke dude
well they say that the there is photos that show the women attempting to reenter the house with a big smile on her face
I mean , But how do they know that , how is she attempting to renter the house , how is that not the same time
I think , I think that , you can get raped and still try and enter a house with a smile on your face , like , I've been raped before
Really
and I'm alright , yeah , see the thing is like a women gets raped they finally goes in shock for a while , I dunno it just depends
It's different with tragic experiences so I don't think entering a house is evidence of her not getting raped
that's true
She doesn't have much credibility , I mean she , and she has just because there is like probably not very well educated
Being not educated makes you not credibl
I mean a court of law yeah
like I mean I am not saying its right
but the jury is not really take , like if she had a PHD
This actually they actually say that she said , she said she was subjected to racial slurs by three men she was dragged into a bathroom raped multiple times beat choked her
That's what she sai
That's what the twenty seven old , oh student at near by north Carolina century university
So she is a college student
She is a stripper
Ok
So I mean but that's another thing three guys on the lacrosse team and those three guys did it and that's what they are saying
that's what she is saying
Right
the whole team is getting suspended
so if they are denying it they are going to have those three denying it , so I mean
there is actually attorney involved and there is criminal charges
So I dunno
its gunna be tough , the DNA test it gunna really
Sometimes you rely on DNA but then they are gunna , If it comes back when they find DNA on her , He can always say it's consensual
they are also being charged for its says uhh
but he hasn't yet said its is consensua
I don't , I don't really know what he said
if he said it was conceptual or if he said it was consensual
I am not sure of that
do you know tha
if he claimed
I don't if he talked yet
I don't think he said anything yet but hush they also said that uh two black women outside that they were screaming racial slurs at her
that's another they are getting charged for
Yeah two women were
so like I dunno were they like I dunno did they say so it doesn't hold up in court
yeah
I'm sure his lawyer is advising not to speak just because wait for DNA tests cuz if he really wants to get off for this he is gunna have like , if it comes up with his DNA on her he is gunna have to say its consensual so like I dunno
He knows he knows
So , do you like California in genera
I don't know , it would have been better without the whole driving to San Francisco and back because the road was , like this , really curvy , and I couldn't take it , I , needed to be sick the whole time
Did you actually thoug
No , but I was close , the whole time , so it was unpleasant
Ok , and then , then you got to San Francisco and , you hung ou
Uh huh , with that Katya girl , and , then one day , she didn't go anywhere with us , but one day we took her grandma's friend Mila , who was visiting from Russia , to some park downtown or something , and we walked around the little fake duck pond and stuff
I don't know , I guess it was interesting for her , but we'd already seen all the pretty hikes so we were like ehh , this is nice
I see , And then , so , then you drove bac
Then we drove back , on one day
It was , long
And then we got back , and oh oh oh , ok , Mom got a hotel on priceline , and it was supposed to be some very nice hotel , she got it really cheap , but we were afraid that they'd only have one bed in the room
But we got there , there was two beds , everything was really nice , and Mom walks into the hotel in her dirty sneakers , and jeans , and not washed , from , like , hiking
And it's this really nice hotel and everyone was looking at her really really weirdly
And , so , we checked in and whatever , and we get in there , and the room was so nice , it was ridiculous
When I went to New York , also , for my interview , also , they all looked at me like 'what the hell are you doing here'
A bunch of like , official business people with their official business things , and then some schmucky teenager
I walked in at night , you know , late
Yeah , that's what we did too
But it's nice , when you get to stay at a nice hotel
Yeah , except , I don't know , it was decorated , I supposed it was supposed to be fashionable , or whatever , but to me it was just really ugly
like lots of bright colors that clashed
Maybe it's just left over from the eighties
Maybe
No , the hotel where I was , it was really nice , and they had really good breakfast , cause it was all official business people , you know , on Wall Street , and they had everything you want , made to order , you could tell them what you want in your omelet , and they had every kind of food , fruit , pastries , whatever
Our breakfast wasn't included , and it was twelve dollars , so we were like no
That's typical our style , see it's nice when the company paid for me
That's nice
I was like yeah , whatever
And then the hotel made a mistake and charged my credit card for it , instead of Merrill Lynch's , and I was like Jesus Christ , three hundred fifty one dollars for one night in a hotel , aaah
So I called them and I'm like guys , guys , this is not normal and they fixed it
That'd be hilarious
Yeah , I was getting a little nervous
What was I going to sa
Um , no , the hotel
My favorite part I think , was , there was this little rubix cube in the room , and there was a little card that said "/
do you think you can make this rubix cube
If you can , bring it down to the bar and the bartender will give you a free drink
Or , you can take it home , and we'll just add fifteen dollars to your room bill
And I was like , that's a lot for a rubix cube
Yeah
It was really random , too
So did you make it , and get a free drin
You should have
Mom was really tempted to
Mom was looking at it , and she was like "/
hmmm
You should have made it , and gotten one of them a free drink
You know there are people who actually have formula
Like Bor has this really nerdy friend who knows how to make it
He's like , ok , so then I turn it one half turn to the right , and then I turn this other part
He has this whole , like , formula , and he can make any rubix cube behind his back at any time
We're not cool enough for that , we couldn't figure it out
Yeah , that's pretty cool , let me tell ya
Uh huh
Um , Yeah
What else happene
Oh , the Bat Mitzvah
The Bat Mitzvah was probably the best one I've ever been to
Wh
Minus the fact that I didn't really have anyone I knew there
Cause she's cool , and then most of her friends are cool
Except for some who are kind of annoying , but whatever
And then , the music was the best I've ever heard at any Bar_Bat_Mitzvah whatever
Cause usually they play rap , and I don't like rap
But they played two Beatles songs , and they played just in general , stuff that I liked mostly
And then there was , like , requests , and
Well , you can tell them , like , what you want them to play
So maybe your friends just tell them to play rap
Probably , but I don't know
So did you request anythin
Um , I asked if they had anything by Beck , because I'd showed Rebecca , the Bat Mitzvah girl , Beck , and she wanted to hear some more , and they didn't have anything
They only had popular stuff , or stuff that's been around , like Build me up buttercup
I see , So you had fun , did mom and dad get drun
Not really , surprisingly not
Because we had to go on a plane right after that , so
Right after tha
In the evening you went right on the plan
We left the Bat Mitzvah , Oh , wait
One of her friends obviously wanted her
But she was denying it
It was really funny
He was like this little chubby kid , and he was really nice , I liked him
But he was kind of antisocial , and refused to dance , and just hung out with her the whole time
And they obviously wanted each other
They wanted each other , or he just wanted he
I dunno , she seemed to like him a lot like as friends , but I dunno
Friend zone
Yeah , but it was cute
It was funny
Me and all her friends decided that it needed to happen
So you made friends with her friends , to
Some of them , yeah
It was interesting
I was like guys , I'm gonna dance , 'cause I'm not gonna ever see any of you again
because I don't normally dance
That's awesome
Cause that's when you have a good time , you know
Exactly
I'm not gonna see them in California ever again
Yeah
So why not
And then , um , then right after the Bat Mitzvah , we went to the airport
But before we got there , there was ridiculous traffic
It took us like , three hours , instead of like one , so it was kind of bad we were afraid we were going to be late
But then we found the rental car and returned everything , and we were like barely there
But then we had a little time , so me and mom were like , you know what , we're hungry
Let's go get some food
So we went , and there was really nothing besides McDonalds , and so we got those nasty chicken sandwiches , aand the plane ride after that , I like could not live , I felt so bad
Wait , why , because it was turbulence
Well , there was turbulence , but , just in general , McDonalds always makes me sick
Plus turbulence , equals bad
And there was a baby right next to us , and it was loud
But the first
Wait , how long is the fligh
No no no , the first flight was only an hour , so I
To wher
To Las Vegas
So I lived through it , but then we walked through the airport , and it was smoke , and it reminded me of last time we went to Las Vegas when I had the stomach flu and I felt awful the whole time
But whatever , then we got on the plane
I 'member , every time we went into a casino , mom would be like let's go look at this beautiful casino
and you would be like bleh
Yeah , and then , um , we got on the plane , on the way there , we had to do some underground tram , and it was complicated , and on this tram there was this lady , and she had two cats in like , bags , and we were like ok , and then we get on the plane , and this same lady goes right behind us with her cats
And they meow
Yeah , the whole time
The cat was under my seat , and I couldn't take it , I felt so bad for it
It was meowing like someone was killing it the whole time
Poor furry
I know
How can you do that to a ca
It was a four hour flight
Well , if it has to get somewhere , maybe she's going somewhere , you kno
Maybe , but I felt soo bad for it , and I like , couldn't sleep cause the cat , and this was like three o'clock in morning , and the cat's under me , meowing
It was really depressing
Plus , I felt really sick still , cause there was lots of turbulence , so it was just not a good plane ride back , at all
Well , then you got home and you went to bed , and now mom and dad have to drive me back to Pittsburgh
Exactly
I wanted to take the car , but they would not let me
I know , I'm sorry
I tasted the freedom of having a car in Pittsburgh
I was the one who accidentally gave them the idea that the Nissan would get there , and maybe drive around , and then it'd die
Damnit
Sorry
Ok , it's going to die eventually anyway
I know
I was excited , it was really fun to have a car , cause I could drive places , and enjoy life
That's generally what you do with a car , drive places
So my friend's coming to- um on Thursday
To for carniva
I told you righ
Yeah
um , Alex
Wait , this Thursday , next Thursda
next Thursday during carnival
yeah
And I'm really excited because I haven't seen him
I'm , so , I met him in the summer , righ
This summe
no
Or like the summer befor
The summer before my senior year
So I haven't seen him since then
so
and he's your best frien
No , well , he's one of my best guy friends because I went to an all girls school
that's true
you know
and we talked to each other online and stuff , like he'd call me
He wanted to come visit me in DC
But like that didn't really work out
And my parents and stuff , like I don't know , they were like , against males or something
Right
Yeah , but , yeah , so I'm really excited to see him , I haven't seen him in almost two years
Oh wow
Isn't that crazy , yeah , so I met him
So you said he is still in high school , righ
He's a junior yeah
So how is he coming her
Oh , his dad
Oh , okay
Like he wants to visit this school because he is pretty interested in CMU
That's why you should stay here
I don't know how that's going to work out
But he lives in Michigan , yeah , isn't it really strang
aren't you fro
I know , I'm from Northern Virginia
I live near DC , and um so the summer program was at this private school called Cidwell
and there was , there was just like just a ton of classes you could take , and I think I was taking some study skills something while taking
How did that work out for yo
in the long run
It was so stupid , I didn't learn anything
And how are your study skills no
Very very bad , as you can tell , I procrastinate to the max
So do I , as you can tell
Time management skills , they don't exist , anyway
Basically the study skills class was so dumb , there was like three kids in it
and um , but I was doing that because well in the morning , but then I would have SAT class
In the afternoon , because I took the SATS again in probably November of my senior year
He was taking some writing classes and stuff , apparently his aunt , his okay , I remember
His aunt lived like near DC
Okay , so he was visitin
Well , he stayed there for the whole summer for the summer program
Like he comes to DC a lot , last summer he went to this like this precollege thing precollege program at Georgetown
He loved it , he actually lived in like Georgetown dorms and stuff
and uh yeah , but he is from Michigan , his brother and sister I think go to U_Mich
you kno
yeah , University of Michiga
I don't think he wants to go there , and like this kid
So he wants to come her
I think , well he is looking at it
He's a really smart kid , he goes to a Catholic all_boys school
So he's like the male version of yo
Not really , he's not as crazy as me
I'm sure he's not that crazy , he's like and it's so funny because he's Korean , right but all
He told me he has like maximum four asian friends
Like he's a super twinkie , he's even more of a twinkie than me , pretty hard to believe righ
Does he speak Korea
I don't think his Korean is that great
Like I think he knows some Korean , but he's like amazing at , he's amazing at guitar , he plays electric guitar by ear
Can he read music
I think so too
I think he can general like yeah , tabs and stuff
I think he can actually read some music , cause he plays a lot of instruments
Let's see , what else , he sort of tried to start a band , but it didn't really work out but
Like he he sends me his music , he loves The Strokes , so he plays
I don't know who they
aw , man , they are an awesome band , like sort of modern day rock
You know how many English bands I know
Yeah , you really don't listen to English music
I have some
Yeah , I know , but anyway , but he listens to yeah , The Strokes and he
Actually , like he uses this program on his computer where he does drums and he also does , you know , his own electric guitar , and puts it together , makes the song together
It's all him , like it's amazing
Does he play anything else or just guita
Guitar and drums
He has a drumset , I think he plays from keyboard and what not
Like piano and stuff like that , like he's so musical
Kinda like Dere
kinda like Derek , but he's so different that you know , like , I don't know
Derek is from Hong Kong , and he's very sarcastic
Alex can be sarcastic but , I don't know
Wait , why do you think it's weird that I haven't seen him for two years and he's my best frien
That is kinda weird , hu
yes , it is
No , but we talk on AIM all the time , like we call each other sometimes
It's because I don't have that many like guy friends , righ
I went to an all girls school
You do here though , don't yo
here I do
But close guy friend
I don't have that many , I think
Like , how man
Most of my friends here that are really close to me are girls
They are the girls on my floor , the girls from ARCC
Yeah , like , I'm not best friends with Bo or like
Well , you don't like Bo
I know
I know , but like I try to be nice to him
well what about Eri
we're not best friends , no way
well , but you're pretty close , aren't yo
I don't think we are that close , he's kind of guarded so I don't know that much about him
Yeah , he is
Like we are pretty good friends I'd say
But I used to be really good friends with Leon
Then we had like a falling out
You probably don't him , he's a freshman , bio major
From like Boston area
Nope
Yeah , we spent way too much time together
I thought he was a nice guy , until I got to know him
He became very very annoying and super anal about grades and we had a stupid fight about it
We had a falling out basically , and I don't really talk to him
You don't really see him anymor
He's in my chem class , that's about it this semester , but I really don't talk to him anymore
But then I started hanging out with Eric Teng a lot
Do you know Eric Ten
Okay
He's the IM coordinator for ASA
He's also a freshman chem major
I don't really know that many ASA people
It's so funny how I know him , because I did meet him during orientation but the thing is that
We found out that one of my Korean friends from Madiera used to go out with him
How crazy is that , and she is a sophomore , she's like twenty
He's like eighteen , but anyway , the thing is /
Like Theresa and Bo
The funny thing is , she didn't know , like , she didn't even know he was
Oh reall
Like Theresa and Bo
At least they know how old they are though
she kinda went out with him for like , it was like a very short fling and basically , no offense to him , but she kinda used him to get back with this other guy
yeah , Ricardo , so
Ricardo
Ricardo , you don't know him
there is no Ricardo here
oh , no no , no no no they met each other at Brown precollege
oh , at
At like Brown University , and um yeah , so they had some drama
But yeah , she's a sophomore here actually
It's so funny
But yeah , her exboyfriend is a freshman here too
Yeah , but now like I don't really see him anymore and like he got annoying too , I don't know what it is
Maybe I get sick of people easily
Am I annoyin
No
I usually don't get sick of people that easily , but I guess I get , you know I get bored fast , I have like ADD
You have a short attention span
That's true but when it comes to close friends you know , usually I keep them you know close to me
but there's just something
I think I am finding more and more the closer I get to these guys , the more annoying they become
Or I find their true personality or I really get to know them and they become really annoying or something
That's true of most people , like when I first met Andy I thought he was a really nice guy and everything
Now , I still think he is a good guy but every so often , like with Ruby
Like Eric , I still think he is a nice guy he just gets annoying , because he's kind of like Chang , he talks a lot
About nothingness , literal nothingness
and and like recently , he's been , like apparently he's a brother of A_K_P_s_i
and then so he's really secretive about it , even though I can see the pin that he is wearing all the time
and he he just tends to be very secretive about things now , it's very strange to me
I never saw him as a super secretive person , he's the one who has all the korean drama
He has it on his computer , and he'd show me My Sassy Girl and we'd watch it
Another guy that watched Korean Drama
Yeah
He watches Chinese , Korean Drama , everything
Japanese too maybe , the girl from sixth floor , and him , and me , we'd all watch movies together
but now , well , maybe it's just like we all don't have time anymore but still
like like I used to eat lunch with him all the time , and like it's just weird now
It's not weird , we are still friends , but he became very secretive and kind of annoying in that sense
like because , t's annoying that he doesn't tell me things , or he'll be a compulsive liar , I can't stand it anymore
I don't know what's wrong with me
Why do you think it's something wrong with you
No , what's wrong with me
Like not havin
Not having close guy friends , no I mean , for example , Alex is a guy , I really consider him one of my closest guy friends
Wh
Alex
Oh your friend
For a second I thought you meant Alex , Alan's roommate
Next Thursday , Alex is coming
But the thing is , I haven't seen him in two years
How are you with the other ARCC board guys , like Bosco , Alan
We're not close , we're not that close that's the thing , we are just friends
I don't consider us really close friends
So like Hakeem right
Wh
Oh , you don't know him
Sorry you don't know him , I met him the summer after eighth grade
I met him the summer after eighth grade at , have you heard of John Hopkins CTY progra
Center for Talented Youth
Center for Talented Youth , It's sort of a nerd summer program
I went to that at a college in Maryland
I met Hakeem , we've been friends since then , he's one of the few people I kept in contact with
From summer , he's also one of my best guy friends
He's a freshman at Dartmouth
Really really smart , but in high school he'd come over to see my place and stuff , well I wasn't in the place but my friends were
Yeah , we'd just see the place together
I'll eat , but I ate at like two
Oh no , you need to eat or else you can't really eat til nine
This is salmon , it doesn't take much room
okay
Who was that , What was tha
Was that you burping
The tape moved
we're on burp patrol
I'm glad you think that I'm so gross
You have to though , with these two
That's the truth
They think it's so amusing
Look at what my body can do
I don't burp
I'm so proper
I wasn't expecting it
There's another , whoo
I don't do that
Maggie's the best one
Maggie does this , I rarely burp
She was doing it all over , I rarely do that
and she did it like six more times
but you guys shouldn't make fun of me because I rarely make gross noises
we were in a tent too
yes , we were in a tent too
and it was raining so we had all the little air holes zipped up too
Oh here's the um , this is the comme , this is the um , this is the comic strip that I was talking about , that you asked about
are you going to school tomorro
I was doing all my calc homework but I then I couldn't understand it
We don't have math tomorrow , do w
No
We should bring a pie for Pi day
She sent us an email saying that
Y'all should bring like a pecan pie , I'll make you a pecan pie
Fritz brought a pecan pie last year
Fritz is really good at cooking
So y'all should marry Fritz because he can cook and he has a house in Cape Cod
Tiffany we should both marry Fritz and then he can cook for us
His dad makes a lot of money
Yeah , his dad is really rich too , we'll wait till he gets really old and then we can marry him
You're way too
Why do I have to be really ol
He has to be really old
But , wh
Well I guess if he's really old , you're really old too
Why don't you just , just decide he's ok young
He's really cool
Ok , then you oughtta go out with him cuz he has a house at Cape Cod , a second house , and
But I don't want to , cuz I don't understand anything he says
Yeah , he's really weird
you don't have to do anything , just laugh , you're good at it
That's all you have to do is , Oh he talked about the really weird stuff , hehe
But he's
Tiffany , what are you doing to my doug
I don't know , don't you make it like thi
Yeah , but not like that , You don't just start randomly pulling on them
Like , hmm how does this wor
Look , I've seen them unroll
Tiffany , go get your hair cut
I've got to go look at this hair cut that's so amazing
It's really not , it's just , because , because
It's ok
I would've laughed at it too , but I had to wait until Tiffany got home
Wh
I think that I'm gonna move
No , it's because Tyler got his hair cut and it was
It looked the same
really bad
No it wasn't
I just made that up , I don't know
Mom , you're takin' some abuse
Tiffany started it
Guess what thoug
I can issue some abuse too if they don't stop
Nothing
You know , I'm going to seem so normal when y'all go to that SAT class and see that guy
And he has the same hair cut too
He's got the same hair cu
Yes
He doesn't
We'll see
That's such a mean thing to say
So what you're saying is , I shouldn't go and have my hair cut by a woman whose hair is only an inch long everywhere
Yes
Everything's hard
I can't keep from laughing
It's ok , I'll live
It's ok when your hair gets rolled it'll look nicer
Enough hair dissing , ok
It's ok once you , once you get it changed it'll look a little bit better
Yeah , as soon
Once you fix it
as it like grows out and go to someone else and have it fixed
Once you get your next
Actually it's not
It can't be any worse than when I was engaged and went to get my hair permed so it would look all cute and they fried it off at my scalp
And then had to cut my really really long beautiful layered hair to what was really really short and then some of the stubby part like took years to grow out
I mean really everytime where the rod touched my head it fried it off and it was like less than , it was not measureable , you had to have calibers to measure it
It was awful
Did you really measure it with caliber
I didn't own any calibers but I knew that that's what it took
Just wondering how you knew that because I don't think I would've been
But I've used them so I'm aware of their abilities
Of the abilitie
Kent
Yes
Could you do somethin' that will shift the focu
To you or somethin
I could burp
We'll pass on that
People in school burp a lot , I mean like , like to burp loud
Yeah
What did you sa
She said some people at school burp a lot
For some people that's their only thing they can do at school
Brian burps a lot , I mean
Like Holl
Like Holly
Ew
And Elisha
And Kit , not really
0
Uhoh , I burnt the meat
You burnt the plan
Just slightly
Your thing's rocking on the burner
It happens , Its happened
Nothing's been caught fire , we're fine
That's good
So how was your visi
Oh , we had dinner with this , this family with this kid
He's like in first grade or kindergarten
But he was so funny , like he talked nonstop , like the whole time , he just talked and talked and talked
And like , um , he was like , he was always trying to find the cats
but they were really scared of him
but then he was like he , he found the mouse like that or something and he was like "/
Ok I'm going to give it to the cat because he likes it
and then he went and gave it to the cat and then he just left and he was like "/
yeah , the cat , if the cat doesn't like me I'm not gonna stay around him
or something , I don't really remember what he said but it was really funny
That's not a good way to end a long story
To get to the last part and say I don't remember what he said
I can't tell it
I can't tell the story , I mean , someone else should tell the story
There's a little glitch in that one because nobody else was there
drama and like voice majors will sing anywhere they are cuz
that's like them getting their practice in
which I think is kind of bothersome
I don't think that makes them that great though necessarily
I think a lot of them learn theory
but I think there's still a lot of variation in their skills
I'm not saying , like I'm not
it's not just me though , but when I'm singing
where I'm just kind of mumbling
Oh , I see , I see
That's just kind of weird
You walk by a person like that
You have no idea , hahaha
I see
Because the earphones are up
Is a dead giveaway though , I'm talking about people without earphones
I'm kinda of like , what are they doin
I think it's like in
Okay
Broadways
Where they are fighting over everything , suddenly they start singing
Haha , except life's not a musical
Hahaha
No , I mean
Life , the musical , now hit show on broadway
You're going to write a playwrite aren't you
I know it , and I'm going to be like damn it rob , this was my idea and my title I get ownership rights
This is copyrighted , we're on record , this will be our evidence
If this is copyrighted , I want mine
It was your idea
I watched phantom of the opera the other day
Oh how was i
I wasn't really watching it
Okay
I have the dvd at home
I have never seen it on broadway
Which is kind of sad
well , my roommates were watching it
at my place , and I was kinda watching
Okay
on and off , and I really didn't
want to watch the ending
I really wanted to see it on broadway
Right , aren't
they touring it here or somethin
I thought they were
Yeah , I don't know
I should know , but
I also
want to see Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
I know , it's a play
by shakespear
No no no no no
It's a play off of
the two characters from hamlet
that is written by shakespear , sorry
that's what I meant
and it's the two guides
Two guards
two guards
Maybe we could analyze
the word modules
Hahahaha
This is Yoonie not getting enough caffein
I have plenty
It just means I'm not getting enough sleep
But anyway , so
Is it a musical too , I thought it was a movie
it's a play
A play , or whatever
It's nothing like shakespear
right
It's um
Isn't it british dry humor thoug
um , a bit
there's a lot of logic and rhetoric
oh , ok
It's like play on words
Yeah , and
the logical fallacies
I mean , these two people
like , it's it's
it's talking about how
hamlet and these two guards
are sent off to do something
and then
sent off to watch over hamlet because
You know , hamlet's father was
Yeah Hamlet's uncle was like
watch out for hamlet because he's gone crazy
so , yeah
they're sent to spy on him
Yeah , well
part of the spying process was
hi , could you please send
hamlet to his death
hmm
and
hamlet turned the tables on them
remember when
uh
I don't remember that line
I don't remember that line either
I don't remember that line of hi , could you send him to his death
um
they send
Hamlet to a foreign kingdom
with a note
with rosencrantz and guildenstern
ohhh
Hi , this guy
we don't need anymore , please kill him
something like that
but um
I remember that scene now
Hamlet finds the letter
and changes it around
so it says hi , would you kill these two guards
so the
rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
the play talk about this whole
life they wake up and
they are extras in a play
they don't have anything to do , until
well , when they
when their scene comes on
they're just sitting around
and
they do what they're told to do
um hmm
they go there and they
it's it's really
really interesting
I have the play at home
okay
I don't know if you want to read it or not
You have to some time
Okay
Okay
Okay
sounds good
My favorite play was
um the something of being earnest
the importance
the importance of being earnest , thank you
that was funny , because
it was play on words
it's pretty funny
I read that play for
english class in high school
do you like play on word
Umm
I can appreciate it
I don't know if I'd necessarily go
out and seek it
but I can appreciate it
have you ever seen a movie
called his girl friday
No
It's black and white
it's
back when they
started the style of
um conversations
that were very very fast
and there's bantering between
the two main characters
and everybody else in it
it's a really good movie
it's actually on the top
movies on IMDB
okay
I dunno , I don't
remember
but it's a really good movie
sounds good
His Girl Frida
They made
a remake
Don't watch the remake
okay
I think the remake actually has
Christopher Reeves
hmm
yeah
So , this is a horrible question
for me to be asking
it reflects how much of current affairs
I don't know
but is christopher reeves still aliv
No
Ok , that's what I thought
He was in bed
um , and
developed something else
and wasn't able to
I forget
But I don't really consider that
current events
I mean
it's not
it's not world affairs
haha , that's true
well
I guess so
um
it's funny though , when I think of superman
I don't think of christopher reeves
anymore , oh are you okay , oh my god , don't choke
but I think of Dean Cain
oh god
as the new superman
you watch that one
Yeah , I used to
Do you watch , Do you watch smallville
No
No , oh , okay , I don't watch it either
I watch a little bit , I mean if it's on
I'll watch it
for fun , but it's
ehhh , whatever , I
I'm always like
you watch everything
yeah I do
It's funny
cuz I really don't watch tv
but then again
I pretty much know
everything
you don't watch things religiously , but if it's on
and if I have nothing to do
I may watch it
if I find it entertaining , if I have nothing better to do
I may
There's always something better to do
Cook
okay , I guess I could do that
some day we'll go to the strip district
and get
Not here
I do more of that when I'm home
oh at home , oh , okay
Home , where my friends are at college
or working
when I'm home for break , usually
our breaks don't match up too
and then like
you know
whenever I'm at home , if , it's hard for me to explain
I guess being an only child kind of goes
into it
I'm just like , I don't like
being around people
too much , like I can
do it , I like
it I like it
but not always
every
time
thing
so like I like
maybe I should just rephrase
to be like , actually
I just like it when
I can just sit there and
have nothing to worry about , nothing pressing to do
and I don't want to do anything else
but watch tv
and then , I will enjoy
my
episode of smallville
or you know
superman , or whatever
that's an interesting revelation
for a ca
that you don't like to be around people
I don't mean it that I don't like to be around
people , cuz I am
a people person , you know how I am around people
I'm totally outgoing
but every so often , I like
to be a couch potato
and just be
worthless
for about an hour
that's what I like to do , exactly
so , you know
like last night there's absolutely nothing
getting done
oh ok , you just sat and breathed
Yeah , sat
and breathed , ate cheesecake
Holy crap that's a lot of duct tape
wha
We got bored
Holy crap
you got bored
I can see that
Naptime for everyone
Hey
no
If I wasn't scared of heights , I'd be like grossly up there
I'd pro'ly roll off
yeah , me too
'cause I'll just fall asleep an' to the sleep area , or where everyone meets
I think I may go curl up on the other side of the shell
awwww
Didn't anybody get any sleep last night
I got like three hours
I got like three , and a half hours
Actually , my problem right now is that my back hurts , so I'm going to lie down on the floor
which is more than getting
but
well yeah
like , if I start lifting things today , somebody yell at me
I think my REM sleep schedule is slightly changing to account for buggy
I would have been , like , overworked a little
Wha
My REM sleeping schedule is accounting for buggy now I think
eh , I've been , randomly waking up at like , six thirty
Alright , I'm gonna try this out
half way between buggy and when I usually get up
ye
You're body's average , it's like Split the difference
aw , there's stuff up on this one
ohhhh
you wanna have this on
yeah
I'm gonna try that one
If anyone sees me lifting , you are totally allowed to yell at me
ahhhw , this is dirty
I wouldn't do that , no I'm thinking I'll pro'ly fall off
there's something
this' scary , I can't even get up here
then I'm gonna try
okay so the push captains are
or pro'ly I should give you
wha
so you just do what you want , righ
the captains are getting called
course walks are done
if you want to clean windshields , I'm not sure that's been done
Oh God , there's nothing to wear oh , God
I'm on it
this is not a good idea
we've got twenty five minutes 'til chairmans
oh my God
you can't get down now
and then if you look out the window
oh , you're , you're evil
you had course walks , so wha was
yeh , there was
it was awesome today
oh shish
it just , well we also , it was about average
it was all ready to go fast , more than
ah , the only thing that was really bad was /
oh my God
hill five , so /
myself for being bored
we may end up waiting , like , half an hour instead of starting right at six fifteen , but I can't imagine , unless it rains again
I'm gonna go to sleep then
it's gonna dry out , it's just taking a little longer since those trees shelter it
well , I was here to drive ,
see how
like the trees right out there
so , 'cause the wind has been , has dried off pretty much everything , except for hill five
or you can just land on top of him
and hill five isn't really
well , and as you can see , look out the window , it's not too
it's kind of moist , but it's not , you know , like , its not slick or anything
so , so I suspect that , er , I know Arnold's been driving on it like a madman , he probably shouldn't be driving in his state
so , now , if someone scares me
I'm definitely gonna fall
'r you asking , number
nobody scare Vincent
no loud noises please
I remember up there and Roach banging on the glass on the outside , and he almost fell off
yeah , I remember that
that sounds kind of nyeh
um , its
but yeah , it's , if someone banged on the glass right now I would fall off
yeah
y'know why
ahhhhww , why is the course being in such shitty shap
it better not rain , I'll be annoyed if it rains
I love sitting where everyone else
I thought you said you were
I dunno , I wouldn't mind
'e should set
we have twenty minutes 'til chairmans' meeting , twenty minutes 'til chairmans' meeting
wait , wait shsh
wait , what'd he sa
twenty minutes to chairmans'
twenty minutes to chairmans'
twenty minutes to chairmans'
no no
not that , um , uiigh
oh , you said you changed your mind
well , like , if it rains , I won't be annoyed when he
well I'll be upset , but I'm not going to be annoyed at- at Arnold
if it was about the nineteenth or about the twentieth , does it make any difference of people being mad at Arnol
oh , we're not going to be mad at Arnold
oh , you said you'd be mad at Arnold or something
no
I said I should be mad
no , I'll just kill someone
I assumed it would be Arnold , since it would be
so you'd be homicidal , but not to anyone in particular
yep
it's just
for failing to call down the rain earlier
well , that was all , that was nice
oh no , I wouldn't mind the rain starting around
a little before eight
we can only roll for so long
I don't really mind some rain unless its like seven fifteen when we're supposed to start rolls , and then we didn't , basically
thing is , it's gonna be , we're going to start late anyway , 'cause we , wait , I suspect , unless they decide not to wait for hill five to dry
but , I suspect that they're starting to sweep
is the chute getting dr
the chute is dry
everything on , everything that's on like that side of the course is dry because it's windy
but because the trees here are sheltering it , it's it's just , not dry
yeah
but the chute is like bone dry
this is like CIA nap time here , man
is it ever not CIA nap tim
at this time of mornin
can you get me some mil
good point
yeah , and maybe , ah , some grits , Yeah
do we get a wakeup fair
or farina , farina's so good
I've never had farina
it's like , mush
you know the wakeup fairy /
but it's good once you /
would come around and like /
touch your sleeping mat , and then you were allowed to get up
nainainainai
you couldn't get up without a wakeup fairy
it's called the , it's just the waiting , like
dootdidoodidooo
so , Gilroy , where are all those mechanics that you recruited , like you , yeah
They're playing games right now
damn , nah
including Kevin
laaame
I know , I , if it weren't for buggy , I'd be playing games right now
is Mike Gordon feeling better , or
Mike Gordon played Smash Brothers , but I beat him , so he's not feeling better
I meant , you know , physically , not mentally
oh , ah
he might , he is
so if he comes to buggy , he's helping them to do his OS , so I don't think he's going to be helping them
or something
he might show up , I don't know
okay
but you only pop every five seconds instead of every second like they did in , the other last one
oh , are they comin' her

yeah , well , I think- what happened was Helen was supposed to pick it up and now her car's not starting or something , I don't know , I just know
oh
yeah , she was like I'm going to bed and dealing with it in the morning , but
her her , ah , housemate is
big into fixing cars , so he'll fix it I'm sure
Wass'll manage
what , you mea
Yeah , Matt Wasserman
Helen is living with Wasserma
yeah , it's Helen , Wasserman and Alberto
I thought they
that'd be an interesting household
it is
no , there's only three rooms
so , it's enough reason
ohhhh , alright , that makes a lot more sense
Fourth person would be like me and Justin
that makes a lot of sense now
we , like , live in their livingroom on weekends
so
wha
the room with the couches is locked
mmm
anybody have Sara would have to be couche
floor's comfortable
Anybody an undergraduate business majo

hu
ohhh
I forgot
like I gave you money last wee
yeah , thank you

Justin owes me money
is this from Pamela's , there were twenty dollars in there
yeah
Justin owes me money
Justin owes me money for all of my food that he eats
reall
I'm just gonna wake up my I'm only a side so I'll just make it up to you
Like half my budget goes into Justin's stomach , I swear
that's what you get for living with a young adult male
I know , I know , yeah , I wouldn't I wouldn't care if he bought me groceries , he used to be really good at buying me groceries , but now he just , like , forgets
oh , speaking of groceries , are you going to
am I going shopping soon , I dunno , I
should , 'cause right now I've been- had pasta , like , four meals in a row
I think I
hey , don't dis pasta
need to go shopping before I eat everything
in our apartment
wha
need to go shopping before I eat everything in our apartment
sounds like a plan
Don't dis pasta
um , I need to talk to Helen
It's been , like , my dinner for the last , like , three months
as long as it's not , like , Ramen
yeah
I should respond to him at least
alright , I can give him a call
there's nothing wrong with ramen
what's tha
ra- ramen has it's place
I don't eat ramen
just not , like , not plain every day
yeah , not every day
I think ramen is bad
I refuse to eat ramen
yeah , Ruby , we need more shinaumuene
or something like
ohhh , did you hear what they're planning to do tonigh
wha
they're going to the , 'cause apparently I have
if you , like , cook up some chicken or vegetables and add that to the ramen then yeah , you can have that maybe a little more frequently
to be making real ramen
'cause like , every single day I make like a pound of pasta
And I take a vitamin C supplement so I don't get scurvy
Mina and Shi and Rosa are going to make real ramen
that's my goal
real ramen is , like ,
not to get scurvy
and I was like what
yeah , I don't know , it's like
so , all that pasta , and all those carbs , and you still aren't going to be a pusher this yea
dos , eggs ,
like , right now , I'm too time to get going , but it's not like I don't play volleyball
and then , they , after they dry it , see , they just put it in rice
for like ten hours a week , and I don't play basketball , and I push at push practice
s , they
I know
It's not like i'm , lazy
What were we even talking abou
Well , skateboarding , houses on hills , on beaches , in lakes
New York
Yeah
Having a helicopter , having a plane
One that goes on water , a speedboat
A neighborhood
neighborhood
That helicopter would be pretty sweet
CSKO
Chief skateboarding officer
Oh , heh
Chief skateboarding officer
You'd be my CIO
No , no , uh , CITO
Chief information technology officer
I could do that , sure
Yo use the Six Sigma and make the information flow a lot nicer
Yeah
but don't get the Six Sigma syndrome
Oh man , you know I saw the guy that made that speec
Oh reall
Yeah
Jeff Blogs , err Bloggle
Uh , like Bogle
Bogle
Yeah I was just sitting across from one of the , the current interns
and he was in the middle of a sentence , he looks up , he goes
yeah that's Jeff Bogle out there
the guy who founded the company and I was like , what
Wow
Yeah he's really old
Are the older people like , really smar
Uh , what do you mea
he older people at the
Would they know how to like , do all this shit
that the company doe
like investment
No , not investment , like the technical stuff
Oh this is a , this is a , mutual funds company
Yeah , so
Oh
so he probably knows how to invest stuff but /
Oh
I doubt he really knows that much about technology
Yeah , he probably doesn't
I thought it was like , uh , IT
nah , like what I would be doing is IT but
Yeah
but the company itself is like mutual funds and
I mean , think of it this way , IT is like a lot of , like , databases , righ
right
databases are just like , ways to analyze information
right
information that , like investors don't really , use daily
they just use like , say , mutual funds or investments
you're just like , ok I see this , this , I should go for it because of intuition or like calculated present value
This is how to analyze all that information , how to make it flow , and analyze risk and stuff
So people who are making investments don't know anything about what they're doing
right
His stuff is all like backdrop
What is analyzing risk
Umm , so , say
Is that like economic
It can be economics
Or is it busines
mmmm , statistics
statistics
yeah
aw
statistics is everywhere
that's , no no no , but that's like
you can have any major
I was an econ major and I've been doing risk for two years
That's what I'm going into , risk management
Yeah but I bet you have to take a lot of stats classes
Fuck that man
All you need to know how to do is Excel
Excel , common sense
All my shit was common sense
I had my data team working on the data flow
That's why you thrived
I was like , data team , go
yeah it was sad , they were forty years old I was twenty and I was telling them what to do
see if I had my way that data team would be replaced by like an intelligent , artificial like , you know
just basically , a machine learning
Oh wait , I mean like the thing
automated IT tea
You have no idea dude , this guy , this guy , ok so he ended up getting a promotion and one of my friends from CMU is now doing that job
uh huh
like uh , I was like , yo you want a job in Japan and like , I got it for him , righ
this job you pump out two reports a week
the same reports , same data pools
aw that's so boring
pull it into an Excell sheet
and make make it every , and it takes like two days of like pulling data and putting it
because they don't have a fucking automated thing for this
that's retarded
yup
I mean like he also does like , he highlights all the , like the weird like anything that's like aberrations , err like too high a variance , he like
uh huh
points it out but that can all be done on a fucking computer
yeah seriously
I've written programs that are dumber than that
err I mean smarter than that and they get paid
like fifty thousand a year to pump out fucking bullshit
and I would take that and then I would analyze it
So , so what really is like IT the
Oh that's not IT , that's for
IT is like setting up the databases
yeah , it depends , I mean I
one of the things I could be doing is writing applications for like internal use
so like trying to make the business more efficient by like writing a better application that they use
or he could be doing websites
yeah
I mean like , uh , the company website , you have to have , you have to have a huge intricate data flow so you know like there's no like idle time for the customer
That's what I'm studying
I don't know if I want to do that anymore
that's the boring shit man
but that depends on the company that you're working for though
you kno
Oh but I thought like I wanted to do that
but like think of it this way
if you're doing this as like , if you're doing like , um , premium stuff for like , if you're doing uh , for a website design company , you'd be designing different types of websites all the time , righ
right
don't go for the corporate websites , corporate websites are usually done internally
go for the ones that are like driving hardest , skateboarders
that kind of interesting stuff , that could be fun
that means you have to go out , collect the fucking
yeah but I bet you don't gotta , you don't make shit for money i bet
probably not
I mean like , with selling websites it's not that bad though
you have to be able to pump it out
it depends man
if you can write a really good website , you go to a company and you're like , hey look at all this stuff I can do for you
don't smile over at me
don't smile
You're upset with me
ha , no
is this bette
oh
Christin do you ever do the evil ey
stink eye , oh man
she doesn't really have an evil eye though it's all kinda cute
try baby
no
yeah try
you can't do it on the spot
yeah
it has to be like
guys can't do the evil eye
I I just I just glare at people
yeah
yeah
I can't see Quinn doing it , or Timmy doing it
The evil ey
yeah
mine's like
Mine's just like uh
I can't do like
It's only , only if I'm really angry
Oh , when you're eye goes like
just like
I dunno , i just like furrow my brow and i'm like
In my mind it's the most intense
My sarcastic look is just like
yeah
the squint one eye and be like
it's just like , what the fuck are you thinking
yeah , what the fuck did you just say
what you just said made me fucking dumber
and for that I'm gonna look at you like this
you know Lerne
Ma
No , um
Andrew , yeah
He wants to do like , so he's Mech_E righ
Yeah
So he's just gonna go like work for a skateboard company and design new wheels and stuff
Oh , that's cool
yeah , righ
so like , apply what you know to what you like
I still don't know what I'm gonna do though
'cause like , skateboarding
I'll like program the next smart snowboard or something
put in the speedometer
yeah
like in the gravity boards
that wouldn't be too bad , you just look down and you see like how fast you're going
yeah
they have those in the gravity boards
airtime
you jump and you're like , alright
It'd be a lot better if there was some kind of electronic thing that could transmit into a watch
oh yeah , ok
'cause looking at your board could be really dangerous , if you're going down , you're just like
what does that say
it's like you're like , what the , oh shit cliff
I've definitely had to do that , like if the board gets too much snow on it you can't move it around very well
can't you just pop it of
yeah , i mean , it depends , some snow sticks to it
or like gets caught up on your
see i think i would just jump up in the air and just
just grab it
nonchalantly just
could always do like a backflip , just kick it off
I could just pee it on , pee on it
while you're movin
that's dangerous , pissing into the wind
yeah
yeah just gotta be like
Hey , did you read that article about Googl
No , what articl
Um the one about the like the US government having issues with Google um policy on not giving them information about who searches what websites or what websites they hi
No like what's going o
Um like ok , so the story goes like this
Google well a lot of search engines have been like targeted by the governent
hmm
because they want to be um sort of , they want , the government wants to like crack down on things like pornography , terrorist /
Yeah
sites , you know , and all that sort of nonsense , and um so they asked search engines to give them all the information about who hits what sites , and Google was one of them you know because /
right
like a the major search engine /
Right , right , right
and um uh they basically were like um Noo heh
Yeah , that's good
I mean , they stalk us enough , like /
I know , seriously and then um but I I mean like so they said no , and there's a whole court case going on and I I mean like I just I mean you kind of feel like you're not the things that you do , you're always being watched
I know like the government in so Big Brother right now like
I see
but like there's no they have no right to like spy on us , and we're already like spying on each other enough with like Facebook and everything /
Right , exactly
like there is no
privacy huh the Internet is so not safe
But what , ok , wait , alright , what's the deal with Faceboo
I don't like actually , like sororities and stuff like they're all like all the Greek organizations are like , You need to like make sure your Facebook is safe because like uh the police and um even like employers like buy Facebook profiles /
Right
from the schools , and then they like look on your Facebookand and like if there's pictures of you with like alcohol and you're underage , they'll like arrest you or like not hire you and stuff like that
Arrest yo
So , they're gonna arrest you
Yeah , like the police can buy Facebook profiles and they , like , they arrest people /
Right
Doesn't tha
Well I how come a lot of people not know about thi
Because I feel like you know like the word isn't spread around because if that's the case , then why would people you know like still have those images up or I guess you know
People don't think about it
They're just like , Oh , I need to pretend that I'm cool /
so I'm gonna put like the funniest picture I can up and like it's so stupid 'cause like it's like politics is gonna change in the future because like every politician is now gonna have like evidence /
solid background , yeah
of the bad things they did in college
Oh , my god , that's crazy
So we need to be more careful I guess but
But , I think like that's your own page it shouldn't be like I mean we can't access other schools , and you can lock your profile
Yeah but you the police can buy profiles , and then they can
No but like I
No like they can they they have ways and like you can also like people like save pictures that you have in your like albums /
Ok , Ok
and then like even if you take it down , they have that picture saved
Oh , wow
Yeah
that's like a crazy I really didn't know
It's like this huge controversy
And like I mean it started out just like um we had to have like repre like we wanted to represent the fraternity /
Right , right
well like people from nationals would um like get people in trouble for having certain things that would be against the rules
Oh my god
on their profile , and obviously like you shouldn't be breaking the rules /
Right
or whatever but if you do like , don't take pictures of it , and if you are don't put them on your Facebook
exactly
Like I mean I almost think you deserve it if you're gonna do something like that retarded , but
But wait so like I mean so does like does your sorority like have these rules now like don't put certain pictures u
Well /
Or wha
we're like um kinda hesitant to make rules about it /
Right
but we're like strongly encouraging people to be careful /
Right
and like um just monitor what you're doing and like if you want I mean they did like all these seminars and stuff about it just like what's going on and like what you can do to protect yourself /
Right
but I mean it's almost like you shouldn't even really have a Facebook profile anymore
I know
It's not even safe
Like that makes me wonder like how many people know exactly what sites I've been t
That makes me scared
Like it doesn't make me want to use yahoo anymore
I know
it makes me not want to say anything to anyone on Facebook
I hate computers
I just like at the clusters like I don't know if anybody is like looking at what I check online
Exactly
or anything
It's kinda crazy , and it's it's creepy in a way because I mean even the university because you use their lab has records I'm sure of where you /
Yeah
like have been and stuff I mean they're more liberal because they don't care I mean it's you know
But like the recording industries /
Right
can get your IP address /
Exactly
and everything
Exactly , and that's like a huge issue because I mean IP address means location means this is who you are especially being on like a CMU network like on a university network it makes it a lot tougher I think
Yeah
I don't know it's just it's crazy the amount of spying that goes on
I know and like even like when you put up a Facebook profile or like a Blog or whatever /
Right
like you you're asking to be spied on /
Exactly
like you're doing it because you want it to be public information , but like you don't necessarily want it to be public /
Right
you want it to be like semiprivate , but still like /
I mean if you think about it you know just how they did on the phone like if you would say certain key words like god or you know like some religious term /
mmmhmm
they would like pick it up and listen to your phone call and here , I feel like that's the same thing on the Internet they would probably have the sites and a lot of filters saying , ok , these are the set of key words and like let's go to these sites and see what's happening and then you know like I guess find people out that way
I mean how would you hide stuff like that I mean I'm sure there's like a lot like I know like in Germany they banned the whole like Adolf Hitler's biography or autobiography , Mien Kampf /
mmmhmm
and then like the fact is you can still find it on the Internet , which I find hilarious /
because like I mean what can the government do I mean how can they block tha
Yeah
It's it's seriously like I mean maybe that is a good thing I mean you can't really censor everything and then /
Yeah
and you shouldn't do it because it's I guess a sort of freedom you know that people
It's a freedom , but it's also like people are abusing it like
Well , that's true but then you can't be all like secret about it /
Yeah
like that that scares people and you don't wanna I don't want to be fearful everytime I go to a site that like I I use a search engine that like my information will be sent and people are looking at you know where I go and stuff like I don't know that's just creepy to me
But you know like I know in Dubai that they block sites they just completely don't let you go into sites like I was trying to look for um who's that guy that was had all those predictions about all the
Oh , Nostradamu
Yeah Nostradamus
I was trying to I I had read something about him , and I was trying to Google it to find more information , and like the site was blocked
I was like , It's Nostradamus I can understand if it's like a porn site or something /
Yeah
but it's like like they took no they had I don't think they like like other religious advertisements well like like not religious but I would say um Pagan sort of /
Yeah
symbollisms , and like and beliefs you know that this can happen they don't like that so they completely block the site heh it was so funny
Like yeah I don't like the idea of censorship and everything , but at the same time you can't go on Google without typing like some random word that like you would think is innocent and then getting all these porn sites
Exactly like yeah I've had that happen to me and I'm like ummmm because I was trying to look for a movie and it just like shot up a whole bunch
even if like the words are not related
Yeah I mean it's like this is an innocent word I don't understand /
I know I know
So we need like some censorship I guess but I mean without like
harming people
it's harming people yeah and like
infringing on people's rights
But that's tough I mean like I don't know how porn sites are gonna do it because like I mean how do you tell if a person is eighteen or no
yeah
I mean you can lie over the Internet it happens over AIM it happens over MSN you know people lie to each other about their age and then get people talking so I don't know
So we'll change topics when we get to my skirt , er my dress whatever
So I bought this like long skirt from this girl who sells , you know , things from India
uhhuh
Um and she's doing it as like half for her profit and half for helping out her grandmother's um orphanage that she
they they are running
oh wow
and so that skirt was like twenty five
to buy and um , and then it had , it had like a slight rip in it so she made it fifteen
so so i bought it
I was like it's nice
and it has a lot of fabric so I figured I can alter it , change it
um , so so what I wanted to do with it was like , well I could either make a pillowcase out of it
'cause it's a nice little cushion that I could have or
i kinda actually wanted as like a , like a sundress , like this , on top
Oh yea , that'd be nice
yea and then it would kind of like fit like here , but it's hard to make it that way
so then i was like
well , and then , so I was trying to ask my grandmother for help
and i asked her , and she ended up just getting it shortened
which is not what I wanted to get done
oh
so
so I took it all apart
and luckily I still have enough fabric leftover to make it
but it would have to be now in two pieces
so now I'm like
well , maybe I'll just make a separate skirt that I can wear and a separate like , tube top , kinda thing
So I'm working on it , I don't know
I haven't decided
I I still could make into a sundress though
It would just be in two pieces I would have had to connect it here
which isn't a problem 'cause I would have to like cut it here to make it fit anyway
uhhuh
So it would be interesting but in anyway in any case
Why didn't you go down to , uh , Jo_Anne's sometim
I don't know I just
You didn't want to go
I don't know where that is
It's in
rob , uh , Robinson town center
i've passed by it a few times on the bus
It's actually kinda nice
reall
oh
okay
There's a Sam's Club , there's a Best Buy , Compusa , Best Mart , two different ski shops There's There's a whole mall
everything Jo_Anne's , which is the uh
There's Noblemen Jo_Anne's , which is the
uh fabric store
i needed to get a button for one of my shirts and
i need to get um thread for my pajamas , which have a giant hole in them
ok
The tone of Y's voice is kinda of lackadaisical
hahaha
t's ok when i'm at home and I'm wearing pajamas with a giant hole I like them , they're really comfy
But
you know , well if someone visits me , then I have to go and change
when guests come over , I have to go change and there's
We get a lot of people in my room like friends who just come
people in your roo
yea , I mean , I mean just uh , friends who come visit
yea
I want some sugar
perspective more sugar , do you have troubl
no , I'm already
I thought you were
nah , i'm okay
So what's this that you're adding to our te
It's sugar
This did not ook like sugar for some reason , I dont know why
Taste it
I don't use MSG
Oh , oh I believe
I believe you that is
It's sugar
It's sugar
I use MSG
It's not good for you
It's not good for you , but neither is Coke and everything else
But people drink that
Caffeine's not good for you either
That's true
Caffeine's in tea
Tea gives you antioxidants
What exactly does that mea
It um it's like things that will help your cell recover from free radical damage
which is like
free radical damag
so like , there's these things that , like , yes , these things that like , go around in your body , yea
whatever
I still don't know what that means
yea
oh my god
yea , it's okay
that's okay
so yea , that's how antioxidants works
so that's okay
and tea usually has less caffeine than coffee
hu
I told you uh I drink a cup of tea almost every morning
which isn't bad
ha
You've become caffeine dependent
See what I like , is , like , I usually try to avoid caffeine normally , so that my body gets used to functioning normally
and then when I need to stay up all night , I can just like have a cup of coffee and it'll buy me like three or four hours
'cause my body's not used to all that caffeine
this is like the people who do not drink for a really long time so that they get their tolerance really low
so they only need like two beers to get drunk
yea , exactly
kinda like that
so
but
u done with the suga
Yea
I don't know
I mean , I don't think it's much of the caffeine
I think it's more of a psychological effect of
caffein
yea , i think i think if i got up in the morning and just
just put warm water in my teacup and drank it , it does the same
I don't think so
Caffeine actually does make your brain fire more uh
like , 'cause it basically puts your body into a state of like , emergency energy recall or whatever
uh huh
it makes like u need to like
burn off more energy 'cause it's like high alert so it does stimulate your brain to be a lot more alert , so
so for the first few days , you'll feel the effects of caffeine withdrawal at first so you'll feel headaches and you'll feel lethargic and all that
and then
and then afterward , you might , you know
I
I will go by without caffeine without drinking my tea in the morning
emhm
It's just I always wake up too late
You're always late , Robert
I am always late
as everybody here knows
Or I'll forget my cup on my table oh , I've done that a lot of times , and you can't drink tea after it's been soaking all day
em hm
It's There's stuff there's too much stuff comes out of those tea leaves stuff that you don't want to be drinking
oh okay
I think I don't know It's just the act of making the tea
like a little ceremony in the morning
It's something to do first thing in the morning , besides you know , wake up , brush your teeth , and wash your face
getting dressed get online
get out of my holey pajamas
em hm
I wonder if these
the tapioca tastes the same
I think that they taste the same
I was so happy when I found them in china town
I was looking for them
I was asking around
there's one girl who spoke really good English and was Chinese in the
so , this girl speaks English I can talk to her
so like do you know where they would sell you know like the bubbles the tapioca pearls from bubble te
She thought I meant bubble tea
So she told me a store , and I was like , no no , I don't need bubble tea , I just want the actual pearls so that I can make them on my own time later
So she goes , oh I don't know
and then we just walked down a little bit more , and then we went to the bakery
And then we went to
whe
over Spring break
oh
and then wha
you went hom
yea
and then we went to I was there twice
ah ha
and we went to , uh , the grocery store
and
And then , like , I found them
They were like right by the doorway
It was like , Awesome
I walk in
and I'm looking for this stuff , and I just I turn , I like walk in , I turn and look to my right and there they are , in this like little thing , and they're like stacked up
and there's a lot of them and it's just like tapioca pearls
and it says , ready in five minutes
and I was like , perfect
well , you can get tapioca pearls here you know , in the strip district
well I don't go to the Strip District , remembe
you still haven'
oh
I don't have a car
I do I stay within the Oakland Squirrel_Hill radius
It's easier on my life
So but um
So yea so
so That's where I bought them
and I was like sweet
and then I tried it that night and I was like , oh
this is actually good
and so we were gonna go back the next day , 'cause my friend Victoria was staying with me for break
and so she's never been to New York city
'cause she's from Chicago and so she's like 'eh , New York you know , I I'm from a city
But I was like you need to come
If like , you know , she wasn't doing anything for Spring Break besides going to see her brother in the later half
So I was like , why don't you come home with m
So I was like , I would love to have you come you know , stay at my house
You're more than welcome to
um and uh , just come see New York with me 'cause I'm right there
So she's like , okay , let me ask
you know , and you know , I asked my parents
And we worked it out and so we both flew home on Saturday
night and we went out to dinner
oh
We went to we got lobster and little neck clams it was the most and she got king crabs
ohh
and uh you know , my parents took us out to dinner
It was so fabulous It was just so good
hhh Nick you're gonna have to come up off the floor because your voice is going to be muffled which will cause me problems
oh you're ↑recordin
ihhh yes , I'm recording
so what do you have to do this weeken
well , too much
but focusing on tonight , I don't know if you heard
I was talking to Nicole
and I'm picking her up around six forty five
then we're going to see a movie
and then we're going out for dessert or coffee or some other type of girly thing to follow up on our girly movie
which one are you seein
I don't know yet
I am hoping for the duchess so I might just be like
we're going to see this movie unless you really want to see the other one
also because the duchess is playing around the corner so I could park here for free
that'd be nice
where's she liv
New_House
oh that's right
so what are you doing tonigh
I dunno
maybe I'll watch tv or a movie or read
play the ↑new
ihhh probably play the news
there's still a few games I have to do
do you ever get any extra credit for ↑tha
no
just do it for fun no
yeah
I got extra credit first time
does your professor know you still play i
no , hhh
hhh I told her once but I don't think she plays it
so sh I don't think she cares hhh
hhh That company only made two games
and one is that one and one is the other one I got extra credit for
weird
are they from around here , or are the
yeah
and they're CMU based or they graduate graduates of CMU
mmhmm
I dunno where they are now
probably California where all those video game people are
although , I think they might be on Craig_Street actually
and I think about it
because I think you used to have to go down there to take the test
oh
or to play the other game
that's where all of those paid experiments are now and I find that extremely annoying
because I used to be able to do paid ones in the bottom of Baker
you know , through that websit
and I just don't feel like walking over to Craig Street or running there to do a forty-five minute experiment
mhmm
and then run back
where do they do the MRI one
I think somewhere in the South Side
cuz someone I talked to went and she said they picked her up and everything
wow
but yeah
and those are like a hundred fifty bucks , righ
I think so
it depends
um some paid more than others
someone I ↑thought got paid almost four hundred dollars but it was because you had to keep going back
yeah
whereas I think the one time ones are like seventy five or a hundred
hmm , that's still a lot of money
speaking of which , I heard back from that guy about the experiment we were looking into
and he said that you only get gift card
although then everyone's entered into a raffle for a hundred and fifty dollars
but he didn't say how long it would go on for
which made me suspicious
gift cards for wher
gift cards
he didn't say
he said like ten to twenty dollar gift cards max
but he also didn't indicate if it was per couple who went or per person
he's sneaky
mhm
you should e-mail him back and ask specific questions
I would like to know more about compensation pleas
although , oh , there's free dinner though too , but it's like a two or three hour time commitment
I know once a week
that is so long for twenty buck
that's what I was thinking
unless they have really good dinner
cuz I hate cooking
it has to be a really good dinner
hhh but it also means no dishes
so what is i
they just record or that we have to do the same question packe
he didn't say
we'd have to do a phone interview
and then possibly be qualified or eligible I guess
that sounds like more work than it's worth
yeah
I know I shouldn't care about science but
not this semester
no
there are easier experiments that you can make money with
from
yeah , maybe I'll look into some of those
you hardly ever have time during the day though
well if I do stuff after three I have time
three to five
but I don't think they have that many then
the ones I see are always like in the middle of the day
hmm
I do have a lot to do
although when I write down the actual assignments
I guess there aren't that many of them numerically to finish
but they're huge
mhmm
so I'm really glad at least I'm done with the NSF
mm yeah
that should be a load off
the Russian thesis is still really hard and I need to work on that this weekend as well as this project
which I can't believe how much of our grade it's worth
well , it's like twenty-four points out of a hundred
so , a hundred being the whole class grad
yeah
that's quite a bit
°yeah°
what time do you register on Monda
I think around ten to noon
I'll have to double check that
I register at one but I got an email
today from my linguistics advisor saying for a two English classes that I have to take she wants us to register through the English department
because
you can do tha
I don't know
she just wants us to go there and do that so that we can get in
but , to me that completely undermines the whole seniors go first
yeah
so I know I'll end up getting in to them
so I'm not even going to worry about it because they have to let me into them
because it's my last semester
but it's just annoying that now instead of registering online
which I'm going to try to do anyway
that I should have to go to the English Department
well your linguistics advisor doesn't seem to be on top of things anyway
no
she's not
it still irritates me about all of the stuff with my research and how she doesn't know anything about it
well at least it counts for your thesis
she hasn't done any of that yet though
that makes me nervous
because I got an e-mail the other day from the dean
and by the other day I mean a week or two ago
saying that like he sees that I'm doing the honors thesis and for my graduation requirements for my majors
I don't know how he knows this but like am I doing three theses then
am I doing a Russian one , a linguistics one and an honors thesi
and I said no
my professor's supposed to have talked to you about combining my linguistics thesis with my honors thesis
because that's what it is
and he said well she had mentioned it in passing but she hadn't filled out any of the paperwork
and that she needs to do that soon
which means it's not going to get done
and I don't think it should be my place to have to remind her
yeah but you might have to
well I will
like if I can't register next semester or something
but
I still have to find out about if I can do research
at least with Borzutsky
I have a feeling I won't be able to because she's very busy
and teaches in Heinz
but she likes you and I don't think supervising you would be that hard
Goldman only meets with me like once a month
yeah I know
and that's for my entire Russian thesis
but I also think if I did research it'd probably have to be a broader scope like the new Cold War
or something
you mean like your boo
yeah , like two of my books have the same name
because , uh /
very creative
I know
someone else is uh doing Georgia versus Russia conflict
but we'll see
plus I dunno if I would be able to do independent research in the department I'm not , well I guess you are so
don't use that excuse
I'll ask her and we'll see
because if I don't , if I'm not able to with her I don't know what I do
maybe I'll ask my Middle East professor if I can do a research project
I need to focus on applying to grad school too
because I was thinking next semester I'm going to have interviews and things which means over Christmas break I have to brush up on all of my readings
which I still think it's sad that that's the only thing I'm interested in at this point the psych research
and what I have least time for even though that's what I'm going in to
yeah
I dunno I think that once you're in the field
you can change interests
well , maybe not in psych
well I wouldn't want to change interests
not once I've started
well I don't mean once you start I mean once you're a professor you can study whatever you want
yeah , a lot of history professors , like Miller , he's Irish History but he's teaching my Christianity class
that's true
and we're nowhere near the Protestant Reformation
so I dunno where the hell he's coming from Ire-Ireland
ancient Galilee
I really like the learning mechanisms though
and I like that that's so broad
but at the same time you can look at it in a very narrow focus
I dunno anything about those so
didn't you read my essay
I did
anyway
I should probably start getting ready
yeah
for my girls' night out
I thought you were going in like an hour
yeah
but I need to dry my hair , put contacts in , put my makeup on
I'll never understand
I wonder if there is a thing
things
random
yeah he kinda just has random information at his finger tips
i don't know how
i don't either
there're just some people that can do that
i don't get it
like there are some people who find out everything like social things to
and just know everything that's going on
wait what do you mean social thing
like who know all the gossip
that's what i mean
reall
and I don't get that by Dan
i don't know if it's they're told or they just figure it out
it would have to be a mix righ
i would assume
you would have to be perceptive enough to see things and then-
people would have to trust you enough to tell them
yeah
tell you about them
but i don't see Tyler as one of those people
no , I don' i feel like he doesn't know like social stuff
just random information
kind of , I think i don't know
and i think i agree with that
he seems not socially awkward
cause he's not awkward
i mean he's awkward but not
in the social way
he's just a bizarre person
so
he's just weird
yeah
which in my mind
in a good way
makes it difficult for people to want to come to him
mhmm
and therefore makes me feel like he's not actually perceptive-
but maybe i'm wrong
so what you got a spicy tuna and something els
california roll
what is a california roll
other than in my mouth right now
um it's rice on the outside with sesame seeds
the inside is umm
fly fish row
avocado-
cucumber- and umm-
crab but it's fake crab
the fish kind
it's
imitation crab
i mean i suppose it could be- real crab but this isn't
how do you kno
i know what imitation crab looks like
and i know what crab looks like
that's a good reason
and crab is a lot more expensive
and they just wouldn't use it-
okay
so really i could eat it if i wanted it
that's kind of useful information
mmm it's fish
right
I mean i eat fish on occasion
so that's why i say if i wanted to eat it
umm so yeah
my conversation with Max
didn't escalate to anger or crying
yay
what were you guys talking abou
u-at the first thing we spoke about
was umm
the Matisyahu concert-
ok
umm
very briefly and his
umm leaving me to walk with Bri
by myself-
mhmm
and how that
like pissed me off amazingly so
and he's like i'm sorry i read the situation wrong
like it seemed to me like you two wanted to talk to each other
so i was just gonna leave you alone
i'm like yeah no that was not
not the case at all
but umm what's done is done
and there's nothing to do about it
and then-
we started talking about Hillel
because Rachel talked to him last night
i know
and- he
thinks he'd do a really good job as president
and so really wants it
and he knows- that being rush chair is
a conflict of interest
but he still really wants it
she told me he didn't seem- think that the co-president was a good idea
he doesn't
did he say wh
umm
he doesn't
like the concept of co-president
unless
the two parties-
umm
lack
a- skill set
that the other one possesses
in- high demand
umm
and he doesn't believe that that's necessarily
the balance between rachel and he
umm
so he'd
be- more willing to be
vice president or
president with
vice versa
but he really doesn't seem to understand that he
like
that being rush chair is not
just a problem
it's- a huge problem
and that he really shouldn't hold both positions
so
can you
kind of
vocalize
what the problem with him being rush chair i
because i know it's a problem and i
know like in my head why but i
can't necessarily put it out
correctly and
so , my feeling is that
the issue with him being rush chair
and- trying to take an active role
in- Hillel
comes a lot from looking at Dave Lewis
Dave Lewis during the orien- the entirety of rush
barely participated in anything Hillel
like if we had an a Hillel event
it could either be a rush event
in which case he would come
mhmm or he wouldn't come
because there would be a rush event
that night so he couldn't-
like the balance was improper
and i mean
it's a question of
time devotion in my mind
and-
Max claims that he'll be present and be able to- lead
and not ha- and have it not be an issue
so that's what i was like one of my main things
when i talked to him and he thinks that he-
can manage his time and his energy
but from what i saw this year
he can't
right
it is of my belief that he cannot
he still believes he can
he also believes that
ummm if- not this year then he will never do it
because- this- year to next year are his two light semesters
umm- the two semesters in which he's not
overloading in course work
and he's not working-
and he's not doing research
all three combined-
so he has time to devote to Hillel
to which my respond is
and A_E_Pi
and he doesn't- really understand that the
two are huge- time commitments
that he's-
eith- he's gonna shaft one
and it will be Hillel
and it will be Hillel-
so i think what he told me his concern was
not knowing how to present himself
if he was both at the same time
like introducing himself to peopl
and be like hi
cause he really shouldn't- a-at least he knows he
shouldn't be at Hillel and be like hey come to A_E_Pi tonight
correct
eventhough we can do that
i think
we can
but that's because we're doing it socially
and he's doing it with an agenda
yeah
umm but like
when you introduce yourself to someone
the question is how are you introducing yourself-
are you introducing yourself just by nam
are you introduc- introducing yourself name and then associatio
and he specifically said in when i was talking to him that he didn't want to be introduced as Hillel president
like
associated with Hillel
is fine but being president was not
okay , and i'm like well then
i don't like
you can't
any other
position that's fine but president
that's the point
right
so
i think he'd be okay at VP
i think he'd be good at it
i think he'd be fine
he can stay there-
but i agree i don't want him
moving up
Rachel doesn't want to
cause a conflict-
correct
ok and i think that
i don't think she'd be a bad president
umm
i don't
think she would be the best
i- i can see where Max would be better
umm but
i'm not convinced that he will actually
perform to his capability
and i understand that Rachel gets frustrated
and can- burn out really quickly
and that'll take a while for her to come back
from that but umm
i think it's
i think that's better
than having devotions elsewhere
maybe i'm wrong-
i think that if the board is like
there enough
that having a weaker president is better than having one who is split
but can we rely on them
that was the question that Max posed
yeah , that was what I said and that was why I said
how is he
at Hillel
you can't rely on having a strong board
but
but then what are you relying on
right are you relying on solely the president
we can't do that
we can't do that
and Max himself says that he's not a programmer
he gets things done
when
other people come up with them
yeah and he'll enable others to get their things done
but he can't
like he's not the brain
behind the- everything
he's a powerhouse not a
right
so
so you need the board
and if
he's not relying upon them
then i'm a little afraid
so
again
i don't know where that leaves us
and i- don't know what's gonna happen
not to mention that he won't be there for elections
which is going to make- elections really really odd
cause he's running for
high up positions
if you want umm an avocado
piece you're welcome to take one
i might
okay
so where does this leave
the election
i have no earthly clue
umm i'm still not convinced that we have- the rest of the board figured out-
i talked with Dave Lewis doesn't want to do it
okay
like for sure
cause it like i mean that's kind of what we assumed
but got the feeling that nobody actually asked
its true no one asked him
i mean if he's up for master righ
i don't know
I mean no one's like definitely telling
me what the nominations were
unless i- gues
or-
ask an individual
ike were you nominated for anything-
yeah so i me-
i don't understand
they're being dumb
i mean
Joe told me but he's like
i don't remember
i honestly don't remember
off the top of my head
umm i feel
like it's Scott Dan
and
Dan Eisenber
and Dave
up for master
i think
Scott would be the best
Dave Lewis is already
too bitter to take it
and Dan Eisenberg
would be would be her-horrible
i mean it would just
i feel like so much would be missed
if he were
yeah
because he's not
a persona
i feel like
do //
why has he has
been in a better mood
Dave Lewi
yeah
like markedly- better
or is this just because like
i don't think
i've he's
stopped like not
talking to me and i'm percieving it as like he's in a better
i don't think he's actually been
any better
ok so /
i'm fairly certain that
this is how he's been since freshman year
too
ok
this is now i have an altered perception
i don't think he'd be bad
i'm afraid of his bitterness
it's really it
i think it depends on if he
sees it as a
like
i have responsibility
let me do my best
ok
'll i mean
cause he was
fine- as-
membe
yeah but
i actually don't know why he was member
because member's like the person you turn to
if you have a problem
i don't see people turning to Dave Lewis
umm
didn't he want master and not win i
i don't remember
i feel like no one remembers
and like people who do won't tell me
no one'll be like yeah this is what happened
because their not going to tell you
who lost last year
it's just not appropriate
yeah
umm see now i just want more sushi
umm but
no take it
you like it so much have one
i ate seven no
more than that
nine ten eleven
umm so i don't know-
i don't know i don't see him as master
like i i really do think he'll it'll be so self destructive
i don't think it would necessarily be good for him
or- i feel like it
c'go either way it could for him
and good for the house or
it could be really /
detrimental
really bad for him
and still ok for the house
or it could just suck for everything
so what i was saying is he was good at booth
but i don't remember exactly what his
didn't he like die during booth
basicall
oh he did
but he did it really well
like the booth was amazing
but he destroyed himself
so
he has that trend
i don't think it's a good one so
i don't wanna promote it
although it's not like we- get
to vote
yeah right
right
umm
what are we gonna do on sunda
when- like for hours and hours and hours
i won't be here
you won't
be here- i forgot
i'm gonna be missing my first like legitimate
girls out of the house forever
elections
it's okay
but
i'm sure we're not doing anything
i'll be up
so- when you find out can
you like give me a cal
mhmm it's easy enough absolutely
umm but e-board doesn't actually
like get changed- until
later right
until
the spring
so they're still e-board
through
winterbreak
mhmm
so- why-
after November-
are they like fre
cause is this like a transition perio
so they at- they don't have as many responsibilitie
or they have more because they have to teach the new e-boar
umm i think they don't have as many
because the new e-board is trying
okay
umm
i th- i mean i think
i'm fairly certain it's not like
the day after elections
is the new e-board
umm because that would seem silly
to me but i don't
exactly remember the transition
process
right
umm
yeah pretty much
i'm sure it's after major board elections
because what'll you know
like you can't hold certain
positions- and then- what if they
do because you're on major like
board position
i don't know makes sense
so i'll be out like
cause on sunday nights
i'm out all night so
i'll just i'll text you
yeah i wanna know
i'll text you
the info
does your or email
you'll have your phone
will do
umm i
i feel like none of them are really good choices
like Scott's really like
he's like a fun guy
and like really great but
i feel like he's not like a leader
he did i really good job with greek sing
did h
yeah
uh-huh
umm organized meetings
got everyone together
he's really organizational
which is i think very good for a President
like i'm not really sure what JB does-
per se-
umm
like i said JB is a really o-like interesting choice and i
wish i was here last year-
so much to like see
all of the stuff that went
on and i feel like i'd have
so much better
he
see who people were before
umm i wish i remembered the elections last year
but he- i think was the better
choice
i think it was him and Dave Lewis
i'm pretty sure i've heard that-
i would buy it
like maybe someone else but i-i-
i don't think that he's bad
it's really interesting
because he's not Robbie
not at all
and even now- i
see how he would
's master of the
but
i think it was interesting because
after- Robbie-
the house basically swore not to have another sophomore-
master and then they elected JB
which i thought was really- interesting
why did they not want another fre-
because- of inexperience
and it's just being young and-
stepping into the role
umm like Robbie-
advised against it
and JB was like well who else
is gonna do it
righ
so he wanted it but
also
i think that because of the way
elections work
both at Hillel and
at A_E_Pi cause
they kinda work the same way-
i think period of time wise
it's a really difficult place , because you can't have
seniors in positions which
are sort of people who really have had
well you you can't have yeah current
seniors cause they'll be gone
umm so that gets rid of like that whole
year of
people who've had the most experience
and you can't have freshmen
because they
just don't know anything
yeah not for A_E_Pi
you like
we can for Hillel
because we need to
but yeah
so you're left with
sophomores
and juniors-
and
i mean you can get
a senior who's running
now like who's a junior now
and so will be a senior
in the spring
or the following fall
yeah like Joe
like Joe
which i think is very good
i think yeah
like i think you need more of those
but how many people would
by that and plus you have to have
some experience
you really should do it like
for more than one year
and it's just a weird like
thinking of
like sophomores being on e-board
is like wow that's really young
and next year it'll be the same thing as
the same like age wise
do you know-
umm who was nominated for leiutenant maste
yes Brandon
i know Brandon and that's it
Big J
okay
there might have been a third but i think
that's it
because like i'm also trying to pair
like people for master
i think that Brandon will get it
i think he will too
but i feel like Big J really should be on e-board
i think he'd be good on it
but he might drop down
i don't know
him as a good sentinel
okay
see i can see him more as
member
I could see that
but i don't know if he would run against Henry i think he'd be better
at it than Henry
cause i feel like people go to Big J for
things and not as much
and not
as much Henry
even though i think Henry's really good
probably should be on e-board
but i think that to some extent certain
people choose what they want and then
other people just fill in the spots
correct
which doesn't always work well
it doesn't- most of the time
but- if you need a-
body of people
yeah
umm so my deal with Henry
is that while he's a really great person
i feel like i don't trust a lot of his decisions
like- Alex
umm and therefore
like i wouldn't go talk to him
about issues of that nature
i just
i don't know i mean
he and Zach like kinda confuse me a little bit as
regards their place in the house
like in the grand scheme of
Zach doesn't
confuse me so much wait
which Zach
Zach
he doesn't confuse me so much
i mean i just i didn't think
of them as like
really- like
kind of up there people
well i guess as far as like
power positions in the house
that's true i don't
i i mean i
don't see them as power positions
but i- see them
as-
umm people who can get the job done
like look at Zach with buggy
yeah
although that'll be fun when he
cause Zach doing buggy around Carnival
and e-board will
i'm sure be loads of fun
but umm-
i think he'll be a good exchequer
he's not opposed righ
he's unopposed
i mean unless someone drops down
which- Dan might
Dan might
i'm not exactly sure he wants it though
i don't know him at al
i mean he's been around
a little more i feel
like sitting around
on the downstairs more
i don't know
as oppose to earlier in the
i want to invite Beth out one day
just be like i wanna
she's really nice
i wanna be your friend
please join us
umm
i think the next time we have a large group of
us we should invite
all them and like i think Lizzy would be fun to have around
Lizz
uh-
Wallnau
oh ok
cause she
she seems really like friendly and like quirky
i don't know anything about her
i don't either but she seems
like pretty
yeah
i
have to start //
are you going that wa
i am headed-
towards- Craig St
in honesty
oh- this its gross
so much soy sauce
okay , um , alright , so animal rights
alright
uh , I just had a page open about it
I closed it when I was trying to find the recorder controls
oh , here it is
okay
so , this is basically a radical vegetarian organization that believes that animals experience suffering , are to some degree intelligent , and therefore it's immoral to keep them in labs , factories , farms , etc
and that they should be placed in homes to live out their natural lives free from suffering
I think it's hard to say , though , that it's doing more harm than good
well , I guess from a purely net gain standpoint , more people profit from
well I don't know if that true is true actually
don't you think , uh , humans eat more animals than humans enjoy eatin
than humans enjoy eatin
well , I mean , we need to eat
if you , if you put it that way it's really all or nothing , we're either eating these animals or we're not , and-
well you don't have to eat meat to survive
no , but , if you're going to say that we do eat meat , given that we eat meat , we need to keep eating meat
not necessarily , why do we have to keep eating i
if we're saying that for the purpose of animals as food , they're really only useful as long as they continue to be useful
yeah I know but , if we're taking the stance that they're
well I dunno , but let's for , say for the sake of argument that they are uh do feel pain and they are intelligent , or at least as intelligent as a very stupid human
or maybe
it's not
well
I think it's just really hard to say that um we should be like liberating animals on such a large scale , especially considering what's done to humans at the same time
well , what do you mea
done to the
what's done to human
aside from whether or not it's right , putting that aside for one second you if you just allow every animal to live out its natural life in its entirety , you're treating them better than a lot of humans get treated
so you d- well , the animals can do work , they can be work animals , but it's different to have them , uh , I guess uh , okayay so I wouldn't agree with the , or , you know , in this , taking this stance , I wouldn't necessarily , I think they go too far in saying that animals should be removed from labs and factories and stuff , but they should be free from suffering , that is what is the argument , that it's one thing to have them work , it's another thing to slaughter them or keep them in cages where they can't move and stuff
so you're fine with like , animal testing and stuff
yeah
you have no objection to that
well , it depends what you're testing , I guess , but yeah , ultimately , yeah , there's no way , yeah , well it depends how strong of a stance you take you know taking a hard line stance that these animals well I guess the- if you test things that are bad for them then you also should be rewarding them somehow , is the argument that uh , and if the tests
what about lab rats that are specifically bred to have a higher instance of cance
well if it's going to help solve cancer in humans , then from a purely selfish standpoint , we should do it , and I would be inclined to agree with the selfish standpoint but but the the point of this I guess is , is it moral though , because I would be willing to do it if it's immoral but ultimately helpful , but it might still be immoral to do that
well it's not like , it's not like what they did during the Holocaust and the concentration camps
have you ever read about those surgeons who were basically like tearing little kids up to see how they worke
yeah that's really pretty horrible but /
it's not like we're doing that
well there are some places where we might be doing that to animals , I wouldn't be surprised , I mean I'm sure that there's plenty of really awful stuff that's done to animals or at least that used to be , I think that animals rights groups have gained some level of , of , uh , moderation for that
but cause they I mean they are animals rights groups that actually are powerful , like PETA or other ones like that
well I'm not saying at all that we need to take a step back and say more cruelty to animals , I'm not doing anything like that
I think where we have now maybe a little bit more regulation on animal rights would be okay , but anything radical I think is , I don't think is feasible
well let's I mean the question is , are animals in fact in you know relatively intelligent things comparatively to lower organisms , that suffer , you know
are they similar , like mammals , are mammals similar to humans enough so that maybe it's okay to test on insects and stuff or uh bacteria but
well true so
you can't test , like , you can't run a medical test on a bacteria , you can't
so let's
well , I mean , uh , no , you actually can run a medical test on a bacteria
you're testing whether an antibiotic works , but you can't test whether or not the instance of cancer would be higher in a certain breed of um
okay , yeah , but what about this then
would it be justifiable , okay , so , we're going to say that we have a moral standard , which says that we should not hurt-harm animals , but even less we should harm humans , and we can harm animals if it would help humans
is that what we're sayin
I guess
or do we just not care about the animal harm to begin wit
well we don't want animals to be harmed if it's avoidable , we don't- we're not going to kill animals in the streets just for fun
well actually , you probably would kill animals in the streets , just cause they really should not be there , but that's a different matter
okay , but so obviously you don't want to just kill animals for fun but would it be justifiable to say that any animal could be used if it's expedient at all for some human purpose and if you're saying that
within reason
well , okay , within reason , sure , but
if , obviously
it's a slippery slope
obviously this would never actually be useful , but if electrocuting a cat every day contributed extremely slightly to a cure for AIDS , I think that's a little bit in the wrong
you think that's in the wrong
yeah cause even though
but
it's really like a cost-benefit type thing , with the cost being the amount of , um , benefit , uh , no , the cost being the amount of pain done to an animal
well I'm definitely partial to the cost-benefit model for anything , and I think it works well here too , but what about this then , would it be justified to kill fifteen people , fifteen innocent people , to cure a disease and save fourteen people
that depends , I think that really depends on , in the first place , are these people themselves suffering from the diseas
um
do we know tha
uh , yeah they are
they are suffering and so are these other fourteen
yeah
okay , well that's obviously a point for that it's advisable to allow them to die , obviously the next part is are they doing this willingl
no , they're it's uh , unwilling for some large percentage of them
it's five people
what's a large percent of five peopl
uh
I'm gonna say either three or four
four
so , four of them do not want to die even though they're going to anyway
yeah , or yeah well , it might not be a fatal disease it it can kill you , but it wont guarantee you to die
but the other fourteen are definitely going to die
yes , because their disease has pr- advanced to the final stage that actually kills you , and the other five people that they want to kill , their disease is still in the early stages so they're not necessarily going to die at all
well , I think this is a bit of an odd example , because there are a lot of questions I'd have to lookay at in a specific instance that I don't really anyone could say in such a hypothetical example , like , why can't we use some of the fourteen people who are going to die anyway , instead of the five
because there are two stages to the disease and only we need to kill five people in the first non-le , nonfatal stage to save the fourteen people in the final lethal stage
so
or fatal
so , these fourteen people are definitely going to die and those five people may or may not die
right , but we're going to guarantee their deaths to guarantee the lives of fourteen
but you guarantee the lives of the fourtee
well we don't guarantee the lives
how do you guarantee that this cure is going to be successfu
we don't guarantee it
it's a ninety eight percent that it will be successful
but these five will certainly die
yes
but those five also could've died
they might die
and based on the data they die about half the time
so two and a half of them are going to die
in theory , yeah , so is , does that mean the solution is to kill half of the
there are five people
so kill two of them and then chop off one of the guys' limbs
in a lot of instances sometimes that's just fitting anyway
laughs
but I think in this instance you kind of need to jut let those five say if they don't want to die , and they're , and they're like , and they have a fifty fifty shot you can't kill them
okay , so let's do the whole situation with animals , except you don't know if the animals are willing to die or not , and you're just going to kill some animals to save other animals
let's just assume that there are no humans and you have no way of knowing if those animals would justifiably die , want to die , but can't you assume that any creature doesn't want to di
I don't think so
I don't think with the majority of animals you can even say there is a want
so you don't think animals have desire
I think they have desires in the form of base instinct
okay
I don't think they have enough comprehension to say , well , to even deal with a hypothetical
well but wouldn't you agree that to a certain extent humanity is just instinct plus intelligenc
I mean don't people do things a lot because of their instincts even if they might rationalize it post fact
but how can do you seriously think a lab rat has a grasp of a hypothetical situation what if it were to di
uh , no , but just because you don't have a conception o something bad that can happen to you , doesn't mean you don't want bad things to happen to you
so we're dealing with a creature that does not understand what it is to die , does not understand that it might die , and we're expecting to assume for it its stance on whether or not it would die for the greater good
well I would argue two things to counteract that , what you said
um , first of all , that it's not that it doesn't understand what it is to die I would argue that it understands what it is to die just as much as a human does
I mean do we really understand what it is to di
well , that's fair
that's fair
plus , um , the thing that it really does understand , which is the key here is pain
that even if it doesn't understand death it certainly understands pain
and wouldn't , we're assuming that
does it hurt thoug
it hurts , yeah
we don't know that it hurts
no , it does
we know that it hurt
it involves removing organs while the creatures alive and
well , why can't you sedate i
so we'll give it anesthetic , righ
but , if we're giving it an anesthetic , then aren't we already kind of saying that we care about how it feel
I mean , if we're giving the animal an anesthetic , then how can we justify killing it to begin wit
don't you only give anesthetics to things that you want to morally protec
that's true
I mean , that's a valid point , but again , this really depends on your own personal sense on a lot of things
this goes a lot deeper
do you believe in the death penalt
do you think that the death penalty is considered cruel and unusual punishmen
personally I think it is but
well I would agree with you on that , but I would also argue that the stance that we share about the death penalty might also necessarily mean that we should support animal rights , or that we should oppose animal cruelty to mammals and stuff
okay , but if you would permit me to take a stance that I don't actually believe in , ends justify the means , so I can support a stance that I do believe in , the death penalty is supported fairly widely in that , um , on the stance that
economic , righ
wha
economi
economic , no
oh okay , go on
um , the death penalty is not in fact cruel or unusual punishment
because it's painles
but torture would be , so therefore we have to state that there's a distinction , at least in U
s
law , between death , and um
and pai
homicide , essentially and torture
we have to say that death for the purposes of U
s
law specifically is not painful and not torturous
well I don't know if it matters so much the law as what the U
s
does , and they do torture you know
well that's a different matter
but when the I mean
whether or not they do torture they're not actually allowed to
yeah I know but they're not allowed to because its politically unpopular to allow things like that , but I would argue that the United States government supports torture and the death penalty for exactly the same reasons , that they don't really care about individual human lives
okayay , um
and that by the same token
what you said before there is an economic side a lot of people are pretty much condemned to death because it's just not economically fitting
I believe that an average human in general calculations is calculated at like seven million dollars
yeah okay economically speaking the death penalty is expedient but
I'm not talking about the death penalty I'm talking about like reactions
um , cost-benefit again
would you save these peopl
is it economically soun
uh , well we'll say it is
there , maybe it wasn't seven million maybe it was like seventeen million , I don't remember , I actually do for some reason remember that there was a seven involved
okay
but when calculating whether or not you should intervene to save lives , the value of a human life is calculated and recalculated
okay , but umm , the argument against the death penalty and against torture would be , that that individual human lives are somehow special or that should that they should be protected as a constraint on our behavior
so in other words , what , you know , what's the morality that we're gonna say the death penalty is based on
you know , like there may be an economic reason , we both know that the death penalty is economically sound because otherwise , you have to imprison these people , and that's expensive
but the reason why I would be opposed to the death penalty is because I don't trust the government to make the determination of guilt , because they get it wrong so often
that's true
personally , I just think that regardless of the cost , I think that denying someone their life is just against everything that aside from basic human rights , which it obviously violates
I just think that this is a violation of everything that the government and the country stands for
well I agree , but then I guess I am , there is sort of an impasse between that and animal right , because well would you agree that retarded people or very very stupid people should be treated with the same human right
the same human rights , yeah
and , there're definitely dumb people who are less intelligent than chimpanzees
uh , well , yeah
I mean they do exist they might not be very common , but there definitely are people who have the intellectual capacity not even as much as an animal
a lot of those people are , it's a little hard to find people like that , a lot of them are in permanent vegetative states
well , okay , fine
well even then , some of those are killed
yeah , true , well , that's another one I guess
I mean the whole vegetative state thing
well I don't know what I would decide in a situation like that
oh , well , I mean , I certainly wouldn't tell anyone to pull my personal plug but if someone requested that their plug be pulled , well , I'd be cool with it
oh , yeah , but what if , well , do you support , do you think people have the right to suicid
yeah , definitely
so you don't think there's even if someone's not necessarily in their right mind , you think they should be allowed to kill themselve
uh , if a psychiatrist says they're not in their right mind then no
but how do you , so what do you , go to your local , um , district court , and say I would like to requisition the proper forms to kill mysel
uh yeah that's one way to think about it
and then you have to like make your case , this is my psychiatrist , he says I am of sound mind and should be allowed to shoot mysel
well first of all , I think most people could probably manage to kill themselves and I don't really think they would need to get the permission
so I think that they'd probably be okay with it
the main
but I'm saying
in the case , in the case that you described
this would never happen in practice
well It would happen
I'm saying in your idea , if you're saying that suicide should be legal , which I mean , it's illegal for whatever that's worth
yeah well I'm talking about in the case of someone
but how would you legalize suicid
in the case of someone being hospitalized or imprisoned that wanted to be commit suicide that would be the case where they would have to get the forms
like in the case where you're under the protective care of the state or of a hospital or something , or psychiatric ward or whatnot
well then that becomes assisted suicide
it's not assisted you just need permission to kill yourself
but for someone to pull your plug , that's assisted suicide
yeah that is , and in that case you need the forms
but I would argue the same thing applies for a suicide where you're not actually ill
like if you're in a psychiatric hospital or if you're in a prison
if you just want to commit suicide cause you're unhappy , then that should be allowed
so you think prisoners should be able to apply for the death penalt
yeah , and think a lot of them would take it
but then where do you see the line that they're not in their right min
uh , the not in the right mind , well a prisoner is different , because I would argue that being in the prison system is a kind of cruel and unusual punishment or a torture in and of itself , just because prisoners don't have very many rights and they aren't treated well , and you know whatever horror stores about rape and so on
but I would argue that offering death is sort of a necessary humane thing for prison , and for hospitals , you know , the pulling the plug assisted suicide thing , if you're suffering , you should be able to stop suffering
I think suffering is worse than death
in a lot of cases , it's hard to judge suffering , and no one knows what it is to die who's around to tell you what its like
right , which is why I would rather have a mystery over a guaranteed bad thing
well sometimes the evil you know is better than the evil you don't know
that is a saying , but I am not necessarily sure that I agree with that at all
you don't think that's ever the cas
well it could be the case , but the evil you don't know assumes that you know that it is in fact evil
something after death could be good
or if there is an after death it's probably nothing , in my opinion , obviously
I'm just saying , uh , it's not the evil you don't know it's the , you don't know you don't know
but it could be evil
but also could be good
but just as easily evil , that's why it's the evil you don't know
but it's not the evil you don't know , because that assumes that it already you know it's gonna be some evil you don't know
no , that's just the expression
well I only buy the expression that applies in the case that you know it's evil , otherwise an unknown is better than a known bad
but the whole point of the expression is that you don't know what it is , but it very well could be worse
yes which it could be and it's a good word of advice to make sure that you know that he evil you know is really that bad
yeah
but if that's bad you might really want to just go
it depends you know
but if it's so what if it's so easily worse , that's what the saying is trying to get across
but what are really the chances that death could be worse than tortur
I think that kind of depends on whether or not you see the torture ongoing
if someone has a life sentence and if they consider their life sentence a day of torture every day
exactly
maybe they're better off dead
that would be the case I refer to
if they've got parole in twenty years , then I think they're making a rash decision killing themselves
well I think it's okay if people make rash decisions , that's fine
people make rash decisions to do lots of stupid things all the time and we don't
well to kill yourself , that's a little final
yeah I know , but eventually it'll weed itself out of the gene pool
then you're getting into something completely different
yeah I know , uh , well , let's go back to animals though
I think our gene pool sucks enough already , like just walk down the street and tell me how many people are doing something good for the gene pool
wait , say that again
I think the human gene pool is pretty bad already
oh , yeah
if you could just walk down the street and tell me how many people are doing something positive for the gene pool
good point
it doesn't lookay good
yeah good point
um , but let's go back to the animals though
okay , okay , yeah we've gotten a little off topic
I'm pretty sure that there are there're , uh , some level of rights and protections granted to great apes and dolphins and stuff
because they're deemed humanoid in one way or another
yeah , but isn't it a spectru
I mean , aren't all mammals kind of like humans , like , I mean , we definitely share a lot of genetic material and stuff
I don't think we're in the best place to decide where , but there is a line somewhere that dictates basically what's human enough , because if you say that everything is to some degree human , then why draw the line at mammals , maybe birds , hydras , hydras are technically animals , if a hydra is , then why not a protozoa , which is an animal-like protist
then , why not any other protist , then why not any other bacteria , there's a line somewhere , there is definitely a line
okay , but why are we drawing the line and what's the rationale for drawing it where we have i
the line right now is the line at which we think , maybe the lines a little off center , where we think these animals can understand their own situation in the sense that they're sentient
uh , well I guess the question is , is sentience relativ
I mean can you be , is there , just you're sentient or not , or can it be you're kind of self aware , kind of sentient , I mean I definitely know some people who seem less sentient than others
well , yeah , I think that any human , well , not any human if we're going back to the vegetative and the disabled , mentally disabled , no offense to anyone in wheelchairs , I'm not going to say they're worse off than apes , I think that a chimp is less sentient than a human hands down
okay I agree but so then
hell
hell
uh , I'm trying to phrase this
couldn't you then say , I mean , so we're drawing the sentience line arbitrarily right now , I mean what about
we're trying it relative to ourselves
we see our own sentience as our ability to think abstractly , to uh , think of a hypothetical , and to well , I mean there are tons of tests for sentience , there's the mirror test can you get the animal to lookay at itself in the mirror and recognize it , as its own body and its own movements
before to come up with the idea
yeah /
then after I used the methods to test that design then you just keep iterating on that
yeah
so you're supposed to use like keystroke level modeling and stuff to test our idea /
and U_A_Rs
and that's like supposed to support that our idea is a good idea for collaborative shopping
so actually I guess like that we should just look through the model answers to the models and then we can like identify the key areas to work it and we can build our stuff from there
what are we supposed to like do for our keystroke level modeling thoug
are we supposed to compare it to the keystroke level modeling that we did before , because /
I guess we can
technically when we did that homework they said that it wasn't for collaborative shopping
yeah
so , I guess , yeah , we can just like have some sketches of our final product and just put it in Cog_Tool and compare it against everything else that we have there
mmhmm
I think it would //
it's going to be hard to like top google notebook
or the right click context menu
yeah , like
yeah but see , if you make it //
you can offer a feature google notebook doesn't
that justify /
even if it's a little bit longer , it would justify using our method instead of that too
that's true
I think that's what we are supposed to do
even if it's not faster than google notebook , it would be something that's like community based
yup
yeah
yeah , its go //
its gotta let them you know //
it's not only about buying a couch , it's more about building a community apparently
I feel with like the google notebook all it really does is a //
like all it does is allow you to like takes a where the page is and then it just and a note
yeah , it just like link and then subtext there
yeah
so , yeah I mean we could just argue that it takes really like small amount of time to like put stuff on the google notebook , but like the entire couch buying process is not limited to just , you know , putting the list together but you actually have to go through them /
and discuss
but yeah discuss you know like maybe list them by price or like sort them by price or something like that
so , it's only like a small portion
I feel like , yeah
you could argue that the time it takes longer
it talks about the group meeting time
do we need to like set up a group meeting time with like Bonnie or Joh
umm , it's in like two weeks or so , they'll have another sign up thing
it's one of the mandatory times
so , wait , is it we'll have a sign up thing in two weeks or do we have to meet with them in two week
I can bring up the schedule
is the final report , the thing that's worth twenty percen
yes
okay
and that's due tomorro
no
n
oh , okay
it's due December third
then what's due tomorro
nothing
oh , okay , wow
I totally thought that it was due tomorrow so oh my God
but we wanna get started now so that we don't panic towards the end
so basically what they said was you guys don't have homework for two weeks , so you guys should start working on homework six
yeah , yeah
okay
did we had three homeworks so far or fou
we had three
yeah , there's four and five at some point
yes
one's a think aloud and the other's the cognitive walkthrough
yes
homework three was Cog_Tool
and cognitive walkthrough is November fifth
and our group meeting is November tenth
so are they going to talk about cognitive walkthrough tomorro
umm
because I probably will not be able to go to that
no , the subject for tomorrow , like I know one of them is speed dating which is Wednesday
and tomorrow was //
I know I read the paper on it that we had to read and it was about umm favorite objects
and stuff and how like people and like how some cultures are attached to their favorite objects and what they mean and what makes them a favorite object
I need to go to the DMV and get my learner's permit
get my
yeah , looks like the topic for tomorrow is products and services slash design for self
there's no reading though
uh , there is they put is on umm /
it's not on the syllabus schedule
it's on blackboard
and they also have a new schedule on blackboard
ah , yeah
it just says TBA but yeah it is on blackboard under the folder
okay , so ah
so , it looks like we need an idea and some evidence supporting our idea by our
yeah , so I guess we can look through the model that they provided , the correct model
the correct model
then we can figure out like exactly which aspect we
it seems like a good idea like I don't //
remember when we went through in class we talked about like role strain and there's like a lot of role sharing 'cause they each have to this this
we would want to build something that supports that
and reduce double work
yes
key phrase
double work
it's more economical
and tomorrow's October twenty-seven
there's nothing on like this new scheduling even
it says to be announced but it's under every file for every lecture they have /
I know but like
they suck at //
I'm going to check
so , it seems like google notebook is kind of what our original idea was in a way
like it saves the link and then you can put a comment
yeah
so why was John so against i
John wanted us to build community
apparently google notebook does not
oh my God
do we call something community notebook /
but it's the most efficient
it java that's the word really in the title no less
are we meeting with Bonnie next tim
yes please
please , yeah
I mean some people who met with John
like Alyssa was , they met with John and they were like oh yeah , he was so nice to us
dude , the guy forgot that we had five members in our group
he mentioned like you forgetting his name
uh , so I uh hi
what are you like /
aren't you the guy that teaches the clas
yeah
yeah , I saw you are you the T
are you Aruna's T
okay , so I guess like on here it says even though John and Bonnie are reading this we have to make it like not with the HCI jargon
yeah , you have to make it like /
or at least like explain it to a regular audience
act like this is like you know a project that a company like or like work for a client
so , do we //
should we like decide an idea firs
I think that would probably be a good idea
like go through ideas that support what we've found in the
so , are we going to like go through ideas and see which one is most supported by the work that we've done so far
yeah , yeah
maybe we should start by kind of going through the models and seeing like //
kind of what we were doing in class , seeing what the problems were like role strain , role sharing , umm , where all the breakdowns are
and also that really can like you know figure out //
can get a very narrow target where on and everything else
yeah , we can work on like //
I guess this would be the part where we have technology that we are trying to find where it goes in the
yeah
this wiki is like private , righ
yeah
okay
okay , let's look at
the name of , oh flow model that's it
what , uh
I should have brought the homework
it's on the slides
which lecture is it i
number eight
ah , there there ah
model solution to the model problem
which //
ah
number eight
no no no , like which lectur
methods of making
I've been counting
hhh
I just watched the office last night
okay
so should we like focus on ah
these are nice
I like the colors
uh , should we like focus on the breakdown
they said don't only look at breakdowns
yeah , okay
so , I guess the first thing that caught my eye was like the the part about verbal planning , preference , price , age and status where they were like uh , where they would just sit down and talk about the couches they've seen and stuff
so I mean that's a good starting point that we can build on and from there add the rest of the crap and other stuff
so we want to replicate //
it's kind of like replicating what they do in real life but we give it more efficient and /
we'll have to make it so that when they are not home they can still express /
yeah and not their conversation
that's community
so we should like let them put in their like preferences before hand
I get the //
yeah I guess //
yeah I mean
and then like could be like a page where you can like at a glance see what people want
we're supposed to support all shopping , correc
not just couch shoppin
yeah
okay
well yeah , I mean it would be kind of awkward if there was like a if there was like a page that only supports couch shopping /
couch shopper dot com
you can basically you know //
you can basically like have a
like a say for whatever they're buying like if they're buying a table right now
so , they start a kitchen table shopping session and then every basically says uh before we start looking these are my likes and dislikes for a kitchen table
key it in and then uh so everyone at a glance here can see basically what people are looking for and what they are not looking for
do we wanna make it like qualitative or like quantitative like preference
do just wanna people like answer in like I don't know like in three four or do /
I think we can enter in free form and do the same thing use natural language processing technology to figure it out
yeah , see like where's the line between like what is possible and like what is technically possible /
well , I know NLP is technically possible
but what is like feasibly possible given our like /
I feel like free form might be a little hard
like people might forget to like put things in that they feel is important while /
we could like have certain like questions like what is your price rang
to me its like certain categories , right , and then whether this is a what you want in the couch or what you want in the product or don't want
yeah , you could have like plus minuses
that's a problem like stuff for price
wha
like when you got uh
okay for price lists and stuff there should like be a price range right rather than just
and usually price ranges are better
yeah , okay
so it's an idea
yeah , you wanna go /
did we ever like go through the ideas on the wik
yeah , we can go through them
we were going to but then had that meeting with John
yeah , the community meeting
wait no , on this wiki like /
yeah , we haven't haven't gone through it
that was we made this after the meeting with John
after the meeting
hhh yeah , that's why you put like community
all the community stuff
yeah
I was just reading Dave's and digital affinity diagram representations like he just put in like all the buzz words we can remember digital affinity diagram representation
we can probably make some features of our system too that you like don't have to use but if you choose to use it like it will make it easier
like something you you can say the space you have to put the couch in
that way like it will check the dim //
like if you want to search for couches you can like put the dimensions in and be like will it fit in this space
but like none of the couches umm I mean guess not none but like /
some of the couches on craigslist had had the dimensions
the stuff on Macy's definately had the dimensions
yeah , I mean you could just parse it
have like interns like parse this code
I mean technically the person could just like , if they wanted to check the dimensions could just like type them in themselves and the computer would then like check if it fit in the space or
so , so like having users entering in their preferences is like the main ide
yeah
I was thinking like each user can designate like five top preferences and then for each one like for each of their ratings their own ratings
they can like base it upon their preferences instead of //
I don't know it's kind of hard visualize I think but
I mean like in an ideal word world you can just like rate your preferences and then you know the thing would automatically go through all the results and like pick the best couches for you
but the thing is like the repeat //
I mean its just like John would be against this because as you look through the couches your preferences would probably change personally in like non deterministic way
well , he'd also say it's that it's not supporting communities because your not getting to know your roommates by looking at the couches they don't like which kind of gives you an insight into who they are
well , what what if the system just does the community work for yo
like it , I don't know because it knows /
afterwards it would give a report of this person likes this type of stuff by analyzing how they rated couches
you know like ma maximize the you know total happiness or like min minimize the total sadness
it's like It's like pandora or something
a bunch of couches just show up and you're like yes no yes no and then it'll /
yeah , based on your selection this is the kind of person you are
you are a psycho
yeah
okay , so what kind of like preferences do we want users to have to enter i
price range
yeah , because we have to make sure they're they can like go across all products too
like ah uh , you know what we can d
you know like how in the cultural model , we can just base like the preferences on like the cultural model because people like care about these stuff , you know it's in the model dude , you kno
they /
they're definitely influencing preferences
yeah , so price like you bought you duh really
uh , locatio
slash distance I guess
or we can put it as like location or shipping options or transportation options
cause if you're like buying off like Macy's they'll deliver if for you
yeah , you don't really care where the Macy's is that's delivering it
you just care whether or not how much the delivery is and when they deliver
so how would you enter that i
would there be like a check box I okay with being having it shippe
or you can say umm /
like who would be against like getting a couch shipped anywa
if the shipping cost too much and you can are within driving distance
like I guess someone's gonna /
but is that like isn't it like combine in the pric
if you buy from Macy's doesn't it show you the price
to ship it
it doesn't show you with the shipping
the shipping is added on
another issue we have to have though like with letting them enter their preferences is we can't really //
John's like well Aruna has allergies and she says she won't get a one with a cat but then she's actually willing to compromise and get one with a cat
but then we could just as Annie said we could just have them rate their like preferences
but then she might end up rating it really high on the preference list because you know it's it's an allergy but she'll still but she'll still compromise at the end
but that could be a factor
yeah , she k /
she keeps saying that she won't get one with a cat but then like her actions later
yeah , like now you say that I'm wondering if even having them entering their preferences , does it help the community buildin
or does it actually hur
so you know how like people enter //
like think about this you know how we enter so much info about you know facebook
you meet someone but you like actually know like what kind of music they like
you know everything about them
there's like less to talk about
you can't really say you like the kind of music because you read it on her thing
so its gotta be like really clear that you stalked that person
so you get to act like
are you talking from experienc
no speaking there was an XKCD comic that made me think of it
umm , so
so like what if //
okay , so if each user had five like five preferences and then each of the preferences they can rate with like five stars say , so then it'll it'll each add up to like twenty-five total per like item and then say like the system will just sort through everyone's like numbers and then figure out like what's at the top
wait , where the hell were
no , no , no
they will add up everyone's number like per item
but
but that would mean they would have to look at the same items
but what happens if their preferences are differen
like you can't like yeah
be , well the thing is like it's okay if their preferences are different
like
but then you end up with getting data from some people and not getting data from others
like if , if Aruna was the only one with allergies and she's the only one with allergies as a preference then she would rather not have something with cats and no one else puts down uh that they have a problem with cats
yeah , you would be comparing apples and oranges
yeah , you would only have one data point instead of five
oh crap I'm speaking with a stats
but I think that like price is like you know like quantitative enough that we can actually like
I think price and location
those this I thought should be just separate like because it seems like that's something everyone would like care about
yeah , so like /
like I think it should just be like a thing you can filter or sort by
sort by price or by like distance
or and then like maybe filter by method of delivery
you know what it could d
if other people enter in like price and like location thing , so while you visit like craigslist , it could just like show you next to every item , be like Aruna would like this couch because it fits like in her price range
or like if if something doesn't fit , it could just like like it could show a red I don't know cross and be like this couch is I don't know not in Aruna's price range so it would just like not look at that one
okay , well but then then again like when Aruna can compromise
yeah , because the thing is that she only compromises when because it is a group decision
if she's the one buying the couch then allergies rank really really high
yeah , but 'cause yeah , because even when cat when Kate came in and started talking about oh this couch is nice but oh it's got cats then Aruna's like oh
well , Aruna's like well maybe because it has cats and a little damage we can you know , compromise to get the price lower
jeff was like I don't like that
so , like , it's kind of hard like unless they actually meet together , like buy the thing like , just like get together as a group , it's kind of hard to like unless they have like real time discussion
how are we going to like simulate tha
build a community around this
well , could you do something like how google notebook , how you record the site or the link or whatever and then you can put a comment but then like within our site you can like search a key word and it will bring up all of the links that people have posted with that key word in the comment
so you can see like what she says like I like the color and price or whatever
then if you type in color or something you can see like what couches people mentioned
but like what if she says I don't like the colo
it's going to come up with /
yeah , but then you get to at least see that she doesn't like this color and you can see which ones she does like the color and which ones she doesn't like the color so when you are looking you have the knowledge of oh Aruna's /
or you gotta have like two different like tagging fields like positive negative and you can just like drag color into positive
then that will take time
fitt's law
but it would be like really convinient
because then you actually have to drag stuff into boxes
rather than telling someone , hey , I don't like that color
which one's faster , entering it in or like dragging i
it depends on how big the box and target you're looking at
you are the equation
but what if people just prefer dragging though no matter how long it take
the we have to study that
uh , where I guess we can have positive and negative fields
it's a good idea
wait so , are we making the users enter in their preferences beforehan
I think that that's a good idea
uh , what are like the preferences we're havin
price range
well it seems like because each item that they might be shopping for could be drastically different it seems like we have to let them , as a community , which preferences they want
so , it's not going to be set
but like , okay , we have to have like a set of preferences that they'll pick from
yeah , basic all like when
but why thoug
but like how how are we gonna how are we gonna have people entering in their preferences if we don't like set up the stuff for the
like say , say like
they're not programmers
they're not able to
each person enters in five top preferences and then those , er , wait , I don't know and then you consolidate it into a list and then they'll like figure out which one's most important which one's least important
but like think of it like though , implementing the perspective like
it'll just be by the value
you know , like you could designate price as like ten and then location as nine blah blah blah and then depending on the importance it can probably be bigger
but like if you don't set up the uh , implementation for entering in the price range
like suppose that there's nothing set up like how how is a not programmer person going to be able to like set up a preference and have it like implemented in the thin
like am I making sens
like /
yeah , you're talking about having predefined stuff versus uh something new that you have to code up
yeah , you have to have like some sort of options that their like gonna pick from
could we like technically just not have them do preference
'cause I mean , like if they leave a comment , obviously you don't have to leave a comment
but if they do decide to leave a comment they're probably going to mention why they dislike or liked a couch and within that like if someone says that they like the price you can go to that couch and see the price that they liked and be like okay , they like at least /
so that's like google notebook then
it is like google notebook slightly but we have to like umm , change it to make it more community based
well , you can umm , compilate preferences on the fly based on selection
yeah , that's possible
so if a like say if you bought if you looked at a couch and you rated it maybe a two out of five the its gonna lo then is gonna so so
it's gonna look to the page to find the price
look through the page find the key points , try to correlate that with other choices you've made in the past and then when someone else is looking at that page , you know , you can have like maybe a small bar on the top that says you know ah , like John would like this , Annie might not like this based on past references
the only problem with that is that it's it doesn't give you a list of what the people are looking for
could you /
but it could like , you can once you figure out what people like you can just make it like spit out like you know how pandora does
just like John prefers couches like you can say like according to my calculations
john prefers couches within this price range
he prefers couches around Shadyside and this color
that way the problem with that approach right , generating the list of preferences based purely on observation is that what happens if I show you a really really cheap couch that you would like based on price but you hate the color and to you color ranks more than price , righ
so , you rank , you rate it like a two out of five even though if it was a color that you liked you would have rated it a five
so right now the system would look at it and say he doesn't like this couch because the price is two hundred is one hundred dollars and the color is green
so you end up with false data
couldn't you do somethign like /
could you also support the explicit data entr
well , you can , I guess
you just need to figure out how it fits into the work flow
well , what about something like you know google notebook how you can highlight the link and then click the add button
well , what if you could also have other features where you could like highlight the price and then there would be a dropdown list and you can say price and then it will record that price
like so instead of having to enter something like manually , the things you like about it , or dislike about it you can be like , it will have a drop down menu and you can be like like and then it will have another dropdown menu and you can be like price and then you could like highlight the color and be like dislike and then like color
that would be kind of cool
like that would be really cool
it would be really time consuming but it would probably be faster than entering the data trhough keystrokes
it wouldn't be that time consuming either , like , you could just have something like you know , once you like once you highlight this it just shows like like and dislike
and then you click on one of them and it has everything
it's like , you don't have to like click , you can just pull your mouse over the /
yeah , kind of like any thing like up here
it has /
yeah , kind of like up here where it has like and arrow and then you can click on one of these
yeah
you can actually save time by not highlighting
just right click over the word and then you can generate an n best list
yeah , yeah
I'm sorry
I'm sorry man
you just said n best list
ok so I'll just record
um
what were we talking abou
I was gonna check the kernal spec
I can't figure out any of them that get past the t_i_d other than
a p_c_p
oh p_c p_i_d
p_i_d yeah sorry
yeah I did a search and there's no p_i_d in the whole thing
like the letters p i d
um
this but
exec yields sleep none of those have p_i_d-s
doesn't have a p_i_d just a status pointer
oh by the way it turns out status is an integer not a
yeah I noticed that
yeah so I changed that
well then what about your t_c_b-s like
t_i_d-
when you're vanishing and you're not the last
yeah
thread
yeah
can't someone try to look you up while your vanishing
yea
um but when do you want to look someone up for yield
as so many times we're passing in a t and castwoi runflag only two times righ
yup
at which point in time what happen
you either get put into a queue um or you're in a queue
but if you're in a queue then you're not in vanish
right
or no you might be in a queu
in which case they just yell to you when you finish vanishing
I'm worried about times when you have to look up somebody
mmhm
and work with them but they're t_c_b-s been freed or something like that
well we remove it from the hashmap before its freed
yeah what if I look it u
then it yields to us or somehow some sort of vanish
or if they're looking it up while we are removing it from the hashma
but then that's just a hashmap block
I think we should definitely lock the hashmap both maps
well
if we wouldn't set up doing the scheduler I suppose if we can't switch out from the scheduler
mmhm
so there's really no waste conditions with the scheduler and other things
actually no there are
because the other processes other processors
yeah
um but the p has a mutex inside of the um scheduler
so we can't lock up the
oh hm
I mean if we use the processor a lot
hm
but
uh definitely think that we should lock it
uh
because if you're in the middle of removing and then you get a timer interupt and someone else tried to yield to you
hm slightly tricky
that was good sushi by the way
thanks
um I mean it wasn't good just delicious
oh ok
um hm so there's really two places we look up t_i_d-s
castwoi and in uh scheduler
schedule
and both are locked both have a processor lock and the other no contact switch lock so in this case all we have to worry about is other processors doing stuff at the same time
mmhm
so what if we lock the add and the remove with a processor lock
I'm fine with that
um
the only thing is if we lock add or remove with a processor loc
yeah
um when we go to remove uh we haven't been through the scheduler yet so we're not like scheduling locked and so we get a processor lock on that remove and that map righ
mmhm
and then we go to uh we get a timer interupt which then tries to schedule
we also I we also have the disabled context switch
we also do dis so we disable context switch during any operations to the
I'm tempted to always link those together but there are cases where you don't really link them together
but yeah yeah in that case they would be grouped together so we need a functional law
yeah that would be fine for that
eh I'm really okay with it
okay
yeah
um do you interface a bunch of fails with vanishe
standardin n
because the errors that I've been running into with Simics now you know just during debugging
I haven't really started to debug yet
I took me a bit of time to get everything up
I mean I do have a bunch of vanishes like in the exception handlers
in exception handlers okay that could
in the page fault general protection fault all the exceptions um except for page fault all the other exceptions will kill the process which includes a vanish
yeah because um Simics when it crashes there's it's a triple fault handler and them some like i_d_t like two hundred seventy or something like that
some really high number
really
and I'm like huh
wait is i
maybe two hunrded and thirty
triple fault reall
um so
yes it does vanish inside of exception file exception handler
but that's so weird that it would treat
slightly weird
oh something else is um
I'm thinking hang on this are t_c_b and p_c_b the design decisions for those have they been locked dow
mmhm
we kinda have code around that you know that initializes them and changes values
and that feels slightly dangerous
okay
I don't know
I mean its not so many that I feel like we actually needed like initialize t_c_b thing but
it just
like right now t_c_b-s are only created in two places thread fork and the initial
not thread fork just fork
t_c_b-
oh you said b_c_p-s
sorry I meant to say t_c_b
okay
t_c_b-s are in uh third fork and
and the initial
initial and p_c_b-s are in fork and initial
right
and that's probably not going to change
hm
okay
that's cool
das ist cool
hm
yeah that shouldn't change
triple fault that's weird
because like there's a bunch of different things that could cause a triple fault but
hm
I mean the weird thingy is that it's it seems like its trying to access uh the index the i_u_t is using ≋
mhmm
is way out of bounds not way out of bounds but its like two hundred and something
which is not
is it two two somethin
wait is it an i_d_
did it say i_d_t or does it say like l_d_t or g_d_
i_d_t
and does it say general protection faul
maybe
yeah that's my code prints out general protection fault uh that means that someone sent a int with the i_d_t out of range
yeah yeah that's right
and that i_d_t is printed in hex
it's in he
oh that's really out of range then
yeah I think that's I'm not sure where that's coming from
I think it might be coming from a vanish
is it two two zer
I think so yeah
that's coming from
is it whenever you call shel
or whenever you set up the in
I was getting the exact same thing
alright
I was getting
well
I don't know which one that was from
I initially I was the one that set up the p_c_b correctly in um the initial setup
okay
so anything and actually no it would get it
it was weird what happened was
so I forgot I didn't do that correctly
so I didn't setup who the queues correctly
mmhm
and uh I would get into a infinite loop in the memory management where it would uh it would get the p_d_e
mmhm
and then it would check it to see its valid
and it would dereference it
that would cause page fault
and eventually that would
and it would skip the call to p_d_e
ah because it tries to dereference a p_d_e which the p_d_e should be in kernal memory but we don't check
I should check and make sure the p_d_e is in kernal memory
okay
that's what the problem is there
I mean fixing the init is fix that
maybe we should make a note of that just so we don't forget it
yeah
we should like record our conversations you know
so that we can just play them back later as notes
yeah we should definitely listen to them
that's true
rip off Megan having to listen to us now
hi Megan
um
dududu
lets vote and just
oh woah
that guy just did an amazing dive
oh so the i_d_e check in to make sure its in bound
p_d_e
oh p_d_e sorry
p_d_e
okay
yeah I should probably go over page faults with a fine tune comb
so that we make sure that everything is safe
you don't run end up in an infinite loop like that
I'm trying to nap safe for now
like I checked stock
I check t_c_b in there
one to get its p_c_b I check its p_c_b
yeah
min
we should make a corrupted kernel stack or something like that uh just to like check
mmhm
because this seems to be like common checks like check t_c_b then p_c_b maybe even throwing in a canary in too
a canar
um a static integer where you put at the beginning of a structure
oh
and at the end of the structure just to make sure it hasn't been written over
that's interesting
I've never heard of that
what would we define it to b
just something really weird that wouldn't come up normally
well that might not come up normally
it would just be a random integer
hm
like canaries in the land mine or uh not land mine
in a
in a yeah
man I wish that uh
was that hexidecimal that you used for the seventee
because then you could spell Gabe
dead Gabe
or Gabe beef
Gabe beef that'd be cool
um
yeah
yeah
so the like seventy pages of Japanese culture reading I did last night
uhhuh
turned out to be the wrong reading
oh no
I mean it was necessary
its just we were supposed to read an article or something for today
uhhuh
so oh well
oops
it took me seven hours
I can't read
anyway so um
I know the feeling I can't do any of that kind of stuff
so if I have two mutexes and wait no
I added one mutex and one semafor
there already was one mutex for page the pages in the p_c_b
yes
I added the mutex for queue
okay
you know to for adding those queues and added a semafor which is signal in you know in vanish
yeah
um yeah and that seemed to make sense
when I add somebody's when someone's when I read chil
mmhm
um I add its semafor to ours
okay
I go through each of the lists and I change each of the children's parent to b_s
oh okay
and then I add them onto our lists
okay that makes sense
not in that order , but thats basically what I do
yeah
I mean first I change their parent
oh wow , a bunch of stuff is an illegal memory reference now
yeah the we have to explicitly check for null
when we compute the address of a struct and stuff like that
oh my god
also , he thought about that case that I was saying that array
right
where if you allocate like an array of arrays
okay
and you get a bunch of null array pointers that's invalid so
yeah
yeah so whenever we
so in the IR there are a bunch of places where I get the address of something
and after I get that we just have to check for null
well
you can just read from the address to do an implicit check
I guess
you can
like a compare
yeah
there might even be an instruction cuz it's six eighty six like check this address
oh like die if it's null
yeah
um
whatever we can do that in the end
what was that case you were talking about using a conditional move for
um for array bounds checking
so like instead of doing index is less than zero jump to thing that seg faults do compare
and then like compare with zero
and then C move less than something into dereferencing null
oh okay yeah
so if it's less than zero it'll try to move something at to into null
otherwise it'll be fine
and that will make the control flow a lot better
okay
it'll also make the instructions shorter
right
um
that's why it it'll be much more efficient if we don't have it completely in the IR
oh also allocation with new tau of N for N less than zero must fail
what what does it do now if you try to do that
like new int brackets minus one
it'll
what does it do
I think so it it'll just it'll call calloc with minus one
oh wouldn't it
but calloc is
calloc is a signsig
signsig it's is unsigned , isn't i
so that would be
so it would be something ginormous
yeah
it would be ≋
hhh
the max int
okay
uh which is
two to the thirty one minus one
at least
well
times the size of the object so for an int if you do new int minus one it would be sixteen gigs and that would just fail
well no sixteen gigs can't
oh no size T is sixty four bits isn't it
no he said it was thirty two
what
I thought it was the machine word size
well in the handout it said that we should assume that size T is unsigned int
that doesn't make a whole lotta sense
I know but that's what he said
I'm pretty sure that's wrong actually
it could be
I remember I tried looking once
anyway um so this array layout stuff that we've already pretty much figured that out
um so I guess the implication is that the typechecker should catch extern functions with array return types
cuz that doesn't go
I think so
there's a whole section on that
it just the array layout section
yeah
it just says arrays generated by C cannot be returned to L five
blah dee blah
so it doesn't say what to do
so it's unspecified
it doesn't say what to do about it
so it's unspecified
yay
unspecified behavior um
right so these optimizations
um most of I say we d ehh huh
we've already done a couple of them
we've already done instruction selection all right
yeah parts of it
wait aligning jump targets
seriously
um generating good code for conditions or loops
aligning jump targets
you can do that with an assembler directive you can be like dot align four
so that doesn't cost us anything so let's just do that
yeah
so anyway we've already done most of that generating good code for conditions and our loops already make sense
um
I dunno if we were really brave we could try like using L E A for certain types of multiplication and addition
yeah that should be it could be a uh final pass thing on the assembly
well it depends on all the operands being registers
so I mean as long as I the code is generated in a consistent manner we can look for certain patterns
right well I mean for something like an expression two times X plus one that can be turned into an L E A but that's like that might not be recognizable in the assembly
yeah I don't know
I'm sure that the register allocation in G C C is really complicated because for s things like that it'll r realize that if those are registers then it can be faster
I don't really want to know how bad G C C is
uh constant folding and propagation I think we should do that one cuz some of the other ones are really nasty dead code elimination we can do that one
common subexpression elimination I don't want to do that
yeah how many do we have to pick from that list
three
so we've already got one of um and I say j I just say we do constant folding and dead code elimination
well we kind of so we have instruction selection but we also kind of have eliminating register moves improve instruction selection
really
well that's like the first thing on the list
well no that's different
there was one thing I did to improve instruction selection for ifs and then the other thing I did to improve instruction selection
oh yeah the munching into a specific thing thing um okay
so we can look at maybe doing register coalescing
whate whatever if it's in the notes then fine but I don't wanna have to figure it out
yeah also size T is long unsigned int
so that's sixty four bits
what is he smoking
I dunno
look on the fish machines
find the file
what it's oh but it has to be sixty four bits
that doesn't make any sense it's like the size of a thing in memory which could be sixty four bits
and like if it's sixty four on mine it'll be sixty four
it does not make any sense
the whole point of sixty four bit is so you can have stuff that's whatever
so then negative one as an unsigned sixty four bit int is what four gigs
terabytes
er no
four gigs squared
no sk squared no it's
it's so minus one interpreted as unsigned is two to the thirty one no it's yeah
two to the sixty five minus one it's sixty four bit
what no minus oh y oh so that's two to the thirty two minus one
sixty four bits of all ones
no it depends on what your it depends on what size the assembler thinks it is cuz doesn't our code just put it in the assembly as minus one
so that would make it sixty four bits of ones wait no it doesn't it passes as a thirty two bit
it passes it as thirty two bits to calloc
yeah
well then it'll be two to the thirty two
minus one times
the size of the stuff
so two to the thirty is one gig
two to the thirty two minus one is about four gigs
so it's four gigs times the size of the thing
yeah so if it's an int it's sixteen gigs
whatever it
the point is that doesn't make sense
ah that's disgusting though so like every time you realize how many like conditionals and stuff are gonna end up in this
well for all of this we basically just seg fault if it's broken so we could just use the C move thing
yeah I guess but still
so we can add a new I R thing that's like if this condition is true seg fault
every time you dereference an array
that's bad
well every other language does it
I suppose
um anyway other optimizations
what other ones are there
um constant propagation
that's part of constant folding
um I dunno my main concern is how we're gonna come up with three to five pages
I know like these are pretty well defined things
I could I'm pretty sure I could go on for like half a page about the munching thing
the if thing was like just obvious
so um
and remember I said about the if thing early on I was like why don't you use this um
the jump less than or equal whatever
yeah I know
you were like nnn
I just forgot how awesome pattern matching was
okay
oh should describe each optimization how you implemented it any heuristics you developed for its application and whether you found it to be effective both on contrived examples and the provided benchmark suite
he didn't provide us a benchmark suite
whatever
seriously
maybe when he releases the tests
also maybe we can just make a thing that's only effective on contrived examples
yeah
Right , so the background for this is that it's for my child psych class
and these are qu- , these are questions that I've written based off the suggestions that um were given for the paper assignment
Um , so for all these questions please keep in mind how you would answer them specifically in terms of your own childhood slash how you were raised or you intend to raise your own children , and how you see children being raised in society as a whole
those a- those are the three things you should keep in mind
but otherwise , it's quite straight-forward
but otherwise it's quite straight forward , exactly ha ha ha
so question one how do you see nature , that is genetic makeup , and nurture , physical and social environment , contributing to a child's developmen
nature and nurture , not nature or nurtur
you can treat is as an and or question if you would like
they're fairly open to interpretation
well , I see both of them making a contribution
and uh , especially the oh the nurture , the environment or lack of it
hh hh hh
children coming from a good home versus a so-called broken home , children with access to good food and good education versus no access
so I think it makes a tremendous difference in how the child turns out
ok , excellent
question two is what do you think influences the development of specific traits such as athletic ability , food preference , choice of friends , and intellectual abilit
oh boy
well , let's see choice of foods and friends is mostly what you grow up with
you eat what your parents eat , or what you're forced to eat
Um , you may be influenced by your friends in the sense of being introduced to junk food , for example
but again , a lot of the primary influence is you either get good or bad eating habits from your immediate home environment
um athletic ability that's a tougher one
Well basically the question is looking for whether or not you think it's something that is inherantly biological or something that you acquire through social interaction or environmental factors
I don't think people are born athletes
Certainly if you decide to become an athlete of a particular kind your genetic makeup will help in a sense you'll have longer legs or good bones or whatever , but if you don't have parents who are willing to encourage the ability or if you don't have access to a running track or a gymnasium or whatever it is the environment counts for a lot
mm
in my own mind , I'm an olympic gold medalist
hh hh hh indeed you are
right , so what child-rearing practices do you view as most and least effective , in terms of discipline , encouragment etc what is the right role for a parent to play in a child's lif
most effective leading by example
least effective coercion by punishment
very concise , wow
°so Dad°
°where'd you go
I should say most effec- or least effective coercion by reward and punishment
ok , I'll add that Um , but in terms of , then discipline what , how do you see discipline working , the
aaah Most effective least effectiv
yea
aah
that looks ridiculous hh hh
the village stocks
I know , right
I mean , you didn't beat the crap out of me when I was little
right , and I never once felt I had to either but why , I mean I can't re
well , I mean cuz we were talking about it in class , like different , different methods of discipline , different methods of enforcing rules in a house and I mean , how-how do you communicate to a child this is how we do things in this house , and if you don't do things this way , this is the consequenc
I mean ok , well it doesn't even have to be specific to me as a kid , like what , how do you see like an ideal scenario like that playing ou
if you , if- if the kid's not allowed to put their feet on the chair , like what , how do you communicate to them they can't do tha
do you like scream at them , do you hit them , do you say I'll give you a candy bar if you don't do that , like
I think , no it's I would say explain the reason for it
I mean , those are all ridiculous extremes , but y'know
and try to get the kid to understand why that that's rule exists I mean , the last thing you want is that's the law because I said so
ok
right ok , so no handing down of ha ha commandments
no , as they say , no appeals to authority
∬he's ironing right now , by the way just for the record , that's why he keeps disappearing he just put away the ironing board and we're at Pap's∬
that's easier said than done , of course
ok , so the next question is do you believe that children learn more from their peers or from older children and adult
oh , I think they learn more from their peers , simply because their peers are the ones they associate with most , and however well- , aah , I mean obviously you learn from your parents
you learn the roles from your parents , you learn the interesting stuff from your peers hh hh and for older children naaah I don't know , I don't think I , uh , it depends on how yeah , I'd say more peers
mkay hoooo , let's see This is the one for you
No , actually that't the next one my bad um , what changes in child-rearing practices have you witnessed across generation
so it was primarily for Pap , that one , but
well , for my- wha
well , for my generation there were certain things that you did that brought out the leather strap
jumping on the bed was one , I can speak to personal experience from there ehm
ooh that was administered by your da
yea , but I think sometimes my mother , but usually my dad
and then of course there was the corporeal punishment in schools with the the cane
and was that at the Christian school , or /
well , they're all Christian in Ireland , so
that's true , k
well there was a oh no nuns , no , teachers this was a- this was at the boys national school so that wan't run by a religious organization
but they would've been brothers handing down the whacking or nuns or just teacher
and what kinda things would you get caned for and like , to what exen
God
Um , not doing your homework , or answering questions incorrectly when you should know them
god
yea when you're supposed to learn something about a subject , and you might get away with one or two wrong answers , but if you're consistantly
and it was a han
yea , six
Si
if it was really bad I don't think I ever got six , but six of the best , it used to be called
god what'd the cane look lik
it looked like a walking stick , but made of really skinny bamboo , so it would go whshew
oh god
would sting when it came down
it was a very skinny walking stick flexible
and why the han
and if it had followed that trajectory we would now have an advanced design carbon fiber model
tscheehehe Shing , shing
oh brother
and why the han
because it was easier than the buttocks hh hh
ok so have you noticed any cultural differences in the ways that children are raise
Mister resident alien
oh , I dunno if it's cultural so much as generational the fact that when I'm in a restaurant and I see the parents , the Yuppie parents smiling indulgently as their little brat almost goes head-first through a display case hh hh
it doesn't have to be I mean just you
hh hh there's where the leather strap might be appropriate hh hh
oh look , little Benjamin is shitting on the floor
hh hh ha
how cute , it's in the form of a heart
oh my god
he's not stealing , he's expressing his desire for more treats
tyha
no , but I mean you say that but you didn't beat the shit out of me when I was little , so
but you weren't a monster for some reason
an I think part of it was , you learned to talk very early on and we could communicate with you I think it's a big difference-we never had the Terrible Twos be-because you could talk well before two , and
that is true , I think I mean it really does play a big role
see , you should've had a nother one , then it would all have been different
it's not that there wer- it's not that there weren't some battles , but it was just , y'know I heard the horror stories from other people because I think they were just trying too hard
they had this idea that
although I mean ther-there're kids who can't actually produce speech themselves , but they-they still undoubtedly understand a lot of what you're saying , so it is possible to reason with them , even if they can't respond to you in words , but I still definitely think it makes it more difficult yeah
alright , nearly there um , have you noticed any sex differences in the way that children are raise
not apart from the the stereotypical stuff , you know the boys play with the tanks and guns and the girls play with the dolls because that's what people will give them
the same thing with dressing them
but in terms of attitudes of parents towards the children discipline-wise , chores , career encouragement , that kind of thing no difference
I can't say I have because I haven't really paid attention to what other people do unless they're blatantly setting the child up to be a psychopath in later life
ok and I mean , if you reflect on your own childhood though , I mean , obviously I know the way that you guys raised me , I wasn't told that I was destined to be a secretary or whatever , but um I mean the way when you were growing up , did you notice differences in the way that boys and girls were raise
um∬I can't say that I did , but they were probably there , I just never if there's anything to it I'm oblivious∬
ok nnnuh , that's fine
alright , and the last one is comparing two like the most prominant theories of this type of child development , there's stage theories and continuous development the-theories
and so stage theories , the kind of dumbed-down explanation is that children go through distinct stages as they mature and they have to be ready to be ready to move out of one stage before they can go on to the next one Piaget
yea
um , and the continuous development is that children gradually learn new things as they mature and kind of master each task as they go , that there's no specific stage
specific stage
and so my last question for you is which one of those theories do you think most accurately represents your views , and why would you say tha
that's funny because well , yea when we we talk , there's a thing included in some topic of computer science called process improvement
it's an essay question
hh hh
and there are process improvement models that have been put out by the guy who died recently , Ross Hunter and there's a stage model that he used
hh , that's funny
and there are computing theories about , you know this company in that stage one , stage two , stage three whereas this one is yea , they're doing a little bit of this , but here they're doing that from a higher level
but in that model they're two things that can co-exis
uum
because , the the the proponents of the two respective theories are like bitter enemies in psychology , and
yea , I think well
they're not in this , yea
yea I mean they , th-the the stage theories came first , so continuous development references stage theories , even though they don't agree with it they're like 'oh , well you see such-and-such a kid is obviously exhibiting elements of this stage but also of this stage' but they don't actually believe in the concept of stages
so , I think it's more two models that
Whereas Piaget in the stage theories idea was really hardcore about like you have to have accomplished all of these developmental milestones within this stage before you can move on
Doesn't correspond to age I-I mean it roughly does , but th-the individual markes are the things that you gave gone through , the things that you have mastered , and until you have done all of them , you are stuck in whatever stage
yea , but not , but not necessarily
ah I mean so it's it's
so which one of those would you go fo
well the problem is , it's never an either-or
well yea , I mean I understand that , but like or d'you have any kind of leavnings or or you just ambivalent about i
I duno , I think practically I would just with continuous , but the uh , I can certainly see how there are some adults that they may be chronologically adults but they're still teenagers
ok so that's the-the stuck in one stage kind of ide
yea
mkay , well unless you have anything that you would like to add , or things that you think I left out or whatever , then that the end of the questions
any other profound words for posterit
hh hh that will be immortalized in this four page fantastic documen
hh hh
shit , you could write a book about any one of those questions
I know , well I mean
I kind of , did more for these questions than was necessary for the assignment because they give you like two example questions in the assignment and they say like talk to your parents and your and your grandparents or whoever in your family about these issues , and make sure to invol-include mention of nature versus nurture and continuous versus discontinuous development in your analysis , they didn't say
try , to get the essence of it , yea , it's
soo , um yea
tsk , right
well this is good , because Mam is not here , and I was hoping I was gonna have an opportunity to do the two of you separately because I figured if I did both of you at the same time you would pollute each other's responses
And then it's I mean it's hard enough to get down one person's responses , if your trying to write two people's different responses at the same time you'd go crazy
ah yea , that's better to have yea
ooh my god
this call is now being recorded
hello
hell
hi mom did it tell you that the call was being recorde
ya what's going o
ok good it's working
I have to do an assignment for Language and Thought where I have to , record a telephone record a conversation and then , transcribe it
so do you have ten minute
I don't have ten minutes right now can I call you bac
a little bit late
ya I have
work in two and a half hours
in how long do you when do you wor
from ten to two
oh ok so can I call you like in a half an hou
ya
ok
bye
bye
Google Voice this call is now being recorded
hello
hi brent
hi mom
how can I help yo
ok so so I have to do this transcription for language and thought
ok
worth ten percent of my grade
alrighty
have a ten minute conversation and then transcribe it
so , what are you doin
I'm sitting here watching the
I was asleep
and now I'm awake
and I'm watching the city council meeting
so what do you have t
come on
ask me the questions
there is no questions we have to have a conversation
oh
for ten minutes
there's no survey or anything
oh ok
well that's easy
yep
how are yo
good
how are your classes goin
good
I have a test a final tomorrow and a paper due on Thursday another paper due on Friday
and then a final on Monday
good for you well you're in college
that's what you're sposta to be doing
I talked to the guy who wrote my recommendation for law school
he said the same thing you did about the personal statement
don't apologiz
ya about my GPA
ya you just say that you enjoyed doing other things
stop apologizing , just say , I had an interesting experience in college
I started a business and a charity
look what I did
isn't this interestin
did you read th
I read your revision
I still thought that you , apologized too much
reall
uh huh
ya your revision needs a revision
is that o
ok
how come you were sleepin
I was on call last night honey
where's Willso
he's right next to me
on the be
on the bed and
he wants special dog jammies for Christmas
oh Willson
so what are we gonna d
if we have
five people but only four
ticket
for the Redskins gam
I dunno
how's the fraternity hous
its good
how's the room-mat
he's good
how's The Dud
he's good
he survive
he's good he was
supposed to live in the desert
they don't always have food
supposed to go through feasts and famine
ya
we had a meeting tonight
for two hours
a fraternity meetin
ya
where do you sit in the meetin
hu
do you sit towards the bac
or towards the fron
in the back
oh gosh
dad's listening to a lot of people , talking , at the city council meeting
a woman in a cowboy hat
abou
I dunno what they're talking about
medical office buildings
I dunno what she has to say
I thought they already made the decision on tha
I dunno
Is it about the parking or somethin
it's about something like
limiting the medical offices in the city
but it was so interesting , that I fell asleep , and then you called
and I'm awake again to listen to it
local politics
it's important
how do you transcribe laughin
do you say hah
I think I'm supposed to leave it out
you still have to send your essay to Willie for him to help you just add his opinion
I don't know how to change it any more to make it less apologizing
well first off , you don't have to say it so much
you're redundant
I'm gonna print the essay and then I'm gonna talk with you about
how I would rather you state things , cuz there was certain things that I could see
that entire sentences should be omitted
reall
yep
o
ok
I'm tired now
I need to go
to bed
ok bye
bye
wh
what was up earlie
just the people that were around us I was like oh my god that douchebag motherfucker
wait , who was i
oh just 'cause like every time jarrett is in the room like just the sound of his voice grates on my nerves
and I'm just like you speak like a tool
and you look like a tool
if it sounds like a tool and looks like a tool
and from what I learned in school about ducks leads me to believe that you are a tool
if it walks like a duck
possibly also a douche
maybe a bitch
you dated him
you know wha
way to throw that back in my face
let's use my track record to indicate that that means nothing
way to throw that back in my face you sick twat
I love you
don't you even
we're done here
we're done
well who have you date
wha
don't even
I mean I'm pretty sure that Jon qualifies as a pretty big tool
I love how she's like who have you date
not going_to lie
yep
I mean you know
that was really bad
you sort_of didn't realize it at the time
this table seems really depressing all of a sudden
I like this table
this table's the best
she has a successful relationship under her belt
you sick bitch
my boyfriend's great
we've been dating for three and a half years
you know wha
we're going to get married
oh that doesn't mean anything trust me
I have a cock you can suck on
oh no we have a great culture of mutual love and respect
it's good stuff
is that code for good sex or just good drug
I'm going to transcribe all of this
it's going to be great
please do
please
oh my God I want this to show up in a paper for MacWhinney
it will
is he seeing this transcriptio
by the same token
I'll keep my comments to a minimum
he'll be in debt until he's like forty five
wha
by the same token he'll be in debt until he's like forty five
life's a tradeoff
you kno
life is a fun time
it's a fun time
I didn't want to come back here so badly
I was just like wrestling with the idea of just not taking my finals like
yeah
I was like , how much would that hurt m
I'd probably get a d in everything but I think I could handle that
I think if I just stopped now I wouldn't fail anything but I would just
oh wait
okay I might get like a c in something
oh no you'd fail this
you'd fail this
this whole project is worth like seventy percent of our grade
oh that is true
that is true
wha
what project is i
for research methods
for research methods in cognitive psych we have to like design a project an experiment do it and then present it and then write a paper on it
the project is legitimately worth like all of our grade
and so far we've just done the project
well all aspects of the project
like the paper itself the presentation
what was your project o
we were looking at the possible existence of internet language as a separate lexicon such that it hinders comprehension when you switch from internet lexicon to standard written English
it's true
basically Facebook makes you dumber
it happens
which I think is our tagline
but we didn't find anything that suggests it happens but basically we're just attributing that to our really really poor protocol
and our really really terrible participants
yeah
some of which were on acid
Kelly was honestly on acid when she did this experiment
I wasn't on acid
you were not but Kelly I'm pretty sure was on acid
yeah

I'm hungry for you
we were having a conversation like at minimal
who were we sitting nea

I'm reading this
I'm reading this
In recent years a new form of written English language has emerged
neo-English i like that
reminds me of neo-Nazi
I don't that's what we want people drawing comparisons between
shh
or The Matrix
let's think The Matrix
and that works 'cause it's technology
specific platforms
let's just turn it change everything from internet lexicon into Keanu Reeves from that point forward entirely
wait I should edit this
yeah go for it
give me the bread
fuck I can't really eat this
you should have seen him
like he was trying to grade a paper and he'd get through a sentence and he's just reach over and like subconsciously grab the bread and he'd be like no I can't eat
no not until after the paper
and then I still didn't finish the paper
'cause y'all bitches have been distracting me
I wuv you
aw
I'm gonna pee on you
Scott's signs of affection
well ya know
I'm just gonna nosh on this
I'm just gonna make a CD called like the sounds of Scott
all I'm saying is is if I die this year you'll have a lot of key choices to paint on the Fence
and you'd better show up
we'll just make you a second Fence
I will watch from below
oh please do
please just make me several Fences that will fit all of my witticisms
they'll have to like extend the Fence like forty feet into like the parking lot of Margaret Morrison
I've already done the math
Scott with an exclamation point fits perfectly
on the posts
Scott
Scott
or Scott with like a cock
Scott
just draw a penis
be like Scott penis
and then it will be like actual size next to it
write that
and then people will think I died and it was tragic because I would have been such like a bounty for the porn industry
it would have been amazing
I can't believe you're not sharing your talent
what is thi
does anyone know what this i
wha
is it a bur
or like a spider bit
it's too small to be a burn
I saw that Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhall movie
mhmm
which on
Love and Other Drugs
how was tha
how was tha
it was good
there was lots of naked
like lots
that's what I heard
it was awesome actually because he has a good ass
I will say this now
his ass
oh my God there's this one scene where just like they just stop having sex and he pulls back on his underwear but like only part way and then he like stands up because she's like okay you can go home now
he's like okay
and then just like underwear half on his ass
shirt like kinda tucked in
and like oh Jake Gyllenhall
you my child
Jake Gyllenhall's awesome
he's awesome in so many ways
although he's not Arabian or like Middle Eastern for that Prince of Persia
or British
that was
anything
Anne Hathaway
he keeps confusing his ethnicity
he thinks he's every ethnicity
well I don't know where the fuck Gyllenhall comes from
but let me tell you Anne Hathaway
sound Irish
she is a sexy bitch
she was naked for like a solid twenty minutes of that movie
at once or like
like you never actually saw her vagina but you almost saw her vagina like so many times
but like you're just like wow Anne Hathaway
you can do this
you can just be naked
good for you
good for you Anne Hathaway
I wish I was one of those people who could just like be naked
well what's it called
I watched I saw Megamind with uh
were they nake
no they weren't but no Noah
I heard that sucked
actually it was good
is that the one with the blue hea
it was funny but it was not nearly as good as any of their other previous stuff
but I just saw it with Noah and the entire time he just screamed heteronormativity the entire movie
he would
I just wanted to punch him in the face after a while
like there was small children all over the place
whatever it's a children's movie
what does that even mea
it's basically like portraying society in a way that like doesn't really allow for homosexuality
like that just implicitly or explicitly suggests that hetero is the only way to go
and he's just been using the word heteronormativity for anything that happens ever for the last like four months
heteronormative
and I'm just tired of it
I mean
like I'm
I'm just like tired of his use of heteronormativity
oh my God
everything is heteronormative
I'm just like yes
I realize that the world is a straight world and that it's sad but you need to stop using that word before I punch you in the face
just pick a new word
there we go
headshot
wha
do we all have kill
that was a great headshot
I had a good one too
yours wasn't a headshot
yes it was
oh was i
yep
mine wasn't
yeah
I got owned
god damnit
I think Teisenbe's hacking
yeah , pretty much
here we go
arr , Headshot
headshot
there we go
that was a headshot but I was spraying so it was luck
I was using the burst fire Clarion headshot
I got three kills that round , Nice
hacking , Teisenbe's hacking
yeah , I got a completely long range kill
thats called being lucky
no its called
no like , I was shooting for awhile
and its called knowing
called luck
its called luck
you're applying the law of large numbers
no no , like
its not luck if you like
its luck if you flip a coin , and get heads
that is how this game works
none of the guns are accurate enough after the first shot to not be luck
yeah
the AK is pretty accurate
the first shot's accurate
the next one's aren't
goddamnit Teisenbe
goddamnit , Teisenbe
goddamnit Teisenbe
what are you doin
he's hacking
somebody spec Teisenbe , I don't trust him
what Teisenb
spec him
oh well he , he's got the bullet hose
what , he's gonna get a kill from across the map with the bullet hos
I have done it before
I have gotten two headshots , from across the map , same round , with the bullet hose
yep , thats called luck
I've also done it with the Ingram
that is called luck
ah , got one
oh goddamnit Teisenbe , get out of my way
teisenbe is the only one left
he just got killed though
ah , which one's tha
I don't even know
the one after the P_nine_O
oh , that one
and I'm on the one after that
we all went
absolutely nothing , Like we all just died
we all went the same way , and we all got
no I went a route
you just got owned
I died
well , three of us got owned
did anyone get a kil
I don't think so
nope
no
terrorists are all
well no , thats cause we keep killing ourselves
yeah
they don't get credit for us killing ourselves
hu
they do not get credit for us killing ourselves
no , but we lose a point
oh we do , thats right
we all have shitty guns now
the Five_M_Gs aren't that shitty
the P_nine_Os not that bad , but the map
yeah this isn't a great map for it
the P_nine_O is
you , you , you don't need to get lucky at really long range
what are you doin
keep at a distance , Keep the bots , like completely you can aim by click , click
keeping distance is not a good idea cause the bots have rifles
yeah but like if their , if their back
yeah , see that doesn't work
yeah it does
wow
the hell man
m
yeah
I uh ambushed a bunch of them
goddamnit Teisenbe
thats what I tried to do last round and it didn't work
rashar
I know
yeah , kill yourself
no jump off , goddamnit
got stuck on the ladder
how did you get stuck on the
I don't know
you're not a bot
no , Shut the
still have shotguns
forgot that
wait did you get a kill with the Mac_Te
yeah
what're you doin
goddamnit they rushed yo
don't rush me
anyone get a kill that roun
wait , I'm still alive
not for long
I died , but
like I told you , not for long
I got
ironically on this map pistols are actually easier cause pistols have better range
yeah
than shotgun
and the S_M_Gs
uhh
yeah they do
some
that was a pretty good round
yes
damnit
uhh , is everyone else dea
stole my kill is alive
thats me
I know
still on the second SMG
now I'm on the
I'm counting , opposite direction
I'm on the fourth
oh shit
the one time they rush me I don't have it out
there we go
goddamnit
that was like , the perfect situation to get a kill with that gun though
the bullet hos
yeah , It was
they haven't been rushing much
we have
teisenbe you're the only one
goddamnit
it Teisenbe
he has sound though
yeah that is kind of OP
it helps him find them
I don't think that
I am currently taking footsteps off
footsteps is off
ok
like , it
its by no means the only thing but it does
what the fuck
yeah , you're using
come on we got , the guy's damage to me
I had to turn around shotgun
I got him to twenty five health at long range with the bullet hose
they're ignoring you then
I
that means they're ignoring you
no he was shooting at me , And he was missing
which one is the bullet hos
its the cheaper one
its the cheapest
teisenbe got a pistol kill
uh , well , its not that hard
he got it
there we go
how you do it
goddamnit , Stop stealing my kills
they're all in here
yeah , I knew that would
yeah
both camping
everyone , yeah
in the air
yeah , I saw that
ok now we're all
except Teisenbe
you're hacking
I'm , I'm on the previous one
the round starts once I
yeah , that happens
goddamnit
I shoudl have had a kill that round
they're using S_M_Gs
teisenbe got another one
teisenbe kill yourself
its not surprising that Teisenbe got a deagle kill
I know but I wish he'd stop getting kills
no no , No
I was gonna do that but
only one left
you didn't even , wait
no , wrong guy
well , I need a different
ok he just
ok now I'm now I'm on the
goddamnit
I gave you that kill
I was above , too
no I like , shot him up a bunch , and then you killed him
oh well , I'm on the auto shotgun now
auto shotguns not too bad on this
we should go a two v two only bullet hose
yeah I know
I'm pretty sure
maybe two v two pistols only
no , two v two bullet hose only
because , then it would be
we did that yesterday , and like
bullet hose onl
knives only
like , thats why I don't do that
reall
least I don't gotta
at least we don't have to keep restarting

Yah Yeah and we were and we thought the movie was in three-D so she was like what's three-
And i explained it to her and she was like what's two-
and i was like woah
If i were five i would not be able to make the connection between two-d and three-d
Yeah sooooooo what's a three-d movi
She doesn't like
remember I told you you put glasses o
And then what happens when you wear the glasse
It pops out at yo
and then then what's what's two-d
it's a regular movie
Cause like what's ahhh a tv screen is flat , righ
so nothing can like pop out
I was so shocked , but um did you like the movie yesterda
ya
what was your favorite par
I didn't see it i wish i'd gone
Tell joseph what happens
well um one thing happened was her hair um rapunzel's hair was magic
magi
and then fling cut it off
fling , is that the princ
His name is Flin
Tell the story of rapunzel
Rapunzel um the queen was sick and she was about to have a baby
yeah
and then there was what what made her feel bette
A flower drink
yep , shampo
and then um
she felt better , righ
yeah , and then an old lady came and disguised as a mommy
what'd she do to rapunze
take her
took
and then , so she grew up , and every day on every year on her birthday she looked out the window and what did she s
lanterns
say wha
lanterns , and her parents were like the prince the king and the queen and since they didn't know where their daughter was they like lit lanterns in the sky
And how old was she when she asked her mom to leav
eightteen
and what'd she d
go out
went out
she did a lot of things remembe
paint
she painted
what else
and there was a guy named pascal and like he was a little baby guy
yeah what did he d
and she played hide and seek
and that got her to it changes colors
that's not a gecko it's a chameleon
chameleon , um so so what happened when she asked her mom what did her mom say when she asked to leav
no
was she really mad or was she kind of ok with it
she was mad
yeah , and here's a tough one
do you , why did the mom the evil witch lady keep rapunzel in the towe
because she didn't want her to leave
yeah she did'nt get it
it's cause her hair had magic powers , and when rapunzel sang to her mom she brushed her hair and her hair made her stay young because she actually was an old witch but she wanted to stay young and look young forever
she didn't get that
that's ok
um yeah , um so how did she leave the towe
you already knew that part though
the the saying rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair
Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your gold hair
is there more than tha
i forget
I think that's it
So what kind so was the movie like animate
or real people or was it computerize
like computer animated
you know what i mea
I don't even know
you don't know
thtat's ok
tell me the rest
no you already saw the movie
there's , do you remember what the horses name wa
there's a horsie
maximus
Maximus , that's a good name
When you read stories in school do you do you have a good memory you can always remember the names of the character
yeah but i forgot
hh face smack
hh face palm
eoughhhhh
ahhhh eoughlaaaaa
you do peter eyes you roll your eyes up like that peter doesn't even do that
pick any job for just one month , what job would you hav
what job would you like to hav
assume that you would have the skills and knowledge to perform adequately
Well , clearly
it'd be a pretty terrible job if you couldn't perform it well
yea , if you could do anything good for a month and afterwards you aren't very good at it anymore so they have to fire you
my gut reaction is , like , astronaut
but I don't think that'd be that exciting of a job unless it's , the one month , that you're out in space
yea , well , let's assume that you're out in space
I think , that might be cool , but astronauts do a lot of work
it'd be cool for , a day , or maybe two , but for a month , they do a whole lot of work , and experiments , and have to be super disciplined
yea
maybe I would want to be a poker star
that would be a sweet job
because then you make a ton of money , and it's exciting
and
you get kind of famous
yea , you get kind of famous , some people know who you are get to hang out with , other cool people and talk strategy
pretty good job
yea
I don't think well maybe being a sports player
but that's
yea , again , but I mean , you can get most of the thrill of that by playing sports
yea
I mean , playing them on a professional is cool and all , but not really that much more exciting I don't think
no
other than the , you know , fame and forturne that goes along with it
yea
you could be like the head of a state for a month
I would not want to be that
that'd be hard
it'd be incredibly hard and stressful
yea maybe that's not a good one
could be in charge of somethin
what's just a cool jo
um
I mean we skiped rock star
oh yea rockstar would be nice
that's a cool job you get to music all day , meet a lot of sweet people , everybody likes you
everybody that you meet likes you
baisically
that would be pretty cool
doesn't seem nearly as stressful as most of the other like fame jobs
yea could be a spy
wouldn't want to be a spy
I dont know , if you're good at it you might like it
that's true
assuming that you can get dropped at the middle of a spy mission and already be you know , knee deep so it's not like you're just starting or something
fair enough
yea
um
let's try a new Chat Starter
okay
uh , if you were required to wear a hat at all times , what sort of hat would you wea
So who's is thi
Yours
Yay

If you just need email you can always start with just a live eh a hotmail account
Hotmail or gmail
Hotmail hotmail
What is hotmai
Microsoft

It will come with a uh skydrive and you can sync to your computer and do a whole bunch of things
Ok if you want the whole website and corporate then you want a more eh as long as it's just two of you just go with hotmail
Hotmail dot co
Yea I thought it was about the new business
I am not opening a company yet
When it's uh whe whe that's why I was saying it when it will be about the business
Ok hotmail
For this five minutes I'll set you up an email account
Ok
Three minutes if you want
Check if there is Gadi Dvir
Is someone timing m
Yes I am timing you
Look I'll show you dad
I I use this to sync my school folder between all of my computers
It's good righ
Whenever I change a file on one computer it changes uh all the others
So you keep it in eh on the different computers or you keep it in the eh car
I keep it both on each computer and in the card
And in the card
Wow
Ok I'll sign into mine first just to show you
I actually have a bunch of them as you can see
This is the one I use
So you can see right now the folder where I
Where which one this is this i
This is this is hotmail
This is the free one
Here it's just uploading

You'll be really surprised with what you can do
So Naiana there is two kinds of chatzilim

Yea so all of the works
That one is quite hot
Very hot , It's hotter than what I'm used to
So why don't you eat your pomelas , if I may as
W we shared this one
They like better the red uh aniva
We shared we shared this one , but to be fare we ate dinner really late
We were really hungry
You spent so much time on the road
You guys you get tired
Of course you get tired
It was so frustrating
It's tough , No wonder
It was fine
I cried , I laughed , I sang a little
That's when the traffic stopped
When you san
Wonder if there's a connection
So we started talking about uh that we started talking about the fact that we're really enjoying operations and supply chain management
What do you mea
The class
Like the course
Oh the class ok
I started thinking maybe to do a phd in it and she asked me why
I said because then we could retire and open a consultant service and then we talked
That's pretty close to what you're planning to do with the uh guy from MIT
Correct
It's not eh I don't know how it will work and whether something will come out of it
I understand
That's ok
He's not gonna do it for the money he's going to do it uhhh
So it means you like basically industrial engineering
That's the bottom line
He's so good at it
The professor says ok anybody here wants to answer apart from Eran
Eran already knows it
He actually said in the second lecture you can you can't answer any more you can teach the class
On what operation managemen
Supply chain management , yea but uh
Lior is majoring in industrial engineering
Lior Koren
Lior Koren
Yes I know
In which school now Orego
Georgia Tech
In in Georgia Tech
You consider that majo
No one of our family friend's daughter's
That's a that's a mighty good major at a mighty good school
What is he wait what is he doing her
She no Koren Lior Koren
Got it , I'm confused
From Massachusetts , remember Pini and Einat Kore
Oh she got into Georgia Tech , that gir
She also got into Carnegie Mellon , but not the engineering school
She's not doing very well
Reall
Yea that's what Einat said
I'm surprised
She went Greek
She went Greek too
She went wha
Greek , She joined a sorority
You want that phone instea
No , I was wondering if you could see anything with the sticker
Why did you put the stickers ther
I don't know
We were bored one day
There were stickers
It doesn't take much
To entertain the cre
Look how nice my wallpaper is
Nice
Wanna see min
Sure
Did you see my new wallpape
Oh , crap
Oh nice
I know these people
Did you see min
No
Oh nice
I know these people too
Are they the same peopl
It's the same people
Shocking
It's a different photo though
Yeah
One is from Cannon Beach
The other one is from I don't know where
South of Yellowstone
Yeah
The southern edge of Yellowstone
Right before you out of Yellowstone into
Tita
Oooh pretty
Great Titán
That's a good picture
By the way we stayed at the the the the hotel in the Great Titán
And we we stayed in a cabin
That's what we did back then
It's a beautiful view
We stayed in a cabin
That's where we stayed
I don't remember
I believe you , but I don't remember
I remember the cabin from the Great Canyon from the north rim
I don't remember that
I just remember , we just remember going down
I remember going down , going down a third of the way
I mean we , we got up in the morning
A lot of stupid people
The kids no , the adults
And then somebody said let's go down
Somebody said
Who di
Danny
Danny
Who els
Let's be honest
So we said Ok , let's go down
That's from the north rim
That's higher than the south rim
So we're going and going and going no water , just really not ready , with a bunch of little kids
We're going
We're going down into the Grand Canyon
We're just walking down
Got up in the morning , we're walking down
No food , no wate
No , Really
Are you seriou
Yea
It's ok , it's ok , we never made it down
About a third of the way third of the way we got tired
We realized
No no no come on
Got tired going down and we realized that we still had to go everything we went down back up
A third of the way we realized that we were going down into the Grand fucking Canyon and there is a reason they put a grand before the name
It was amusing
Oh come on
It was better than the Vadi Kelt expedition
Yea but then we were ready
To what swim down the ehhhh river the river the stream
Yea with the camera camera got wet there
We were wading to a track down the eh the eh stream bed
Yea we go the camera got wet
Whose idea was that
It was Aryeh's camera anddd
Whose idea was eh to walk down not on the trail on the bed
I don't know not mine
Totally mine
Oh wait
No you weren't even there
You weren't even a concept yet
But it was very unpleasant
Supposedly I was a concept from day one
It was very very unpleasant to tell Aryeh that his camera his beloved camera got wet was traumatic
yes so obviously the big thing to talk about is
release
release
because apparently no one knows what we're doing
I mean we do but no one else does
so
so we're recording them using your iPad and then making transcripts
no I might bring an interface and an actual microphone probably
I wasn't sure if we were gong for like the subtle like people aren't aware that they're being recorded
the idea is that they should know but we shouldn't make it blatantly obvious
we should know but we shouldn't like put a cam
we shouldn't like stand in front of them like shoving a mic in their face and be like
that would just make them nervous
exactly , that's
that'a what we wanted to avoid
a big giant microphone is staring at them
well usually in Japanese class they record all of the presentations and stuff
what they do is just take a regular old tape recorder and put it on the table
okay
I'm just not sure if
I feel like I can type fast enough
You're sayig that it's not necessar
I mean we're bound to miss something
okay I mean as long as
as long as we are fine with taking the time afterwards to go through all of them and that we know that we can tell people that in a way that
because the whole point is that we just need to make sure that people actually talk about something and then we can get a written version of it
yes
part of the thing is that nobody ever took notes before and didn't even try
I think as long as they're okay with being recorded I think that's the better solution because it's more thorough and that's more correct
if you think taking notes is a viable alternative
it could also be very distracting
someone's like typing away and it's like
and like and at thi at this hour they said something so insightful and now they've said something really dumb
don't put that on the record
whipe that from the record
um
but yes um food
are we going to have food for releas
I think I think before we talk about food we should talk about how we want to
yes this is true
so we've got uh how many groups do we have twelve , thirtee
thirteen
thirteen
um
well okay Space Game was the fourteenth one
no , the fourteenth one was Not Asteroids
oh right that was the one that died
yeah
uh Space Game I think should still present
they went long enough that they
yeah
I think I I think their postmortem could actually be useful
if he sticks at all to the postmortem thing it will be useful and if he completely doesn't do anything relevant to what a postmortem is
then
it's not a very good postmortem
well if he uses this to start another politics debate
maybe have him do some
right
cause you can say what about GCS's policies didn't allow the project to do whatever but
well if it gets
instead of starting like a flame war
yeah if it gets into an off topic flame war
was he saying that befor
yeah
last meeting
not not last meeting
it was the last meeting of Space Game where he said he was cancelling the project and we asked him what the problem was and he basically went on this flame war rant about why GCS sucks
yeah that was fun um
but if it gets to that we'll just tell him to stop and move on
I think we're gonna have to time limit them anyway
yeah , we're definitely gonna have to time limit them
we're gonna have to cut it off at five minute
we we wanna have room for Q and A
that's cause that's what happened the last Spring was a bunch of people left as soon as they could
but a lot of peole stayed
but not nearly as many people as you would who were there
so do you wanna try four minutes and just no Q and
I would just say keep it at five minute cause some groups might have less to say and we might have more time for questions
well we could mention that you should try to be concise and not take up time if you don't need to in the email
yeah but also like when we play the games a lot of the times it's the creator that's standing right next to the game and that's another time you can ask questions
that's true and then and then they don't feel like they're being grilled by the whole club if they're the one up there whereas like you can like as an alternative we can go up to Chris afterwards and then say all right why don't you think like the club is condu conducive to your games
well but the real reason we like Q and A during postmortems is because there are interesting questions that can benefit the rest of the club
yes
yeah
and they would also be good to have on record
would an hour and a half be too long to do all of the
I don't think so
okay cause if we gave everybody seven minutes and said
just like five minutes for
well well we could say five minute cutoff for speaking , two minute cutoff for Q and A
an hour would be fine which is about five minutes
well how about four minutes for speaking and a minut for Q and
well I don't wanna like restrict anybody to anything but I would just cut it off , see how it goes and cut it off
I don't think that everyone will be seven minutes
um
you'd be surprised
five minutes and then at the end of five minutes whatever just cut them off , have the next person go and that should be a little over an hour
yeah
okay
and then we can have food and games
I still think five minutes is , I dunno , i it's a problem because we have so many groups and
but it's , but that's still only , that's like an hour and ten minutes cause if you , if you give every group like thirty seconds between
we could try to do food during the Q and A so people would
I'm not sure if that would be distracting and that if that would also like encourage people to stay by saying that there's pizza
all right , I have an idea why don't we try something differen
why don't have them speak with a five minute cutoff and then have all of them stand in front as as a panel and then have people ask whoever they want questions or just the
there's thirteen groups , people will forget what the people at the very beginning said
cause it's like what happened at Pitch Fair when everybody did their thing and at the end nobody could remember
who said what
yeah
yeah
that was actually the biggest problem with Pitch Fair
it's a little bit different but I feel like it's easier to ask questions like right when everybody's thinking about whatever you're asking about
I I think that's the case
I guess it depends on what kind of questions we want them to ask
if they're questions specifically about the things that were just said then sure , but if they're more general things like
I remember asking Chris like really general general questions last time just cause I knew that he'd have interesting things to say , um , and that would be the kind of thing for like a panel but my , the problem is that it's a lot of people and I think that would work better for like five people or something , but for thirteen I think that's probably too many
cause when you add with Lisa and Sanchez and , and uh Paul and Audra
this is why we seriously need to start limiting the number of projects that get made
well
ho
that's , I mean the whole
we'll discuss that later
the whole point of the , having smaller projects is that there are going to be significantly more of them
yeah , there would actually be more projects if we had shorter projects
there wouldn't necessarily be more semester projects , there would just be more projects
we probably handle those a bit differently
there'd be less at a given time
right , if we had smaller projects , you wouldn't have one day when there are like seventy-x that you'd need to present
so yeah , the food
um , are we gonna have food during the , uh , you know , during the postmortems or afte
wait , what did we do last
well , last Spring , it showed up when we were sitting there and it was just sitting there
yeah , yeah , and it was really awkward cause everyone kept looking at the pizza
so why don't we let people ea
yeah
we could just order it so it comes an hour into the meeting
see I could , the only problem that I have is that when you server greesy pizza while people are playing games
the thing is though , it's fine as long as there are napkins
yeah
I think eating pizza while the postmortems are going on is kind of distracting and rude because people would be constantly getting up and getting pizza and not really paying attention , and it's the most important part , I dunno
if it's the most important part , why are we compressing it so much for the other thin
because playing the games and talking to people individually is also really important and it's kind of , we can't have everyone play their game while giving a postmortem but if nobody gets a chance to play everyone else's game because everyone's a lazy-ass and doesn't give their builds , I think they're both just as important
right
I'd say we don't wanna sacrifice one for the other because they are equally important
postmortems are a thing that happens only once a semester , but those games will be played again when they're more polished in the future
yeah
for example the arcade , uh , late night , there would be plenty of chances
and Release in the Spring
to be actually getting to get
it is in the Spring , but
seeing your hard work from this semester pay off in the form of someone playing and enjoying your game , I think is a big part of feeling like you're done , like that the semester is actually over
why don't we do the game-playing thing first , and then postmortems , out of curiosit
because people would leave , well that was , I thought , the initial problem
yeah , I think postmortems are a tougher sell to keep an audience than games
like let's play games , and then everybody gets really into it and they're like , guys stop having fun , let's talk about this
there's really no easy solution
well , no , if you want the pizza to come an hour in , I can do that too
what do you guys thin
it's fine
I think that would be good
having , having postmortems then pizza come right as they're ending
well , it is gonna take time for everybody to set their laptops up , then get the games ready to play anyway , so we might as well be able to eat
and I'm thinking the pizza could bribe them into staying
well that's , yeah that's when we're eating
like , they'd have the pizza to look forward to after the postmortems are done
I'm trying to imagine what an exodus would look like if we said like all right , we're gonna stop playing games now , and then , you know , postmortems , and everybody sit down in a chair
everybody but the project leaders would leave
I'm trying to , yeah
I don't think it would be that bad
well okay , two thirds of everybody but the project leaders would leave
assuming they came in the first place
let's see what else is there
is there anything els
um , we need to send out an email , we should do that as soon as possible , like today
about Releas
about , about just telling , telling project leaders , well about Release to the whole club , but also to the project leaders specifically
I can do that today
we also , um , need to ask for builds of the games from last semester's right now only Moonwalk is up , cause I put it up there , um
can somebody who has the list of the projects from the last , this semester and last semester , I guess , send that to me so I can check off what I have and
bother peopl
okay
I mean I was going to , at the end of this semester , just bug everyone
okay , then you can do that too
make sure when you ask them about builds , you ask them about like the people who were on their team and , and uh , like a description or something like that too
right
what do we do about the people who graduate
oh
like Sarah
well , I was on that project
that was fun
I think I can find a way to contact Sarah in any case
yeah , we don't have much of an alumni program
well we have more , uh yeah , you're right
they can stay on the mailing list , they just need to either change their email themselves or ask us to change it for them
but I have all the project members for Panda Cook and that was , that would be easy enough to write a description for it so just a build for that
all right , so anything else in regards to postmortem
right basically , brief summary
um , we're limiting postmortems to high , hard cap of uh , five minutes for each postmortem , cause uh if it they drag on too long , everyone will leave before they can play the games
um
and we're gonna be recording them , and then transcribe them later
so what should we talk about no
I mean that was
and then , and then after postmortems , we play games
yes
how much food do you think we should ge
uh , I usually go by uh , dollar amount , so between like one twenty and one fifty , however much pizza I can get for that much money is usually
that's cool
I think that should cover it
I'm not sure how many people are gonna show up
so I think by comparison , I think the last , uh the last two Collab Sessions were like seventy dollars
yeah , they should be about equal
so yes , we've got the uh , then we've got , also got Paolo's event , do we want to talk about that briefl
let's talk about that
okay , so Paolo has an event on the eleventh , which is essencially , um , it's it's essencially like GCS arcade where it would be we all show our games at , to the public
what date is this agai
you said the sevent
the eleventh
oh , got it
it's a Saturay , isn't i
yeah , so did he , did he change the time so that it's not at the same time as BV
I don't think so
okay
it's at , it's at the same time as the invite-only BVW , it's not the same time as the first show , which is open to the public
so it's the VIP show
yeah
um
but it's the VIP show , and it's cooler
yeah , and you have to be invited
which we were , but I don't think we need , apparently we need paper invitations , and there's no way they're gonna print out paper invitations for the entire club
he , he said like in the email he could possibly be , possibly like print out actual invitations for us , but yeah , it's , it was mainly like an
just that the VIP's later so they have more time to practice their acting cause it's like , there's also a performance aspect , so it's the same thing
yeah
okay
yeah , if people aren't as cool or , yeah so it doesn't overlap with the public one , so it would be okay
when is the public on
one , I think
oh , so it's the same day
one until I , I think the next one is at like five or seven or later in the evening
cause , the problem is if they're right one after the other , we'd need time to s , get out of there and set up
yeah
the thing for Paolo
or we could always leave early
wha , what kind of set-up would we have to d
I'm not sure
we're probably just gonna have to plug in our laptops because
how big is the space gonna b
we assumed Paolo is doing most of the set-up since it's his event
yeah , we were told that he has like tables and power cords for us
so it sounds like that
how many tables does he wan
wha
oh so basically we still don't know what's going on
well we know it's at
the how , what space is it in , and how many people is he expecting , like is he , does h
how many games does he want from u
oh , a lot of project people
as many people who can do it , in essencially
people won't be here because it's just like , Saturday of finals week
okay
thank_you ladies for doing my experiment
what's gonna happen now is my experiment is how people make concept maps as they are learning things
and so the name of the game is Mao
and Mao is a game where you learn the rules by playing it in a trial and error sort of way
usually the game is played with a full deck
and there are a_lot more rules
I gave you a paired down version so we could go for a paired down version so we could go for the same rules and not have much variability
the rules were
partners in crime is when two of the same card are put down
that's
continuity is when a card increment of values is put down like a four and a five or a six and a seven
law of fours , you say "/
law of fours
and it then gives the person whose turn it is after you four cards
law of fives is
actually wait
can I hear what you think law of fives is
you have_to put down another card after you put down the five
and what do you think law of fives is
what did you think
the same thing
mkay yes ‡ law of fives is where you put down the five you have_to put down another card after it
Firstname can I hear what you thought have a nice day was
so sometimes when they said "/
to the best of your ability
put down the sevens
you would say
have a nice day
and so I started doing that too
but I didn't really know if that was correct
and I have literally no idea when else I should do it
okay ‡ and what do you think have a nice day is
whenever you put down a seven you say "/
have a nice day
and if the person before you put down a seven , you say "/
thank_you very much
yes
so ‡ seven is like seven days in a week
so to have a nice day
and then if you receive a seven , like if it's your turn , you say "/
thank_you very much
what did you think crazy eights was , Firstname
I thought it was reverse the way we go
but now I think it's like just the person before you goes
and then it goes back to where you were
and what did you think it was , Firstname
I thought it was always reversed in order
it's you skip the next person
oh
so ‡ in the game with like five or six you'd see that because only one person was skipped
because there's
yeah ‡ it was confusing when it was only three
only a game of three
yeah ‡ so the order was never reversed
okay
what did you think bowling was
Firstname
when the two cards
so ‡ there's the card that's already there
and if the card you're putting down makes those two cards add up to ten you call spire
yeah mkay
so that's the game
what rule did you get really fast , Firstname
what was the first rule you got
continuity
and why do you think that was
because that's pretty similar to games like Egyptian_Rat_Screw
where you like try and like match cards that are like in a row
like one in numerical value
and what rule was the hardest for you to get
have a nice day
and why do you think that was
because it seemed completely arbitrary
it wasn't tied to any pattern that I could see in the cards
okay
because I just think I wasn't looking at like singular card values
I was looking for patterns
okay
and what was the easiest rule for you to get
I_guess either continuity or partners in crime
and why would you say so for you
because the names made sense
okay ‡ and what was the hardest
because like they defined it
spare because you introduced it in the last game
mkay
and why do you think /
again because I introduced in the last game you didn't have time to learn it
yeah
okay ‡ what did you /
why do you think law of fives was like kind_of hard to get „ Firstname
because you had_to be watching
like I don't know
hm
I don't know
I_guess with that rule you just had to pay a_lot more attention
about the other rules
and why was the law of fives hard for you
I kept forgetting you need to also put down a card
so I understood that it was similar to law of fours
but it was like I'd forget to put down a card
okay
so yeah ‡ thank_you so much for doing this for me
/
can we play again
no
okay
so ‡ like I said we'll be playing a card game
after each move just write a quick justification of why you made that move
I won't be able to give you any instructions
we're not doing this for gesture or anything
so don't be worried about that
we're not really doing it for speech either
so just feel free to speak
as you're playing a card please write like call out the card that you're laying down
that'd be helpful to me
because I can't see the video of them
mkay
so ‡ let's begin
don't pick them up until I say
alright
okay
so ‡ this is a card game called Mao
before you pick up your cards there are rules
and the rules are are partners in crime , continuity , law of fours , law of fives , have a nice day , and crazy eight
mkay
pick up your cards
we'll start with me and go clockwise
and begin
continuity
seven of diamonds
failure to say have a nice day
failure to say continuity
and then remember just to write down why you put that down
if it's just a guess , just put guess until you can formulate something
law of fours
failure to say thank_you very much
okay ‡ so the last recording was interrupted
we haven't moved forward on the game
I just laid down a four and called law of fours and partners in crime
the rules again just to refresh are partners in crime , continuity , law of fours , law of fives , have a nice day and crazy eights
these are yours
alright
can we /
ugh we can't ask for rules „ okay
law of fours
failure to say partners in crime
remember to write down your justification
okay
okay ‡ keep going
law of fours
law of fours , thank_you very much , have a nice day , partners in crime
unnecessary saying have a nice day
unnecessary saying thank_you very much
continuity
three of hearts
I'm sorry I haven't been calling out
okay
continuity two of hearts
law of fives five of clubs
unnecessary speaking and failure to play another card
what
but failure to play another card
continuity
continuity , seven of spades
failure to say have a nice day
what is this
partners in crime
failure to say have a nice day
failure to say thank_you very much
thank_you very much
what
have a nice day
did you write down
have a nice day , seven diamonds
failure to say thank_you very much
once again , if you could write down the justification
law of continuity
thank_you very much
you don't have_to say "/
law of
okay
partners in crime
this is so stressful
continuity
failure to place another card
I don't understand this game at all
failure to place another card
so when you're done describe done
oh ‡ okay
continuity
failure to say law of fours
this is so frustrating
my turn
law of fours , thank_you very much
unnecessary speaking
failure to say partners in crime
I think the only rule I understand is continuity
continuity
so scared
partners in crime
partners in crime
crazy eights
okay
partners in crime
not your turn
failure to go
continuity
failure to say have a nice day
shit
thank_you very much
the name of the game is Mao
so ‡ that's the end of the first game
if you could put your cards down
actually let's talk about it for a second
so ‡ what rules did you understand
continuity , partners in crime
law of fours
law of fours and law of fives „ I think
mkay
crazy eights I think also reversed our order
yeah
so yeah so it /
that took not as long as I thought
so what we're gonna do
okay
so ‡ we're starting game two
if you wanna like label the first one as game one
and then separate it somehow
and go to game two
you don't have_to say what card you're placing
just kind_of as Firstname's doing is a good one just to write down like the card
okay
yeah ‡ either way's fine
the card's not that important
it's just kind_of how we're dealing with the rules
okay
once again the name of the game is Mao
the rules are law of fours , law of fives , continuity , partners in crime , have a nice day , and crazy eights
we'll start with Firstname and go counterclockwise
continuity
or please write down
partners in crime
okay
partners in crime
is that clover spades
that's spades
spades
crazy eights
wait
I need to finish writing down my reason
have a nice day , continuity
thank_you very /
not your turn
ah
failure to go
so now it's my turn
okay
continuity
have a nice day
failure to say thank_you very much
not your turn
damn_it this is
is it my turn now
what did you say when you put that down
the six
yeah
nothing
not your turn
continuity
thank_you very much
unnecessary speaking
failure to place another card
law of fours
hm failure to say continuity
continuity
crazy eights
you don't have_to play another card
okay
law of fours
continuity /
not your turn
damnit
continuity
partners in crime
continuity
failure to say card
and failure to say law of fours
oh
and once again just keep writing as you
crazy eights
so ‡ Firstname just called crazy eights
continuity have a nice day
thank_you very much , partners in crime
failure to say have a nice day
what
thank_you very much , continuity
did you say have a nice day
I said "/
okay
thank_you very much
continuity
failure to place another card
continuity
for my turn I drew
I just don't know if you missed it
you can do that
I don't have anything
oh
partners in crime
and also because if I played , I'd end the game
and I want to keep it going
that's why I drew
once again , if you could write down
crazy eights
so ‡ Firstname called crazy eights
continuity
unnecessary placing of an extra card
failure to say have a nice day
if you could write down
wait what did she say when she put that down
Firstname , what did you say
I said "/
continuity
and then I put down another card
but it wasn't necessary
okay okay okay
okay ‡ partners in crime , have a nice day , and the name of the game is Mao
failure to say thank_you very much
fuck
damnit
you're close
continuity , crazy eights
not your turn
law of fives
thank_you very much
failure to place another card
remember to write down
I don't understand
this is so stressful
okay
partners in crime , law of fives , law of fours
the name of the game is Mao
failure to say continuity
no
but at_least you're almost winning
I suck at this game
continuity
continuity , law of fours , the name of the game is Mao
damnit
oh ‡ let's see
okay /
oh ‡ shit
I think I figured out most of the rules
mkay
I just keep forgetting about things
okay ‡ so if you could just respond when I say a rule
tell me definitely , I have an idea , or not at all
mkay
okay
law of fours
I have an idea
definitely
law of fives
I have an idea
definitely
have a nice day
not at all
definitely
crazy eights
definitely
definitely
continuity
definitely
definitely
partners in crime
definitely
I have an idea
that was everything „ right
okay ‡ law of fours is a maybe for me
have a nice day
that's
mhm
that's when //
probably shouldn't say
hmhm
okay so ‡ now
so ‡ this is the third game
and we're all //
oh ‡ I'm not
but the two participants are going to speak out loud justification as_well_as write it down
actually instead of writing it down
but if you could write down the cards you put down if that makes sense
but I don't have_to write the reason anymore
hmhm because we're just stating it out loud
mkay
and then we're gonna play this game until we all think we're pretty okay with some of the rules
all of them don't have_to be definitely
but this is just kind_of to get us on the same plane
mkay
once again the name of the game is Mao
I'm calling the rules
law of fours , law of fives , have a nice day , crazy eights , partners in crime , continuity and a final rule bowling
you added a rule
fuck
we'll start with Firstname and go clockwise
partners in crime
and why
because every time someone has called partners in crime it's because they're like two of the same value card
crazy eights
and why
because when you put down an eight it's like a wild card that changes the rotation of play
and then because it's a diamond card I assume I need to put down another card on top of it
unnecessary playing of another card
okay
that's totally not true
okay ‡
law of five
because it's kind_of like a wild card
but like it doesn't matter what was below it
and that means I have_to put down another card
so I'll put down crazy eights
because it doesn't matter what's beneath it
and that changes the direction
okay ‡ I'll start talking
spare
one , two
what's the
because I think they make a spare
okay ‡ continuity
not your turn
o^kay
partners in crime
because
because a two was put down
continuity
because a three is higher than a two by one
oh ‡ I haven't been
I haven't been writing down what
oh ‡ that's okay
don't worry
okay
continuity
because a two is one less than a three
continuity because a three is one more than a two
and the name of the game is Mao
and why did you say that
because whenever you're done you say that
mkay ‡ I'm gonna give you more cards just so we can keep playing
okay
but I win
yes
yes
okay so ‡ it's my turn „ right
I put down a four , continuity
because it's one more than three
okay
and law of fours also applies
because
because it's a four
then you get four cards
because I said law of fours correctly
otherwise I would get four cards
because I would fail
okay ‡ continuity
and because it's a five
partners in crime
spare
and because it's a five continuity
I'm putting down a seven and calling continuity
because it's one more than six
and have a nice day because it's a seven
oh
I can't play anything
I mean I'll put down a three
I don't think I can play the
that's just all that I have
that's just all that I have
failure to say thank_you very much
failure to call spare
okay
oh ‡ maybe threes you say thank_you very much
continuity , law of fours
okay
partners in crime , law of fours
and why did you say those things
because there was already a four down
and law of fours because I put down a four
and these are yours Firstname
oh ‡ okay
continuity
because five is more than four by one
also it's a diamond
so I feel like I have_to put down another card
so I'm gonna play a two
I don't know why it's in my head that you have_to put down cards after
but it is
crazy eights , spare
okay
crazy eights , continuity
and
failure to say partners in crime
that too
and why did you say crazy eights and well continuity
crazy eights because it's an eight
and continuity because I had thought //
and I guess I still have this wrong
that Firstname put down a card of the same value as the continuity
so I wasn't sure if continuity would also be the same value
but maybe it can't be
so ‡ we're going clockwise
and it was Firstname's turn
and then she said "/
crazy eights
for putting out an eight
no ‡ at first it was going this way
and then she called "/
crazy eights
so it's your turn now
really
okay
partners in crime , crazy eights
so
spare
not your turn
partners in crime , crazy //
I_mean just crazy eights
failure to say spare
oops I said the rule wrong
I should have had law of fours
not your turn
I think I can put an eight down
I
what
have a nice day
partners in crime , have a nice day
failure to say "/
thank_you very much
why did you say partners in crime and have a nice day
partners in crime because it's the same value
and have a nice day because I thought sevens were have a nice days
right yes
but apparently sometimes they're also thank_you very much
thank_you very much
spare
continuity
spare
incorrect
why did you say spare
so I was thinking that a spare is something that's in the same suit
and it's more than like two numbers away from the card
so something was just like a random card that is in the same suit
continuity because it's one less
and because it's a five
continuity , law of fours
because it's one less
and because it's a four
continuity , law of fives
and why did you say that first one
because five is one more than four
and law of fives because I put down a five
and I put down another card because I put down a five
and I put down law of fours and call spare
unnecessary calling of spare
why did you say spare
because /
also you forgot to say continuity
oh yeah
I thought because it was like a sandwich like four or five or
mkay
I don't understand spare
yeah
continuity
and then we
okay
unnecessary placing of a card
no
really
okay
continuity , law of fours
and why
because four is one more than three
mhm
law of fours because it's a four
okay
continuity
law of fives
thank_you very much
why did you say thank_you very much
it's like a shot in the dark when you're looking at me
I either say have a nice day or thank_you very much
but I'm not sure so I alternate randomly
failure to place another card
okay
yes ‡ I see you looking at me
and I can tell you expect something further
and you're about to penalize me
so I pick one of the two and just say it randomly
can you place another card
failure to say continuity
there's no penalty for failing to say continuity
there is
but I wanna keep the stack
oh ‡ lame
I have so many cards
okay
continuity because three is one more than two
I just realized there's no aces or faces in here
mhm I paired down the deck
continuity because two is less than three
and just FYI I know
that's not a mechanism of the game
I'm just drawing to keep playing
okay
so ‡ that was my turn
oh ‡ okay
continuity
because
because three is one more than two
mkay
partners in crime
because it's the same as three
continuity because two is one less than three
have a nice day
crazy eights , continuity
failure to say thank_you very much
law of fours
continuity , law of fives
and why do you say that
because five is more than four , so continuity
and then whenever I put a five down I saw law of fives
okay
that's it
that's all I do
failure to place another card
okay
okay
okay ‡
partners in crime because they're the same suit
and law of fives because I put a five down
put down another card
have a nice day
why'd you say that
because it's a seven
okay
partners in crime , have a nice day
failure to say thank_you very much
spare
because seven plus three is ten
AKA a spare in bowling
oh
thank_you very much because Firstname put down a seven and told me to have a nice day
and the name of the game is Mao
but that's what you say when you win
mkay so ‡ now /
I think spare is the only thing I didn't figure out
I'm gonna call out the rules
and then tell me once again definitely I have an idea or not at all
partners in crime
definitely
definitely
continuity
definitely
definitely
law of fours
de^finitely
definitely
definitely
law of fives
definitely
definitely
have a nice day
definitely
no idea
crazy eights
maybe
sorta
and bowling
now definitely
sorta
okay ‡ I'll get the camera
mkay so once again thank_you guys very much for taking part in this experiment
once again I'm doing concept maps of how people learn
and it was kind_of hard to do because I can confound by you guys saying out like you did in the last game
that's why I had you write it down
I'll be going through those later
so each rule was
partners in crime is when the same value is placed
continuity is when a value one less or one greater is placed
the eight to two in normal Mao the ace to two you do say continuity
but in this one I took it out
okay
that's probably an oversight
law of fours is when you play it the person whose turn it is after you gets four cards
law of fives is when place a six correct you place another card
the one time I didn't give Firstname a card because
oh ‡ I gave him a card
but then he didn't place another one so we just moved on with our lives
sorry if that confused you
okay
have a nice day was when we placed a seven because there's seven days in a week
and then when you're receiving a seven you say thank_you very much
crazy eights skips the next person
and that's it
what was the Firstname easiest rule for you to learn
partners in crime
and why do you think that is
it was the very first one that happened
mkay
was it like /
like you put one down
Firstname put one down
you told him he was wrong
and then it was a pretty standard rule from there
yeah
okay ‡ what was the hardest for you to learn
which ones you could put down without having to have some connection to the other one
so the lack of rules
yeah ‡ the lack of rules hard
okay ‡
okay ‡ Firstname what was the easiest for you to learn
I think partners in crime and continuity were //
I think partners in crime came first and then continuity soon after
but the reasons were similar in that they could happen at any card
mhm
so ‡ they happened the most frequently
so ‡ you had the most like data points to interpret
mkay ‡ and what was the hardest for you to learn
law of fives apparently
because it seemed very often people would put fives and fours together
and it was hard to like separate those and experiment while playing
mhm
also sixes I had one six the whole game
I just didn't pay attention when anyone else put one down
and yeah and then at the very end you put one down
and it was like nothing
I think that was the first time I realized
the first time I put a six down and apparently it was partners in crime
oh ‡ okay
yeah ‡ there's no rules for sixes
is it like you can say partners in crime for sixes
oh ‡ no ‡ not the not like a full
okay ‡ just that there's not additional rules
yeah ‡ exactly
in regular Mao there is a rule there
but I took it out
there was supposed to be a rule called bowling , which is kind_of my fault
I'm sorry
and bowling is when two values add to ten you say spare
but we didn't get there
so yeah so thank_you guys for playing
also I was trying to figure out what suits were important for it when I stopped because it didn't seem like they were
doing anything
yeah ‡ once again in normal Mao you have_to match the suit
this one I took it out because it'd be a_little harder
final thoughts from Firstname about generally how you think your learning process went and what helped you learn better
where did things click for you
sometimes I try to do just random stuff
and I think that was helpful because a_lot_of the errors were very clear
mhm
I started writing down the areas like halfway here
and I started to pay a_lot more attention to that because I think that was like a_lot_of learning
like and saying unnecessary speaking was like
I couldn't figure that one out
but have a nice day after a five was
okay
could you repeat the question
I don't remember where I was going with that
oh ‡ it is final thoughts like what helped you learn more what clicked
when were things like "/
oh ‡ I know this now
I like the pace of our game being slow
I feel like if you play this in a group of people it's much faster
and I think write this down
let's see
laws of fours was pretty easy because there was like a distinct action following that
so ‡ that was like easy to pair those two together
looking back law of fives place it's the to place another card
okay
I didn't put that together
okay ‡ so ‡ you had a_lot_of errors with that which is what you said helped you learn
yep
but it's an interesting
but yeah
I_guess I didn't see the common thread
mkay
and Firstname same question what helped you learn the most and when did things seem to click
I tried to repeat everything that was correct and not repeat something else until Firstname made a mistake
and so it clicked when there was one where he made three mistakes at once
then I got most of the clues
okay ‡ and that was the three fives in a row „ I think
and /
he forgot to say thank_you very much and didn't have_to put another card down and didn't say continuity
okay
and yeah I think that was after a five
that seems like it
and then yeah I couldn't learn the cards with the rules because there's no mistakes with the rules
mhm
I had „ yeah
that was interesting
so ‡ yeah ‡ so ‡ how this worked is in my concept maps there are rules that are
so there's one_d two_d and three-d as in dimensional
so ‡ partners in crime and continuity are just one
you play it
boom that's the rule
the hardest then are law of fives and just law of fives because not only do you have_to recognize it but you have_to play something else after
that's like a two step
the middle tier of difficulty is the sevens for thank_you very much because it is a reaction for it
but it's just based on that card
so ‡ I think actually it goes with what you guys were saying where continuity and were easiest law of fives is hardest and in the middle somewhere you got the sevens and the eights which is kind_of what I was hoping for
cool
so ‡ thank_you so much for playing again
okay ‡ so this is play through number one
this is using cards two through eight
yeah ‡ because it's usually using the entire deck with a_lot_of rules
I'm pairing it down just so we get a_lot_of intermissions going
are we allowed to ask any questions
I'm not going to answer any of them unless like /
you just did
oh ‡ shit
I shouldn't have said shit
aw I said it again
said it again
okay
okay ‡ I'll pick this up
the name of the game is Mao
I'm calling rules
law of threes , law of fours
no ‡ I'm sorry
I'm gonna scoot back
the name of the game is Mao
I'm calling rules
law of fours , law of fives , continuity , partners in crime , have a nice day , and crazy eights

sure
okay
here we go
okay
we'll start assessing this time
partners in crime
definitely
definitely
continuity
definitely
almost definitely
law of fours
definitely
definitely
law of fives
definitely
almost definitely
have a nice day
definitely
definitely
crazy eights
definitely
definitely
great
okay
so ‡ this is game three speaking out loud
final game
what time is it
game time
two zero zero tenish
oh okay okay
I thought it was
okay ‡ here we go
yes ‡ we're playing cards
in a group study room
okay ‡ can you put the cards down please
the name of the game is Mao
I'll call the rules
law of fours law of fives partners in crime continuity have a nice day crazy eights and bowling
we're starting with Firstname and going clockwise
and remember we'll be speaking out loud our justification for each card placed
and the rules still must be said
partners in crime because the previous card is the same value
continuity law of fours because the previous card is a three
and because it's a four
I don't know if I should speak or not
okay ‡ I will speak
because
partners in crime because the previous card had the same value
continuity because the previous card was a two
partners in crime because the previous card has the same value
continuity because
wait „ no
just law of fours
failure to say continuity
okay
my justification for just law of fours is that you could do law of fours any time
partners in crime law of fours
and why'd you say those
oh ‡ because there's two of the same card
and it's a four
okay
continuity law of fives because it's one less than four
and it's a five
partners in crime law of fives because they're the same value
you didn't say why you did law of fives
what
you didn't /
because it's five
partners in crime and law of fives because it's yeah another five
have a nice day because it's a seven
thank_you very much because you said "/
have a nice day
have a nice day because it's a seven
and partners in crime because it's the same value
continuity thank_you very much because Firstname said "/
have a nice day
and because six is one less than seven
have a nice day continuity because seven is one more than six
and because it's a seven
thank_you very much and crazy eights
thank_you very much because the previous person said "/
have a nice day
and crazy eights because you can do it any time
continuity also because one above seven
boom
partners in crime crazy eights because they're the same value
and because it's an eight
partners in crime crazy eights and that phrase you say when you're out of cards that's something about Mao
because the name of the game is Mao
I'm gonna give you credit because Firstname helped you with that
but yes
oh ‡ oh ‡ my apologies „ camera
you placed an eight „ correct
yes
you placed an eight „ right Firstname
yeah
okay
oh ‡ do I go again
I pick up for my turn
it's not your turn
failure to go
partner in crime crazy eights because it's the same value
and it's an eight
and because I deduced it was my turn
continuity have a nice day
thank_you very much law of fives
law of fives partner in crime
thank_you very much because it was after seven
law of fives on each card because it was a five
and partners in crime on the second five because the previous value was also a five
failure to place another card
I'm gonna pick up for my turn
continuity because six is more than five by one
law of fours because you can place it any time
I've been forgetting the rule bowling so we'll play without it
yes
okay
continuity because three is less than four
is there no justification for that one
because I don't have to say anything
okay
oh
crazy eights because you can place it any time
there's no rule
I will draw a card
continuity have a nice day
because it's one greater than six
and it's a seven
thank_you very much the name of the game is Mao
when I said six
what
okay ‡ /
I guess I didn't have any sixes this whole game
I had one six
so ‡ we're gonna go through the rules again
if you guys could tell me with what certainty once again definitely I have an idea and no for each rule
start with Firstname this time
partners in crime
definitely
definitely
continuity
almost definitely
oh ‡ definitely
law of fours
definitely
definitely
law of fives
definitely
almost definitely
Firstname can I hear what you think law of fives is
sure ‡ I think you can place a five any time
that seems to be the only thing I've noted
and what do you think law of fives is
hm placing timed and if you place it you get another turn
except there is one time when Firstname didn't take another turn after he put it down which is why it's almost definitely
okay
have a nice day
definitely
definitely
crazy eights
definitely
definitely
okay ‡ good so ‡ now we're gonna stop here
which /
so my continuity I'm just not sure how the eight to two works
did I say continuity for that
no ‡ I'm curious
oh ‡ okay
that's like rule whether there is a rule there or not
oh ‡ okay
also I'm not sure how like triples or anything like that works
and what are gaps for you
there is the one with the five so Firstname didn't put another one down and the lack of rule for a six and putting it down any time
