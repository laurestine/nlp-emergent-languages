ah I mean its not necessary I dont really its theyre kinda open ended questions
yeah
how much do they want is the thing
like I think thats pretty good like that the family trees
I guess would it be redundant to say what exactly it means to be a big like in Zet
like as a mentor relationship
like that type of thin
or is that kinda understood
so hard to say
like to us I would think it would be understood
unless we had like some other special relationship that you know what I mea
like
right
if they had some other specific sort of role
yeah
what was the total number of new members for the school yea
so you have to include Cathy because they distinguish between new members and initiates so it was eight last semester
yeah
and six this semester
oh no my little got in a car accident
she got before spring break
no again during break
wow
wow
so I just say the number just like tha
yeah
I didnt know
should I like put it in a sentence or somethin
umm
we can
should we assum
hmm
Im just gonna write it out
we had seven initiates in the fall
we cant be too careful
we had seven initiates in the fall out of eight new members
and we have
should we say like that should we just give a date or should we say initiation is after
its in mid April just say that
on April
this is what Im gonna put up over my bed
yeah
so hot
hes got gray hair
I think its just light in the picture
no I think hes got gray hair
no I think its just the light in the picture
okay
frankly
around his temple
yeah I think thats just light in the picture
like right her
okay
and we currently have six
oh
isnt he uh pursuing Britney Spear
I heard he was
she sprained her back neck wrists and hands and bruised a rib
your littl
yes
she cant walk without being in pain
awoah
I think I should say our new member education program is scheduled to end in mid April not actually say anything about initiation itself
okay
um
this is the part where I get scared
did your chapter sponsor any educational programs this year on health or wellness issues such as alcohol drugs hivaids eating disorders abusive relationships gambling tobacco use or time management
no
no
kati did the love your body workshop
um
ah
thats not quite the same though
its no like
sponsoring would be like a campus wide event
right
did Panhe
well I guess if Panhel sponsors something we cant really claim it
yeah
um
um
hmm
I looked at that and I was like uh that sucks because I hope everyone says no
oh she hit a deer
oh my God
oh thats impossible to avoid
in a car acciden
oh yeah
yeah
oh
I mean
oh the deer was dead on the side of the New York freeway
five thousand dollars worth of damag
hmm
yeah
the reasons that he exploded in my car
the deer explode
apparently
thats disgusting
thats kinda ah
is there anything we can stretch
yeah I was just about to say that
um
hmm
hmm
I think the love your body workshop possibly touched upon eating disorders
sure the workshop is something
its something
I wasnt there
were you there Maggie
no
um sure
well it can touch upon whatever we say it touches upon
so uh um
we can say that last semester we sponsored a chapter
this is why I need you
youre good at wording things
okay
Id like to think so
that is my major
I know
thats why I was like Anna should help me
this applications a lot of work
it really is
I was like nope not doing it by myself
okay we sponsored a chapter workshop
um
wait he exploded on her car not in her car
yeah but it exploded
yeah
yeah but exploded being the key word
yeah
I wouldnt even want my car after that
anna would be like all right done
time for a new car
okay
um
uh we sponsored a chapter workshop about body image
body image and overall health and well being
there ya go
thats beautiful
oh
he has Chicago
oh I wonder if hes got
I wanna see it in the theaters though again
I was gonna say didnt you already see it
I did
I wanna see it again
Ill go with you
I havent
oh right because you havent seen it
I know I know I suck
yeah you suck
um entitled eh
like new sentence
you wanna say like entitled the I Love My Body Workshop um
we can type
obviously
um the event
what did it d
um
strengthened self image
strengthened our sisters self image and
das
yeah
self image and
and was educational
um it was a huge success and we plan to do it again in the future
I know it wasnt but
all right we can get rid of huge then
it was a success
it was a success
and we plan to hold this event again in the future
is that the sign from when your car got towe
the visitor parking on
no thats not
thats from a long time ago
okay I was gonna say that would have been a nice souvenir
I think instead I just have my uh bill
you got it all reimbursed
I got reimbursed yeah
but its not like the original bill
oh right
maggie I think after hanging out with you for a week straight Im playing with my hair a lot more often
I know
Im sorry
you have to smell
yummy
what is tha
you wanna smell xx
it does smell pretty
its Charles Worthington Results
and its the moisture seal glossing shampoo and the everyday shine conditioner
well
and when youre in the shower and you put it on it smells like mens cologne
I dunno why
yeah I was gonna say it does smell like
I dont think Jeff can complain about me smelling too great
I dunno if thats bad or
okay so
is there anything
Im thinking that we can stretch something into being time management
just because like I know that our vice president is usually very active with the sisters individually
right well
about time management
that will go in the scholarship section
oh true
christy wrote like she actually didnt do what I asked her to do
she didnt put it into the form
but she wrote like a three page essay about
sweet
our scholarship so
we have good scholarship I think
yeah we have really good scholarship
she wanted an espresso Im like
but wh
it kept her up so long in Mexico I couldnt sleep
you couldnt sleep or she couldnt slee
she kept pestering me
wait the espresso kept her up so you couldnt slee
exactly
but what she said was that the espresso kept both of you up and both of you couldnt sleep
in a way
until three am
in a way it kept the both of us up
oh well she wasnt that explicit
only she drank the espress
no no we both drank the espresso
she never drank espresso before
right bad idea
can go for another couple more actually
ok lah lets have a drinking contest
well I wouldnt mind its just
how is i
its not bad know its actually good
its just that its a dollar thirtyfive for one shot so Im like
thats cheap
it i
its fifteen pesos
I donno I cant remember what the prices are in Singapore
fifteen pesos not cheap what
its not cheap
mexican coffee is very strong
I was so happy to find out
very very strong
did I tell yo
they have two types
they have cafe americano cafe mexicana
americano is the normal dilute one then you get the mexicana
I saw that I saw that in Paris as well when I was in Paris
did I tell you about thi
I went into this coffee shop and I ordered coffee and the guy asked me whether I wanted american coffee or coffee
I was like of course I want coffee
no I dont get it why would he ask you whether you wanted american coffee without knowing if you were american or not
it was a touristy place
oh I see I see
you know you tend to
I suppose they tend to assume that whoever walks in is american or has american tendencies
even though I was quite obviously asian
youre either american or japanese thats it
there are only two people in this world
and you said of course you want coffee
er yah so the guy served me the french what the french drink
do you have kopi
no they dont
I would say no they dont have kopio
their default idea for coffee is espresso
thats kopio what
I thought you meant they added milk into everything
no theres a difference
no no kopio is just coffee without milk righ
ok if you refer to that as kopio then ok fine
yah what it is what
no not exactly it has to be prepared in that hawker center style
in that mug you know the mugh with the indentations on the side
yes yes yes the glass mug
the sugar cane center mug
with the insulating tape on the handle
no no no no no
nowadays thats what they come as but what five six years ago it
it used to be a bigger version of this righ
thats the way it should be yah man
and then you get this plastic spoon thats like a smaller version of your soup spoon remember tha
yah that is the way to go
and then my grandfather would pour it out of the saucer
my father would pour it out in the saucer then I would drink it from the saucer then he would drink it from the cup yah
yes yes thats how we started drinking coffee righ
thats how I started drinking tea
older relative says want or not I pour it into the I pour it into the saucer for you then you drink it from the saucer
doesnt taste as good anymore you know
when I was growing up it tasted so much better
it always does lah
actually when I was growing up everything tasted good yah youre right
you usually reach a certain stage in your life when you start to differentiate between things tasting good and bad as in the same kind of food served to you
lets say you get like three plates of char kuay teow from different places I dunno thats what happens for me
vegetables always tasted bad to me
because if we make it flat the back leg is going to have to go through the bag
yeah
thats why I ask
thats the only thing is like the way our structure works like the way its rigid and stuff kind of gets messed up
so
I think we could keep the v shape
ah I think the v is fine
okay
um
the one thing we definitely have to do though is lower the thing
we could do that
I think we definitely should do that
cause the
so brooms if its the long brooms were talking about theyre not very high anyway
yeah
yeah
theyre only like that long
so if theyre only gonna touch the ground or like barely touch the ground then it has to be like wha
two inches off the ground mayb
at most
I dont know
we can probably almost get it down to like an inch off the ground
something like that
I dont think we need it that
but I dont think I dont I dont think we need it quite that extreme
something like two or three inches three inches maybe
three inches off the ground would be good
I think the lower the better just because that means theyll be left less leaves collected in front at the end
does that mean we
and it also means theres we want our prototype to work on flat surface
lower the better
how
only on flat
yeah thats true
howre we gonna tackle flat surfaces the
hm
what do you mea
or not uneven surfaces sorry
well because the tines arent gonna be touching
like howre we gonna try
its gonna be like
yeah
a centimeter or two off the ground
yeah
the brushes like it could conform to the surface
yeah the brush will catch anything
thats uneven
so itll just have the brushes
a little bit bent
well yeah its gonna bend back because of the grass
its gonna bend back naturally but make it like prebent though
oh
is what Im saying
like so if it were flat even ground it would be bent back already a little bit
and then like if its like a little bit of a hill or a mound or whatever
I think itll just bend back because uh its going against the grass
mmhmm
its gotta be some sort of
like Im assuming its soft bristle
yeah
because hard bristle is gonna damage the grass so we wouldnt
yeah
wanna use that anyway
yeah
but like yeah even if its straight down in the beginning once it starts moving itll like curve back anyway
but hopefully it wont curve back too much
so we need to get some brushes or brooms or whatever
yeah
we need to look into materials that we could use for that too
what do you mean material
well you can get brooms with all kinds of different stuff
I mean
you can get like
different kinds of bristles you mean
yeah
yeah
you can get like horsehair brooms
you can get like
right right
fake horsehair
well
ah you can get like
lets go with the cheapest well something thats stiff but you know well also flexible
well I dont know whats out there I dont know
so balanceful
I have I have a broom thats made out of basically just straw kinda and I mean it works great as a broom but definitely wouldnt work for this
so
okay
alright so what are we asking tomorrow Steif
so
frame rigidity
rigidity
what time is he availabl
one thirty to three
one thirty to three
so were going straight after our classes
straight after classes
I have a little thing so Ill be a little late
so I was thinking one forty five
I imdyou one forty five righ
how about
I guess so
we just go at twelve then
how about
or
we go
two at two
yeah
okay
yeah how about we go to Newell Simon
okay
get food
yeah
and we meet you there at two or something
okay
so does that sound goo
do you have a lunch break at any time during the da
alright
um
so what are we asking him
uh frame frame rigidity
uh frame longevity I dunno
do you think shocks would be goo
well
well those are the things we would have to ask him about
we well tell him we should estimate how much weight theres going to be on the bolts
okay
and probably ask him about sheer of the bolts at the bottom where its connected to the uh the runners
and then the other thing is bending of the uh the frame
as its pulling the ne
as the ropes are pulling the sides forward and the bag is pulling the center back
yeah
slight will it go like this eventually sometime
crunch or something like that
because I mean were already like this
like
its going like that kind of
well I dunno maybe I dunno
so
cause the bag is attached all around the frame
the thing is do we really need
well I think
to ask him about all of those thing
well
like we should be able to do that ourselves
right
that stuff we should but like if theres any uncertainty
no but he he can give us advise like
like a good way to estimate i
ah But yeah like a good way to estimate
or a better equation to use or
we should
something
wait we cant estimate that no
how heavy is our thin
twenty thirty pounds mayb
uh I guestimated guess and estimated twenty
thats
okay twenty
but
thats something we should do too we should figure out how heavy our thing is
but like if we have the weight we have three points
assuming each point has the same load on it if its a flat surface
then we could take the one in the back which is a straight down force and then the other two is like an angle force and the angle we kinda know
so we should be able to find the sheer stresses on it
or we should as him if that is completely correct I dunno
beause the bag isnt you know attached at the center its attached all around
and whats the other thing I remembe
in the first few days in the nursery we had some relatives
but when you werent with me and you were in the nursery and they went in there and they saw you like lifting up your head as a little bit and turning it a little bit
more than most babies most babies dont do that right away
and just trying to see as much as you could because you were excited about having come into the world
and you wanted to see as much of it as you could
and it was just a very exciting thing meeting you at that time and getting to know you
as an infant
and it was amazing
so lets see
what else
you wanna know what you were like when you were littl
and you were growing up
you were easy in some ways
you were really easy because you didnt cry very much
you had a melodious and sweet voice and you used it to cry just enough to get my attention to do something you needed to have done
and then you would quiet down and look peaceful and happy because you got what you needed
hugging you hugging was always wonderful
I remember you being draped over my shoulder a lot
because that was the position that we enjoyed
you enjoyed it and I enjoyed it
and so youd have your tummy against my body and youd have your head against my shoulder and youd fall asleep on my shoulder
for a few years
and I think those are times when we both felt very peaceful and very happy
and I know it was for me some of the most beautiful days of my life
okay
you want me to move on here with what was happening little later on
sure Ill do that
um well there are some things I feel a little bad about that if I could do it over again I woulda wanted to improve
but whatever was not quite good maybe it had good things that went along with it too
you see I didnt drive a car you remember that
you remember tha
sure
of course
I didnt drive the car until you were in kindergarten
so we were sorta stuck in the house
more than most people and just sort of dependent on who was in our neighborhood
and um yeah we met a few neighbors with children and they werent necessarily the choices of people that we would have chosen if we had a car but we did spend some time with them and it wasnt so bad and it was nice walking around the neighborhood we did a lot of walking remember you were willing to walk
and after the stroller and you got walking we did a lot of walking
and it was nice days and pretty days and enjoying the nature
tryin ta think
but we couldnt do a lot of things because we didnt have the car
so um ok anyway in that time period that was when your sister was born we spent a lot of time with you you learned to read when you were very young because we spent time together doing that and
you were smart anyway
we found a way to go to the gym school
finally when you were getting almost old enough to get to kindergarten
because you had never had nursery school you never had preschool or nursery school or anything we got you into the gym school one day a week by taxi
and it was good at first
you were so enthusiastic
you loved doing everything that they had you do
until there was this boy who was nasty
and the school wanted to separate the two of you
and we couldnt do it because there was only one time slot when I could get you over to the gym and then Dad could come by the taxi and then Dad could come and pick you up
boy
it was too bad because it sort of spoiled this wonderful gym experience that you were having
and I was wishing that I could drive and I could have more flexibility and you were sort of stuck with this situation but it was still better than not doing it at all and then you went to kindergarten
and then guess what you were a little too smart for kindergarten
by that time kindergarten into first grade and then of course you skipped a grade
which in itself was a good thing and a bad thing all at the same time because socially it was a little tough
and right at that period of time Grampy also died
so a lot of things were happening
and you had a little bit of a hard time but you got through it
you managed
you were amazing
you were amazing
and you conquered what needed to be conquered with all the emotions and you got through it and you were successful and you started to make friends
and eventually you really made some good friends
you really did
it took a while but one by one you picked up good friends who are still your friends
remember Alliso
your friend Allison she started way back there in first and second grade
and then you picked up more friends as you went along and theyre still your friends I think its amazing that you picked up friends way back then and theyre still with you
so many years later and I think its wonderful and I hope they stay friends with you for the rest of their lives and your life
alright can you still hear m
I feel my voice is like
I need a breath
okay here I am back
okay um okay
well anyway my point is sometimes that if I had to do it over again if I had to do it over again wouldnt I want to make it more perfect for you
wouldnt I want to get you more lessons wouldnt I want to get you more more freedom of movement where we could travel more where you could see more places and sure I would
on the other hand maybe we can look back and we can say alright whatever it was it was maybe there were some things that were a little bit restrictive maybe but maybe because of that there were also things that were good and we could get closer
and we could we did other things and you became more independent and more diligent and things may have happened
closeness with each other that wouldnt have happened otherwise
maybe you wouldnt have ended up able to be who you are as easily if you had been out there with me driving you around maybe you wouldnt have become who you are
maybe you would have become a slightly different person
so who knows
and so I would like to think that whenever anything happens thats sort of not perfect that there is some perfection to it anyway
and all I know is this
all I know is that Courtney you have turned into a beautiful wonderful person
youre pretty independent now
youre diligent youre reliable youre successful but youre warm and youre loving and youre a joy to be near
youre always a joy to be near and to spend time with
I love being with you
I miss you out there in Pittsburgh because I wish you were here but Im Im proud of you for what youre doing

okay allright whats next on the agenda uh folks
sigh
um I dont know
I thought that would take a long time
hhh
yeah
hhh
do you do you want to do this agai
youre awake now
no do you want to do it agai
hhh
Ill pass
hhh
hhh
maybe it goes here
maybe it goes here
oh thats weird
under her
yeah
okay
one more
oh oh my
well it is sorta too bad we dont have a nifty video to watch
yeah I guess the place isnt open hu
well it may be
well I really wanted to see a movie I must tell you that
I even wanted to go out and see one
and it is early enough to still to do that
um well we could well lets see
you know what that movie thats on at the Arts Cinema
the Arts Cinema
somebody Who Wasnt There or
uh i the papers out her
uh Idunno
its in the
living room
living roo
you both did real well together I thought
really good
yeah
the only one
we were pretty good
the only one that really
sort of embarrasses me is turgid and turbid
cause the other one you might expect not to get
I was a lil
yeah I was a little surprised you didnt get that one I must admit
yeah The Man Who Wasnt There
is on and Glitter is on at seven fifteen at the Art Theater
and The Man Who Wasnt There
is sort of a take off I think on films noires
um
man Who Wasnt
well it doesnt have It doesnt
it was time the first time
thats the other side
oops
because uh uh The one thats on um at five thirty at the Art Theater called Glitter
says
a truly dreadful film about a singers rise to fame with Mariah Carey looking as though shes afraid of the camera all the way through
oh
but it doesnt say
hhh
oh they also have other ones like Monster is a fourstar movie and so is
yea
so is that movie about
oh The Monster is cute
its you know thats a a childrens movie righ
mhmm have you seen it
no but its supposed to be cute
its its
um wait minute found it
its all computer animated like Toy Story
okay its on at Hoyts and its on
well its on at seven fifteen at Town Square
ummm
it depends on if you want to see a kids movie
it prolly wont be quite as good as Shrek
did you ever see Shre
no did you see i
uh huh dyou see i
yeah
shrek was is on at the Cinema Saver but only in the afternoon
mmm
well yeah
toda
I saw that on the airplane flying somewhere
really huh
oh reall
sss
where were you goin
oh Germany or something
oh yeah
hm did you all see Serendipit
yes
yeah
it was kinda not that good hhh
it was okay
bandits
oh Bandits very good
a meaty love story full of odd well developed character
well lets see what time its on
bandits is on at seven fitee ah
seven fifteen Friday through Sunday
and today
thursday
six fifteen Monday through Thursday
nnunno around six fourtyfive
so its probably not on
thats at the Cinema Saver thats too bad
I guess we could call em to make sure
or we could call the Video King
a meaty love story full of odd well deve well developed characters is a source of unexpected humor in this quirky delightful film about a trio of unlikely bank robbers
too bad
call Video King for what purpos
see if theyre open
I betcha theyre open
theyre probably open
oh I bet theyre open and also
reall
even on Thanksgivin
yeah
yeah Im about to decide too that um Hollywood Video has more choices
its true
I just figure Video King is the smaller chain
hhh
but its true Hollywood Video probably does have more choices
dyou have a Hollywood Video car
mhmm
kay
Ill go with you if we do that
we can all go
do you want to do tha
okay sure
yeah
yeah I mean that
that may be more fun sitting around here than going to a movie theater what do you thin
I think so
I think so
yeah we could see this The Man Who Wasnt There
I dont know we could make that at seven fifteen
uh Bandits is on there at nine thirty but thats a little late
yeah
the Man Who Wasnt There is a fun movie
mhmm
whats The Man Who Wasnt Ther
well I dont know they dont have a write up about it that I can find
oh yeah
thats the one with Kevin Spacey mayb
no um uh no thats something about
its the Cohen Brothers
kevin Spaceys an alien thats another one I think
oh yeah thats somethin different
it no theres no write up this time about it
unless its under the
no man
no it it goes from Heist to Monsters
they had it written up last time
they had a whole full review of it last time and they kinda and they liked it
though the New Yorker doesnt give it a real good review the New Yorkers pretty oh wait lminute
they call it
I know
here it is
sorry its four it gets four stars
a barbers plan for blackmail uh backfires in this superb filme noire written by the Cohen brothers
starring Billy Bob Thornton Frances McDormond and James Gal Galdolfini
hmm
what does it say agai
its a good movie
the real question is whether you wanta
its rated R for violence
a barbers plan for blackmail backfires in this superb film noire written by the Cohen brothers
whats a filme noir
black film sort of dark humor
yeah you member that Hard Hard Rock West film that we saw
in New York that tim
yes
thats a filme noire
I see
I always confuse that with The Rock
hhh
hhh which is a very different film
um okay
its really
who are the Cohen brother
theyre the ones that did Fargo
oh I see
and Frances McDormond was she was the woman in Fargo
that sort of film
hmm pretty neat movie
mhmm mhmm
so its its really a matter of weighing that in particular against here and a might be yet unknown
yeah I mean renting a video is kind of nice
yeah I think we kind of want to rent one
we can sit around and stuff
so why dont we all go
mmm okay
lets all go and pick out a movie
itll be an outing
because its our outing for the day

its lost per se in the piece just to the general appearance of there uhm
Im confused by that a little bit
because you say you want more room to breathe but then youre youre sayingthat the individual is lost and so
well Im saying
why like yknow to to make it more individualized to associate a person with it makes it more specific not more open and so how do how do you how do you give us more room to breathe how do you give the implied person or the viewer or the artist more room to breathe while making it at the same time more specific and more individualized
well youre like tagging on these objects a kind of like specific image
youre not letting the pieces illustrate their own individuality when you when you put these images on them youre kind of like this was found here yknow this is what it is yknow and it doesnt like and it doesnt let the worn quality of the shirt speak for itself or yknow i
but
but it sounds like youre youre proposing two different options for the way these things can work and youre siding with one of the options and option one is that you use the photographic information to make the objects reveal more of what they are uhm option two is more of a contrast kinda thing where where the images are very diffferent from the objects that theyre on and they reveal something else through that contrast so i guess does anybody else see the contrast in a different way than Jb is there another read on this thing
to compare with jbs
I have a a less of a problem with the images on the objects and more of a formal issue the one thing i would ask is i think whats beautiful about is that you stop seeing the objects and each one of these images becomes like what we project onto things and i would just like to see them fill the object thats all
when they do I think theyre really powerful because its like one has stopped seeing and theyre just projecting this nostalgia of like loss or emptiness or wanting to leave that the railroad has been its its i like it because it has this kind of irony the railroad has been abused as a metaphor and yet onthese objects the images are kinda so beautiful that they hold to where you almost have to cope with that still as a potential metaphor but when its framed like this to me then it becomes more of a picture and when it starts to fill that space like there on the skateboard even on the uh scale then it seems to just be it seems to you almost lose what the object is and it just all things become surfaces for the projection of desire or something what wed like to have happen so
alright Stu dont you like Minneapolis
oh let me tell you how much I like that city which we call Minneapolis
a lot thats how much
alright so youre all like let me
yeah I get out kinda early the twelfth I think
and then I want to go there and start working before the end of May
okay um yeah I have finals until the thirteenth
and program doesnt start until June sixteenth
and you cannot vacation after the sixteent
no
which sucks cause it would be better to
start early and then leave and come back
like i dont know
perhaps I could go somewhere with you like the week before your program whats the sixteenth is that a Monda
I dunno
lets find out
mmmmhmmm yes its a Monday
okay ummmm
theres a lot of weeks in here dude
one week two weeks
yeah thats like a month
three weeks four weeks
yeah thats thats four weeks five weeks
thats like four and a half weeks
yeah
so thats yeah Im not gonna not work for a month
yeah
that would suck
um
Im not gonna sit in Minneapolis looking at your pretty pretty face for a month though
so you could play in Minneapolis
play in Minneapolis by myself
I dont know uhhh like I could start working as late as maybe Monday the twentysixth
maybe Monday the twentysixth
uhhh were you planning on going to New Haven at al
uhh I have to go for like a quick haircut dental appointment and dermatologist thingy
oh yea
yeah
okay
so like were you planning on like spending time being like hellooo family and friends
uhhh my mom wants a week Im going for like three or four days
okay so iunno
like I figure if we arrive we drive up over the weekend to arrive on the twentysixth and I
start working on the twentyeighth thatll work for me
mmmkay
like I wanna make sure we drive up together because thats a long drive
like my Mother says her family used to do it in three days from Cleveland
I think your Moms crazy
yeah she also said it was onethousand miles
how long is i
I dont know we could look it up
let us use the internet
ahhh
whoa this is not my keyboard Stu
Im sorry
this is very confusing
Ill grab the right one next time
yeah dude Im all tryin to find the arrow keys
yeah those are really annoying arrow keys
yeah dude
wha
I dont know you use the arrow keys a lot
yeah I do you never realize it until its gone
wha
dont piss Kerry off
oh I did not realize
whatever
youre repeating yourself
yeah i thought that would help the dialogue you know emphasis
righto
something righto
uhhh it is eighthundredseventyseven miles
thats a long way
its not completely ridiculous from onethousand
anyway
look at this calendar more
yes we drive up over the weekend so then Id say no more than two days
okay I was also thinking like if I I could visit Warren
you know
yeah
sometime so like I could drive up there with you and spend like time settling in and being like oh Stu like that
and then um like leave and come back in time like take a plane from Minneapolis to Las Vegas and back
yeah I think that might be good
so youd go like first or second week in April er March
may June
may June yeah ha hah good job ummm
yeah I could totally do that
that way I wont be sitting in Minneapolis bored forever
alright so Ill tell her like so when do you want to arrive the
arrive at uhhh
minneapolis
ummm
cause like I really dont wanna spend more than like that I wanna get out of New Haven by like the sixteenth
by the sixteent
mmmhmmm so I dont know I could go and hang with Rori for a week
uhhh well I dont know
I dont know before you were talking about you wanted to spend like some ridiculous number of weeks like fifteen weeks doing work this Summer
yeah
like theres not even fifteen weeks in the world in the summer is ther
uhh I dont know that was the number of weeks she said
oh I see
so I dont know we could like you could we could leave Pittsburgh such that you could start work on the twentysixth
like we could leave Pittsburgh on the twentieth or something
mmhmm drive up arrive on the twentysecond settle in over the weekend start on the twentysixth
mmmhmm
man I have a long time in Minneapolis with nothing to do
I really dont think it would be that bad youve got like a new city and a car and nothing to do
yeah maybe Ill just be like lalalalalalala
therell probably be other kids from your program who already arrived and you can go play with them
well if I know who they are
yeah you could find them probably
I dont know about that Stu
find some punk rock shows something like that
in Minneapolis
minneapolis punk rock
yeah okay so that would be like one week two weeks three whole weeks and some extra that I would be sitting in a city
being like Im sure here I could spend like at most one of them in Las Vegas
yeah so its two weeks of nothing to do except have fun
except have fun maybe Ill go to Las Vegas and then like drive out to California by myself
go swimming
mmmkay Rori
so you would youd want to get out of there like the week from first the seventh or something
yeah I guess so
that would probably work
I could even get to Minneapolis later than that
rori thats not cool cause then I have to do all the moving in
well I could
I dont know I could buy way too many plane tickets and have no money
wait I dont understand what are you thinkin
um I just like I could go there with you and move in and drive there with you and everything
and then I can like go to Las Vegas visit Warren then go back to Dc or something like that and then fly back to Minneapolis
woah three plane tickets
three plane tickets thats a lot
Ive only been on planes twice ever
yeah reall
yeah
wow
ah to and from Hawaii or somethin
no to and from Denver Colorado
when did Hawaii come in plac
uh took boats
oh wow where did you go to from Denver Colorad
um my sister uhhh in like senior year or something of high school my sisters company had this like convention in Denver Colorado
that they were hosting and she was like come with me and sit behind this table and look pretty and get paid like fifteen dollars an hour
for doing wha
sitting behind a table and looking pretty
no really
like really thats it like people come up and say hey how you doin I be like okay
then theyd leave that was it
woah are you youre wha
no I would like I dont know I was
you were a spokesperso
something where theyd like uh
a booth gir
information person or something
mmmkay
yep
thats pretty cool the company gave us like fiftyfive dollars a day on which to spend food
mmmhmmm
so everyone got ridiculous food at the time
cool
thats a lot of money they
fiftyfive dollar
yeah
seriously
I could spend fiftyfive dollars a day on food
youd buy eat like very nice food all the time man though its just you its not you and anyone else its just you
yeah
like you always eat that much of course
I could always I could probably yeah twenty dollars on a meal is
a lot
thats nice food
yeah thats nice food and you do that like
I dont know I could spend
you know three times a day
fifteen on breakfast thirty on dinner
that leaves like ten dollars for lunch its a little short
its a little shor
jesus
of like what I would consider very good food
I dont know
it would probably be like sixtyfive a day I think as much I as I would want to
like everyone kept on like asking restaurants if they could buy bottles of wine and take them home
so that they could you know
yeah
put on their food allowance the bottles of wine and everything
yeah and the restaurant sai

oh my god Im getting heres heres a someone for you
Im getting married this summer and plan to wear strappy sandals with my gown
do I need to wear hose with my shoe
if so what styl
they start off okay and then they quickly go downhill
wearing hosiery with sandals is not the most attractive option
but it is more comfortable
youre going to have those shoes on for at least five hours and
wearing hose may cut down on sweating chafing and blistering feet
if your feet do those things theyre gross and should be amputated
what isnt that what Sara would do she would wear um
yes
shoe
those shoes and wear
I kinda
this is ridiculous this is all ideas for Philadelphia and
why would you be grandm

wh
ilanas oldest brother
oh Donny Donny

I see
its a different people different name
for me its the same D A N
by the way I dont know what does it mean flaky
flaky Flaky means sort of
undependable
undependable
I understand that its not good something
yeah
but rather by tone your voice
you never know what youre going to get from them
unpredictable
unpredictable
its sort of spacey
I mean its not totally perjorative
it You know if somebody is flaky they might be kind of off in their own little world
ah I see
what is the expression to four minute mile or whateve
tica tica tica wooo
yeah the four minute mile was the unbeatable mile
that was the
some tea please
the four minute mile was the unbreakable record that a
I I forget what the guys name
no there is such an expression as this
is there for the four minute mil
no I mean
so if to make a four minute mile is to make some great achievements
oh sure
I dont remember what
no no no
I mean not not literally
oh right right right
yes yes thats true
its like when youre talking about ah
you know when you talk about um
doing something doing something that previously thought you couldnt do
yes
its like breaking the four minute mile
because for a long time people thought you couldnt do it until ah
a British psychologist I think it was proved them wrong
he he thought it was all mental
and he went out and he run ran faster than a four minute mile
I found out translation it is so hard
once my professor eh does some paper about him
he was a member of Academy of Science American Academy
he was invited in Russia
and in newspaper they publish something about him
he brought this paper for me and he told me
Could you translate i
I said
oh yeah
I took it
oh newspapers are hard
I was not able
I told him in general what it is but it was not a translation
you know what I did it
you gave him a summary Yeah
yes You know what I didnt even realize it
newspaper articles are very difficult
I thought
okay I speak fluently English
oh oh oh
were you trying to translate into English or into Russia
I was shocked yeah
into Englis
I was not able
I brought it home
simon helped me
it took us probably thirty minutes about one hour to translate very small article because he needs to know exactly terms
for him it was important how they see him
because he wanted to be a member of Russian Academy of Science
for him it was how you know they present
perceived him Right
that means I cannot in just general terms tell him what this is about
right right right
and he realize it right away
he told me
you know what
you told me shortly but please take it home and translate it for me
since that time I thought I would not go to this business
I thought you know when I would retired I might as a hobby

yeah why do you hate i
I just hated all the people that worked there
oh youre like
youre like big tits small blah blah
yeah like not good Like its certainly I dunno to me its like part of the Shadyside scene that people are like oh Im fabulous
is that how it is over ther
yeah
and Im just like youre in Pittsburgh
is it really is it expensiv
I dunno I only ordered beers
I would imagine it would be
and have you ever eaten at Walnut Gril
I havent eaten there I heard it was okay
its not even okay
reall
no and people like fawn over it I really dont understand but
just because of where it is
where it is
and its shadyside and you can go there and be fabulous
and be seen
I like PDC its cheap
I like PDC I dunno if its really that cheap is i
well its its like cheap for Shadyside
its the same company
is i
spending three dollars on a half a sandwich or like you know ha like
yeah
during every day and only three dollars on like a whole sandwich from nine to eleven is like kind of peakish time isnt i
I didnt understand that check at all last night
me neither
like two of our drinks were on there we couldnt tell if it was three fifty before the promotion after the promotion
and then there was like eleven unexplained dollars
three times four is twelve plus three is fifteen no that makes sense then
does i
yeah
oh well our drinks were probably
four fifty donw to three fifty
no I think three fifty down to two fifty
so round it up to three bucks
so times four is twelve and another
four bucks and that
but why wasnt it liste
I dunno
well

I have get like i have to do my own like thing
I dont know well see how far well how far is U University of Miami from your hous
half hour
thats not bad
I gotta talk to this girl online shes money in the bank
are you workin
yeah im working for that same guy I worked for last summer that civil engineer pretty much just outside all day
diggin in the dirt
when are you gunna work out
I work out after work like six or seven at night
how tired are yo
well prodigiously tired
your workouts must suck then
no actually they dont
I get myself pumped up ready to go
we start at like Iwork from like six in the morning until like freakin four five
thats a lot of hours
yeah
five days a week we go lift
yes you are a freak of nature
thank you
your eyebrows are growing back though
I had them done
there is no violence
I had
wait
I had them done over break I was growing them and then they got really bushy and I went and had a woman do them and this is the shape she gave me
right theyre present and thats a good thing
thank you
before you had them
I had them so thin
so that they covered a third of your eye
I know I liked the thin look for awhile now I like em thicker I guess but yeah
you need to have them present
I know
like
actually theres this one salon I went into here in Pittsburgh and theyre like yeah n if you come in and get your eyebrows waxed well make them darker like they would dye the eyebrow color
they can do tha
thats weird
I guess so
yeah I guess they can
n I thought that would be kinda neat cuz like I do have very light eyebrows n even no matter how thick they get if the sun hits them or light hits them in a way it doesnt matter how much hair is there like you wont see them
yes but you have a better chance of seeing them now that theyre there
I understand
then when they were actually gone
thank you mister brian
its better than like those people that like get rid of them completely and then draw them in with pencil
oh my god that lookss so horrible
thats so bizarre
what are they thinkin
I dont know
man
same thing you were thinking when you plucked em down to nothing
no I kept plucking because I wanted to make them even and then I would like pluck one wrong and it would have to and then it would just
thats like this one girl Murray and I used to know
it was like you just keep going
you could like this one time we were at dinner and he like just looked at her like across the table just started staring at her and shes like what what are you looking at n she got all self conscious and hes like your eyebrows are uneven and she like was like so upset and embarrassed that she like ran away and left the table n
oh my god thats horrible
murray has a tendency of make girls cry
really
its a a ya know a talent
because he just says the wrong thing
hes blunt
very blunt
nah I mean hes hes getting better but ya know sometimes when when he doesnt care he can be pretty blunt
actually he was never blunt when I was around
because he liked you
oh
if you if you bother him or piss him off
then hell be blunt
then he he can go out of his way to be mean to you
gottcha
yeah
I thought he was sweet
hes a sweet guy
he is
murrays a teddy bear
is he
but yeah hes just rough around the edges
I understand most guys are
you wouldve whipped him into shape
would I no
yeah
Im not very good at whipping guys
whip it whip it good
Im not very good at that
well
I dont have like the patience or desire to whip a guy
I know you need to find the guy that like is exactly suited for you because nobody else will really do because you cant cant work with them
but I wont change them
theres like one person in the world whos really gonna work for you
I know isnt that horrible
I guess
cuz it makes my chances of finding them so much harder
no I just think that some people dont realize that not everybodys perfect and youre never going to find somebody thats perfect for you
you just have to find somebody that makes you happy
compatible
and you can you know you can change and evolve and interact with
I understand that nobodys perfect Im not even close to saying Im perfect I know I have plenty of faults
people like have this thing where they like exactly imagine who who it is that theyre going to be with like he has to be this this this ya know like thats not how it is ya just
I know I just ask for simple things and I just dont I dont think Ive gotten the simple things I mean
maybe youre not looking in the right places
maybe Im not
maybe Ive just or maybe its just a matter of the guys I attract I dont know
maybe
I mean
I dont know I thought Andy was a a close approximation but like just screwed it up you like
I know I screwed it up
you just didnt do much with it
I know I screwed it up majorly at the movies
I realize that
no it wasnt definitively at the movies
it was an in it was over time because he kept coming back you just ya know you kept discouraging him
I didnt mean to
I just guys cant play a game with me because Im not good at reading signals so they just have to be forward I just need a guy to say look I want to go out ya know and I would give him so many opportunities
but then when they so look Carolyn I want to have sex youll be like no thats a little bit too forward
because thats a little bit too quick in a relationship I guess I have an idea of what I want my first time to be and
and weve already weve just discussed this
and weve already
Ill tell you right now its not going to be that way
its not going to be that way
so then dont even worry about it just do it
I know but now
oh wait wait wait do it when youre ready but I mean like you know what I mean
yeah I know but
you know what I mean though dont have expectations for how its gonna be
Im kinda ready to Im just really kinda ready too
dan Dans got that offer on the table for ya
I know Dan has the offer on the table
you would make Dans millennium for that one
Im sure I would
I guess
dan would be a happy boy
I guess Im just very self conscious about my body right now cuz I think I put some weight on and so Im like I know it doesnt matter does it
you dont eat
I do eat
you cant gain weight if you dont eat
I just ate tonight
thats true but just because you ate once doesnt mean youre a healthy eater
I got you a book strong women eat well
did you read i
yes
and what did you lear
strong women eat well
and do you consider yourself a strong woma
no
but youre ok with tha
no Im trying harder to eat better
are you reall
I really am
I am
Im making sure I eat every three four hours
whats gonna happen when you go to like Cleveland and you live by yourself and you dont have anybody to be like Carolyn youre being a freak about this
because Im actually noticing in ya know like myself that ya know Im doing these things that are bad and it actually makes me happier when I eat
yes because youre not walking around all day like whats that feeling in my stomach is that hunger that kinda irritates me this is uncomfortable Im in a bad mood because Im not eating
cuz Im not hungry
because Im also letting myself eat what I enjoy more than ya know denying myself
Im willing to betchou that if you eat what makes you happy but while youre healthy and you exercise youll look better than when you starve yourself
itll be fine
I know I started to do that
I really did
and Im sure thats going to work out for ya you just have to stick to it
I know
some people
and every now and then they have this this Dilbert head in the design office that they keep filled with candy and every now and then Ill sneak in and steal like a Reeses pieces peanut butter cup ya know like one of those peanut butter cups that are like
the little ones or the ones that you can like push the middle out with your tongue and eat strangely
it depends what they have in there
cuz sometimes they like only have the little ones and sometimes they have the big ones
well I like the big ones that you can like ya know
arent those so much fun
and everybody eats a certain way
and you like put your tongue through
yeah
arent they great
thank you for the visual demonstration
youre welcome
that was cool too bad this isnt a video
there you go
I like those occasionally theyll have Kit Kats in there
I really like Kit Kats
mmmmm those are so good
I like to eat the top first and then Ill eat the bottom part
no I like to take the four Kit Kats and break them all into little ones and eat them like all on top of each other
I think like a lot of people do because then they came out with that like Kit Kat bar thing
ooooh yeah
and I it was like I dunno for some reason
it was like stacked Kit Kats
and for some reason thats the way I like to eat them
so you might as well just get the Kit Kat bar
yeah I Ive never actually had one though
neither have I
I wonder if its any good
Im sure its just as good as all the other candy is
actually I dont like Milky way n Snickers
snickers is good I dont really like Milky way
although do you know what is good Snickers ice cream bars I dont like Snickers but I like the ice cream bars
those are pretty good
those are really yummy
Im all excited about those Klondike ice cream bars
I havent had one
those were good
should we get some
well I had thought about it last time we were at the grocery store and I looked at the nutritional information
not good
and I was like woah thats bad I cant believe I ate six of those
but Brian you dont put any weight on
I do its just like not as noticeable
as when a girl puts it on
no I can do the commercial where you put the croissant on my stomach but like its not as noticeable I have such a fast metabolism
gottcha youre a lucky Ive a slow one
its all ya know just learning to accept the way your body is
I know I know
like I mean even though I have a fast metabolism like I also eat a lot and like I just dont have the body to be you know like six pack ya know like build like ya know all like Tye you know like I just dont have the genes to do that but like in my own way I like eat what Im happy and Im like physically fit so
thats true
so Ive just learned to start to deal with that

uh ha ahh I see
he knows that cabinet
yeah
It doesnt matter hes the boyfriend of one of your friends and as long as theyre attached youre kind of attached to him unless you dont want to be her friend
Well actually last time I saw her he ditched her to go play magic with his other friends
Thats
By the way are those socks that are under that chair yours by any chance As
Oh I might have left
oh My Gosh
Because theyve been there for like three weeks and I thought they were my roommates and I looked at them today and was like
I bet those are Ashs
Yes
They are my socks
How the heck did you leave your socks her
I was here really late at night
You just took them off and decided to walk home barefoo
No no no no no no no
I think you had sandals that day
I think I had sandals
Since she walked over to
And and then I walked over to James He helped you set up your computer thats so sweet
Umm no
the point was we went to New York City umm and it was okay going
like Peter and I went up and I drove my familys van
Cause theres my friend and her boyfriend who goes to which is near nyu and our third friend who goes to NYU as well so I was like well Ive got to get Kathy and Kathys like
Im not going to go without Josh cause I promised to go home with him
and then I was like
as long as im going that way ill go get Emily too
but I dont actually know where she lives so i told her to just meet us and take the subway instead of driving around more in nyc
its a heck of a place to drive
it really was
I think ive learned my lesson
Theres city driving and then theres New York and LA driving
Take Septa and NJ transit yeah
Well it was cause
Are you advising her to take the subwa
Wha make sure its light out
Oh no its not New York subway
Its um
philly transit
Its very different and perfectly safe
I dont necessarily think so
It is
I mean Ive never had a problem but
I dont know anyone else whos ever had a problem
But then again I dont think Ive ever known
anyone whose had a problem in New York city though Ive known people who have had problems in Philadelphia
Oh reall
Yeah
Wher
What kind of problem
Umm
a friend of mine got mugged
Reall
Yeah
Like on the e
Like thirtieth street statio
in thirtieth street statio
Yeah
Like on the e
It was late
I dont know actually now
It was a long time ago
It must have been on the el because
that just couldnt happen In In thirtieth street
In thirtieth streets defense shes not necessarily the kind of person who whats the best was to put it
she doesnt think hmm
is this a good ide
before she does something
Umm
and if someones going to hassle her she doesnt just go eeennnhhh theyre an asshole shes like fock you Im going to start a fight
Umm
Are you trying to insinuate your friend brought this on hersel
No Im not saying that
Im just saying she could maybe have been
more aware of her surroundings
Or
so she doesnt have the street smarts that would posslbly
Its not that she doesnt have street smarts its that she chooses not to like
Shes had fights with homeless people
So she actively chooses to
Whoa
Like she wanted to go take pictures at like Love Park or something
And she found this box to prop her camera up on and this homeless guy was like
You stole my box
And like she had a fight with this homeless guy over a cardboard box and like even if it wasnt his cardboard box just give him the damn box
Its not worth it
Maybe she thought it was
People pick odd fights on odd things
That that thats
really intense
Yeah shes an interesting person
Shes a very very intense person
I like her
Shes very cool
Wait is thi
Ma
Or is this
This is somebody else
I havent talked to her in a long time
Wow
last time I talked to her was at a party she was like
You have to come to my housewarming party
And we got there at like four in the morning
And most of the people still there were on the floor passed out
Except for that we did get to the party at four in the morning and it was their housewarming party so there was like two kegs so the people who were still there at four in the morning
yeah
Dont kno
yeah
It was interesting
And you did this in NYC over spring brea
Oh no this was a long time ago
That was in Philadelphia
No anyway the point was went to New York city
A bus tried to take the mirror of my van
There were two cops right there and they were like
yup
mmhmm Well this is NYC I think they have more important things to worry about than your
Well they were just like hanging out
They werent anything
Theyre getting ready to do something
Theyre like cats
Theyre like pounce
theyre like
You look like a drug dealer
Yeah
You know or they get a murder call and theyve got to jump in their car and sprint out they cant
be an extra twenty steps away trying to help some little old girl help
Well it wasnt bad
My car didnt get hurt so that was alright then I ran two red lights cause
They come get you the
Whoa
No actually
It wasnt till later that I had to talk to them
Umm
my friends are smarted
They
the directions they gave me to get to my friends apartment were like
Gooo till you get to Holland tunnel come outa Holland tunnel and you wanta go down this street towards Manhattan
I was like you know the name of that stree
No but then you wanna keep going to you get to like this bowl and then youll turn right and then youll go down for a little while and youll turn right again
Now Shoulda asked them for their address
Well I did
Except they didnt tell me how to spell the names of their streets
So I wasnt able to find them because Grenwich apparently doesnt have a T in New York City
Like I called them back and was like
Spell your street name for me and they did and they lied to me because they dont know where they live
I think you need new friends
They do know where they live they just
dont know where they live in relation to the rest of anything
Umm
I shouldnt have expected anything from them though
This is the person who took like threee years of knowing me and hanging out with me to be able to drive to my house without directions
Reall
Yeah
Whoa
I think this goes back to my statement that you need new friends
But thats okay you dont get to choose your friends sometimes you just kind of get stuck with them
Well there was no other way to get the computer is what it came down to
Reall
Yeah
Oh so those were the people that you were taking your computer from
Yes
So that was the entire point of
You went to NYC to get a compute
Well and it was my friends
Oh okay
Your friends
Your friends
Who do not know directions
A
She went to NYC to get a computer
Her friends just happened to be in the same place as the computer
lied to you
Fibbing will get you nowhere in this company
Its not a lie
It is a lie
I wouldnt have gone to NYC just to get a computer
No I wouldnt have
Her mouth is curling at the sides
Right there
She laughed
Its a lie
She was going there to get a computer
Her friends happened to be there
I can respect that
Okay its not like its a bad thing
She needed the computer for various projects school related and otherwise
She had to get it
It is a nice computer
No other way it was going to happen
She already discussed mailing that wasnt going to happen
No it wasnt
Anything that required my friend to make effort wasnt going to happen
Se
So it was either now or never
There nothing
dont be ashamed of the truth
How much did you pay for i
Thats not bad at all
Monitors mine
Cause she was going to give me
see that was a whole nother thing
She was going to give me the monitor but then she was like
l well my mom wants to keep this one ill get you another one from my house so we get to her house and i was like thats good thats fine your mom bought the computer originally
she can call the shots
theyre from like where I live at home it was just that she

Her boyfriend is a tumo
Jesus Christ you have to call him breast cancer next time you see him
Hey cancer how ya doin
Well it
it was originally it was originally from someone who was like
Oh my god theyre always attached at the hip
So
Im not saying its
Yeah but I dunno So everyone likes her more than him which is why
Well
people that Im friends with cause we were friends with her were never really friends with him
That thats always
a problem when you have relationships though cause you have to find someone who your friends like too cause otherwise
Well
he never tried
Like she would try and take him out well shed be like
I wanna go hang out with my friends instead of just your friends and hed be like
I wanna come too
and then hed sit there and hed sulk or be like an asshole or he wouldnt talk at all
Yeah
And if he did talk he would revolve the conversation all around himself and video games cause thats all he does
Yeah
Is this the one who was like is is this the one
Do you understan
I can empathize
I happen to have a video game problem playing problem myself and
She was like
and from time to time if I do it for too long interacting with others can be challenging
So
Wait wait
So what about like would you rather play video games or hang out with your girlfrien
Shed be like
I Assuming
This is the one
and hed be like Well then yes then
hes hes hes failing his manly duties I agree completely I yeah
Thats like thats wrong
Now I havent asked him for his point of view on this I never will
it just seems like the kind of thing
oh yeah well wed never want to know what he thought about the matter
No no God that wouldnt get us close to the truth at all
No no he no If I
asked him
Yeah
Like any kind of semi okay cultivated we pretend that its okay
Yes
would be ruined
Ah
So you would rather live in these
You think Im mea
You thought I was nice before but now youve decided Im mean
Yeah I know you too well now
I now now Ive sat here for a period of many hours enjoyed many nice conversations with you and you are obviously a very mean crass callous individual you have
no care no empathy for the world at large
Thats not true at all
Its so true
Im gonna get you a sticker or something
A sticke
Whats it gonna sa
Umm I love hating you
You know
Hating you makes me all warm inside you know something like that
Something that shows she does have love and compassion in her heart
and you beat up verbally you know
Its kind of like
When theyre not there
Exactly well thats
Or or when they are there she can squeeze them with Joy
No no she doesnt
Its its its obvious passive agressive dissociation
She sits
there and she casts aspersions on these people whenever theyre not around and whenever she sees them face to face what does she d
Hiiii hi oh
Hello
Umm
She doesnt say anything else after that and if she does theres a sharp edge to it its kind of like giving everyone a backhand every time you talk to them
I was I was complaining about these people too
Does that mean Im evil too or is she just a bad influence on m
I think your soul is still
up for grabs
I have come to save it
I have come to rescue you from this charlatan over here
who will lead you into the pits of damnation
Dont worry my dear
Just trust in me
Pits of dam nation
See thats what it is I look she gets more play than I do for crying out loud
She does
The evil racket is better
No she has a boyfriend
I was discussing this with a friend of mine
over the weekend
Girls like assholes better
Im Im giving up
wait
Of course she gets more play than you do
She has a boyfriend
Thats true
And hes many many many miles away but were
Im goin with the asshole act now and given up with the good white night act Im goin black
Reall
Ygonna wear a ninja sui
Gonna start
slappin and pimpin out women
start bein mean and ornery
I dont
like Im dating a nice guy
Hes obviously not nice then
No
I
he is he helped her set up her computer
Oh come on
Then youll scar his heart and leave him within a year
Will not
You will
Will not
Will
Youll find some mean guy you think is sexier and more exciting
Thats what it is
Its the grass is always greener than the other side
It drives the weak to
I think youre just repeating age old
I think Im bitter
I think Im horribly bitter
I think youre bitter too
I know
I think you should grow out your beard and then you would be less bitter
Wh
Then Id look like a big amish man
Well thats what my boyfriend is like and I like it
Just because you like guys with beards
are cute doesnt mean that most people do
I love
guys with beard
Do yo
Oh my gosh
See I I have an overabundance of testosterone I assume cause I grow facial hair like no mans business
And
so so you should just let it grow
Well I I cannot my father looks like Ted Kazinsky
when he first came out of that little shack in the woods I mean hes
like Blaow Grisley Adams in the house
Whoah that guy has some beard
And Id be down with that look but I think it would make me look older than I already do
look and I look kind of elderly now
I havent been carded for anything in quite some time and thats kind of cool at first but then it sucks
well you should shave
Yeah but if I shaved then I would have to shave these areas these areas are the most difficult to shave right here because they have the most curves
And I have to shave on a constant basis like every other day
if I want to look anywhere near okay every third day I can get away with
But I have to shave a lot awesome
And if I have
dont patronize me
no no no no its really interesting like
Some people dont have to shave at all some guys dont have to shave at all
Aww they they for whatever reason they can get away with shavin once a week twice a week with some of em and even if they dont go for a long time all they get is this little porn mustache like right
over their lip and around here
porn mustach
yeah its a porn mustache ever see a porn mustach
No its like a very thin little mustache
you know youre traumatizing me
stop it alright I wont
talk about porn mustaches anymore
Well my friends a stripper
thats
cool
I dont know
I was actually upset about it
reall
it was only I was upset about it because she didnt tell me
She told Peter and she told Peter not to tell me yeah
And that hurt my feelings ohhh
She told
well its probably just because shes embarressed or something
I know probably it its because she didnt want me to like be
mean to her or talk about i
But do you have a view that theres something wrong with strippin
no
I dont and thats why like my feelings are kind of hurt
because its like she thought that you had a view that you dont have yeah
and Im are you a forgive me
if are you a feminis
do you consider yourself a feminis
yes well its like it means that people could women can do whatever they want
Im not saying Im not saying that like its a choice I would make for myself
no no no no no no
but Im okay with it like I know people
but whowever makes that choice
But youre not going to cast aspersion on them
no I dont
think shes like
but there are some
there are some feminists out there that believe that that should be illegal that you should not be allowed to do that same thing with pornography
you know I see I mean I see that perspective Im not
you dont agree
with it though
I dont know
like its I think its a very
I mean its not the best choice in the world but working at McDonalds isnt the best choice in the world either and it doesnt mean
wed make it illegal
Yeah Umm I mean I know she makes good money
I know that she feels very safe
Umm like and those things are good Im glad of that yeah
Umm so I was trying to draw it into the abstract as in what you know stripping in general means to you but cause you know whenever you talk about you know my friend is doing it
well you have a lot more of a tendency towards acceptance
if your friends
doing it as opposed to some stranger somebody you dont know cause you personalize it
Honestly like I it doesnt stripping doesnt bother me I think it would be like Im now a porn star
Whats wrong with tha
like I dont know that would weird me out a little bit
wh
Ehhh I dont
Maybe its because it implies it implies
see you believe something and you dont know why
Maybe because it implies like youre youre actively doesnt porn
imply well I guess you could just be like a model or
well yeah
or something
you could do that but thats not I mean
lets talk serious porn here hard core porn
Im having sexy on television
Well not television but tv and its recorded
Yeah but I think it maybe thats just because you know we have such a generalized association with that thats just you know so
negative you know
but it
shouldnt be
its like I dont know
well if here I think what it is
if you like
the attention and
you know it makes you happy its like you know more power to you
I wanna see some
I dont know
Its that like a lot of porn is so so bad
Like in so many ways
you know
like wha
like I mean
feel free to well you know bail on this if you dont want to go into specifics but what do you find so
I like just think that it misrepresents sexuality
course it
and gender it does
Course it does
anyone who no who watches pron to get any sort of idea as to what sexuality gender and healthy relationships is I mean thats why people dont
want children to see it its because they want children to develop like maybe semi
realistic ideas of like men and women themselves the rest of the world
Thats why you cant you know get porn until youre eighteen twenty one
Or when youre eleven because you now have a family computer
Well well but that thats a problem obviously and there are ways to solve that
thats what it is and like if I knew somebody that was like I dont know that would make me uncomfortable
because of that
like if you and your boyfriend or whatever wanna go because you think little kids would see i
no
But because I just think that its I think that people in general are very irresponsible and like dont think so
I mean I would feel like I I knew somebody that was youre contributing to a problem then namely the fact that children are
no not its not about
children its about people in general like
I mean cause these are so far out there and
so screwed up umm eh the that they create
the ideas in people which are unrealistic yeah yeah
and I think that people
really do see that and think that thats normal or okay or whatever and I dont think it is and thats what would make me uncomfortable
I mean a fantasy is fantasy and thats fine
but when like I dont know
Yeah and when fantasy crosses over into reality people cant separate the two
theres something very wrong with that yes
Okay so thats the job of a psychologist
I guess the one thing that I really like about porn is encryption technology
thats arisen because of it
and that makes me happy
Yeah continue
I was going to say
that I um a have heard similar arguments
to say that you know roleplaying
is is is wrong and
and theres something icky and not acceptable about it
on those same basis because
ata point in time a
person cannot
distinguish between
reality and pretend
Im not saying
that this is anything that you can regulate
or should necessarily be regulated Im just saying that
Yeah its a problem and it is
a problem that
stretches into areas
bigger than pornography
I mean I think its a
general problem with
individuals on a
psychological level like
Ash said that is
causing the problem and if you really wanta
treat what the problem is
treat that because
because because if it isnt the pornography
if it isnt the roleplaying
theyre going to see something else
its gonna be on the tv its gonna be them walking down the street
Well Im certainly with these arguments I guess
that it would make me uncomfortable to know someone who felt that those things were okay
Yeah or would say I
make a lot of
money like that wouldnt make me well
yeah well if they uncomfortable
The other thing is though that I
I have to hope that
the people who
think its a problem
are not going to buy it and enough
people will have the general
intellect
to not support it
and not buy it
and then you wont have
problems with
people having buy
in and regulate and things like that
cause itll just disappear itll
But I mean it never will
Well thats because theres a segment of the population that wants it
and likes it and unless youre willing to accept
a paternalistic
viewpoint thats saying
I know whats best for you
I dont know I think
Im going to tell you whats best for you
its always gonna exist its gonna be
there In that case
I think the cure is worse than
the disease mainly
you know big
johnny government
telling you no no no you cant
watch that cause it I
think its bad
for you its like smoking and drinking
and drug use and all the other nonsense
I mean do think youre right I think
do think its
problem umm like my friend
whos a stripper she does she usually
works the day
Like she hardly ever works at night
Umm she has like
regular customers
Yeah
Like who at least from what
she said and that
Ive heard from
and from like reading things about the sex business
in general not just stripping
is that they just want
sombody to talk to
Yeah
and its like
What is
wrong with our society
if like youre hiring like a
prostitute or an escort
or youre going to the strip joint
because you have no one to talk to
or you have a family but you dont feel like you can talk to them
like we have a much bigger problem
than somebodys boobs
getting shaken around for money
Well yeah
and thats true and unfortunately
pornography is an outlet for a lot of
social problems and
and individual problems
that are not addressed in a more productive and creative way
its its a nasty patch job
its kind of like using you know alcohol
or any other drug to self medicate
yourself you know its not theres
problem there you need to
address and the drug use
is just something youre trying to do
to make up for it
if you want to really get at the drug use
treate whats creating the
person or causing the person
to use drugs in the first place
thatll get you a heck of a lot
better of a result
But we as a society dont care
Well like we dont
Its cheaper
Its cheapter to prevent
Its not even cheaper
its like
cheapter to prevent to to its cheaper
and easier
to deal with the symptoms than it is
with the actual problems
because if you deal with the actual problems
you would need a
level of
governmental control
that people would find
unacceptable in some
I
I dont think thats
even necessarily that I think its looking out for someone whos not you
that people in our society arent willing to do
Well but I mean I can see that if
if you want to accept that societys selfish
and kind of self centered on
me me me then yeah
I I think its
its more
apt to say that
people dont have
people you
have to be willing to say You need help
You need help you need help and whos going to be that one
person who decides who needs help
and who doesnt
Its real easy in a lot of cases
when you come to
problems like homelessness
or poverty
Yeah
obviously it needs some help
but when you get into the fundamental
issues like
you know free choice
you know privacy
when you get into those issues
its much harder
to say that I know
whats best for you
and I can
think up ways
to help you and
Im going to
kind of impose them on you
because maybe somebody
doesnt want to be helped
at what point in time does the
individual have the right to say Piss off
on you society I dont care
what you think is
best for me I want to
sit here and destroy myself
to me
I mean we I think its very obvious
that there is a line somewhere
Yeah
Maybe its not very easy to
choose but I think we can look
around at all level and all
Yeah
There are some serious problems
Every
one will accept that but no one will select accept responsibility or a solution
No one wants to pay for it and no one wants to say I think thats right
Theyd rather just dance around
Apathy
Apathy take away placate a mans pleasures
and you can take away his free will
So what do you want to do for food eat
Im starving
You didnt want cookie
My my my
if I ever wish to attract a member of the opposite sex
Jamming cookies down my gullet
is not the way to do it
Although the two fo you are lucky enough not to have this problem
As you have ensnared two young men
I still have not
So I must be
I dont know my my boyfriend has a
Little gu
Yeah
Yeah my boyfriend
says I made him fat I think thats
because he was angry
No
No no cause he has a girlfriend
Now why does hell does need to keep lookin goo
Well
Well to keep the girlfriend
Hes like I got I
Are you saying that well never leave them once we
What
Im saying that if you leave him it will most likely not be because he is fat and ugly
because my exposure to females leads me to believe
that if he is there for you emotionally
then you are willing to overlook other such problems
now let us reverse the tables
and put you in the fat chair
and him in the non fat chair
A man will go She got
Fat I need to move out I need to trade up
We are a much more physically based sex
See I
I mean I I think men are definitely more visual but I do
I could name a multiple couples that I have known
where one or the other party has put on a significant amount of weight
and the other party has not cared
No
because that is called love
and if you can look through the false facade
to the truly beautiful individual beneath that
then you can find something very important
What is that face fo
That was the most beautiful conversation
Yeah and notice how the one havin it is single
Speaking of which
Yall should put some shoes on
because I wanna take both of you out and then you
can like fight over me in public
and then I can like pick up a third woman and
leave with her
and thatll make her really hot and everything
and then you guys can get a meal out of it
Come on
Help me out here
Coo
You can have a cat fight with each other
Okay
My my
I I would so have a cat fight we can stage a cat fight
Yeah se
Definitely
If we can like stage
Thats not going to attract a woman
Yes it the one the kind Im looking for
it will cause shell be turn around and go oooh
no
fighting over that well dressed man over there
Do you
really want a girl like tha
I dont know like
I didnt say I wanted I want a meaningless sexual encounter
at this stage of the game Im not lookin for
oh okay
a home run I just wanna get to first base

Oh well whatever
setenv
set environment Cvsroot to tilde Sunya private cvs
cvs root tilde
mmm hmm
Sunya
Sunya
private
private cvs
Okay and then set then
Definitely set PgData and set
You have PgData
you should have PgData set righ
pgdata
sigh
To which on
to where ever I want it
yeah
and then
and then set environment path
this I definitely know
the pat
yeah
to the
yeah okay
thats fine okay
um x no I didnt touch anything
well the only thing that looks different is the source stuff
Uh okay
um sorry I was talking to my computer
So more importantly when are we going to go ea
who cares about wor
Yeah I know really righ
Laugh
when are we going to go eat um
augh
Im so burned out I was going to go to the librarary right
to do the check out thing
uh huh
with the books whatever
oh my god
Are you seriou
yeah
I
But I think Im making up for sleep that Ive lost over for the three days I didnt sleep
yeah definitely
which kinda still makes me really angry cause there was no point in studying
I know
That whole database thing augh I dont even want to talk about it
I like I called my mom and I was like I think I just flunked databases and my mom was just like oh
She was probably like yeah whatever Belinda Its the same thing
wait why does it say tha
c v s
Uh did you
exit out and relog in
mm hmm good point
um
yeah and then I was like
I called my daddy
Are you seriou
I
Hes always the person I call when it comes to
laugh
cs or exams or whatever
Yeah I was I dunno
that wasnt a very fair exam by any means and
The first part was fair I thought
yeah
I was like oh chugging along fine
I mean the first part could have been harder if he really wanted to you kno
But like the second part was just ridiculous
and I didnt know okay it was hard for me to guesstimate it I was taking too long compared to other people
Yeah cos like it didnt ooh I dunno
because thats why I didnt say anything right after the exam when when like Sunya was like how did you do and I was like I dunno
I figured maybe like my part that was like spending too much
no
time on the first three questions
no
and I was trying to hurry myself up through the class
Like the minute I put down my pen I was like I flunked
laugh
I flunked thats it
I When he like called like twenty something minutes I was like
Did he call twenty something minute
He did call
He didnt call five minutes at all
I was just like all of a sudden hes like okay times up and I was like wha
he didnt call anything but on the board
He just wrote stuff on the board yeah
I think when I finally looked up when he did the twenty something minutes left or whatever and I was like uh Im still working on my btree
oh
and this is only problem number three was i
yeah I got through that part pretty fast
cos I hurried through
Like I got through that I got through most of that by forty
until there were like thirty five minutes left and I was working on the rest
oh okay
So you would have had any more
It wouldnt have mattered
Heh because an extra ten minutes on the last two questions didnt matter
yeah
When he said that you know I was like oh shoot what else do I have left to do you know and then I looked at the point like like how much points were each section like on the last three questions one was
mm hmm
one was like okay a total of like six points
and then the other one was twelve points each
twelve points
yeah
okay I guess thats
i was like thats gone
thats thirty points right there
and it wasnt out of a hundred either it was out of eighty or something
Are you seriou
I dont remember if it was out of a hundred
I dunno
I dont remember
I didnt really look though
yeah I didnt either
oh gosh
thats okay
Okay I gotta
A little bit of swipe swipe action and Ill be good today
swipe swipe action
Thats so bad
Im going to have to swipe my lunch I have no cash
laugh
okay Im good I checked it out
okay
configure
dash dash prefix pound home dollar sign home
like really type tha
yeah
I guess it is
yup
because you you should have a home defined
yup
yeah
Configure not found
Okay I dont have configure
Are you in the the project three slash source durector
No
You have to switch to project three acutally
you have to be in the right directory or you cant do the dot slash dude
Yeah change into project three there yes
Yeah se
Whatever
Sunya was really good about directions actually
He is
Except for the one part where you get to gmake you have to do gmake clean first
ok
I discovered that beacause it wouldnt work otherwise
Oh I have two errors is that fin
Thats fine whatever
It always gives you errors dude
run gmake install
hmmm
wow its
Its lovely how you see ooh missing prototypes missing prototypes
Heh I dont even look at that
Missing declarations great
Do you have enough quot
I dont know well find out
Heh did you remove homework thre
oh wait you didnt set up homework three
eighty five
I have seventy seven
i have a lower grade
Arent we excite
you wha
Sorry just babbling
Repository hu
yeah
So turning on and off the thing doesnt really wor
is that what it wa
Turning on and off works no it works it just doesnt totally work
It um what we think what i think is going on is somehow you know when you do the explain select thin
Youre supposed to get um its supposed to call our unique hash and our unique has sort whatever right
mm hmm
It apparently seems like our distinct x one is working just our normal one isnt
Which is really weird because I would have thought it would have been the other way around if it was going to do it that way
I dont know if its an error cause Sunya was like it might be an error it might not be an error so were going to have to go back and look at that at some point
probably not now because probably
Okay so I guess in a sense we could go back and try to fix it but then we might be wasting time
Right
I thnk right now were wasting time so right now we need to go
better off
talking about in memory
Right so I said I will go back and look at it later like over break and you can we can today we will focus on
one is the inmemory hashing
inmemory hashing and hybrid hashing
and we should poke some files as to see maybe where where we can use what and
right
where we would implement it and where would we just yeah
right
Sigh we dont have the time to deal with this
this is retarded
I told David I was like you know its really unfair for you guys to have homework due you know basically give us only a week and he was like well
technically you guys had that week that first week because that overlap with homework homework two
two
He was like yeah homework two wasnt hard bla bla bla bla bla and i didnt even say anything
Yeah but you know wha
I was just so pissed
I was like shut up
Everyone had two weeks of midterms
yeah
It was spaced over two weeks
and like maybe I didnt have a midterm but I had papers to write
something
because remember that week when I came into Wean and we did the homework tw
I was still pretty dead because I didnt sleep and that hurt me
I pulled about four near all nighters
right
Its not a big deal beacuse whatever
yeah
but still
but he was just like you guys were supposed to work on it the first week and I was like
I was like if i didnt have an exam in a week or in a day I would argue this but
Is Kelly gon
Yeah she left already for break
She left yesterday
I dunno
I came back after that test and she was gone already so
Nice
Yeah
Heheh I want a real break
sigh senior year
laugh
Yeah the things is when I was talking because Sunya come over
uh huh
to eat ice cream remembe
and I kinda like
right right
and Ben was there and we talked
Right after class and what happened was I told Sunya I want to help out and pull my weight through
right
I felt bad about going to the interview stuff its like ill timed again
right
I think interview stuff shuld supercede school right
and instructors should kind of accomodate for that
Crystal said she got extensions on her projects with her team beacaus eshe had to be out of town
you know for a couple of days
you really think Olstons going to give us an extension
no
0
Exactly hed be like you had four weeks to do it
but yeah it ended up being like a conversation Sunya was like I dont know if Ben has a computer
he was like Ben do you have a computer and he was like yeah
what kind of connectio
fifty six k
and then Sunya was like maybe you can just work on in memory hahsing
and assume thats just your chunk and if you can get that done or mostly working then belinda and I can come back and hack in memory
the hybrid hashing
hybrid
yeah the whatever whatever
right
that didnt help but I was kinda like then later in retrospect because Ben came up to me later after Sunya came up and was like well I didnt realize you had that much work
You know how Ben is
he doesnt say anything
yeah
so like
Hes always like disappointed but like
He wouldnt even say that if it didnt bother him
right right
It must have bothered irked him enough to say something to the effect of mentioning it but not saying
he wasnt like oh you have work
right
It was just like I didnt realize you had this much work righ
so thats like very passive agressive
yeah
and i was like hmm
the other thing is yeah i did spend two hundred dollars like I was paying to go down
to go down to Austin righ
Yeah I didnt mind whatever
you know I dont shirk off work
I work hard and stuff like that you know i think that people should do like equal
Just ended up being a bad situation
yeah
and then taking to my mom later that evening cause my dad
was like you have to make sure whatever you get done you get done you have made a commitment to the group
I was like dad I should just drop the class
okay fine if it doesnt kill your gpa
I was like
but then Ill screw my members over
he was like ooh whatever dont talk to me about this
you decide you kno
heh
but then I talked to my mom since I havent seen her in a while
right
She lives out in Cali
She was the one who reminded me of the whole youre going over as a guest youve been invited
right
by his parents
Im not sure how this is but I remember when me and my Ben we had this planned oh we want to do like hotpot and we
wanted to like take him out
right
take him around and all this stuff and take him to places and restuarants and whatever
The expectation is that spring break you have no work so of course you can go out and do things you kno
yeah
and
but its just the expectation that im going to be there as a guest
right
because you like come home and my parents are pretty like youre home to spend some time so they kinda get irked if I just lock myself in a room
right
but theyre more understanding about it
right
but if came over and accepted an invitation as a guest
my mom reminded me that being a guest and she said maybe its like more of an asian thing
but she thought that
it probably is
but I
but no it makes sense
but Zack because I was talking to him about like how would you feel if someone was invited to dadi di di you know
right
and they did work
not in like constantly work but like
right but you wouldnt feel
I would borrow your computer and work and work a good chunk you know
right
yeah he was like I think that would be really rude
obviously it just especially if theyre planning thiings for you and you have to be like yeah
yeah
beacuse theyve been like kinda like oh do you want to go to the symphony they know I appreciate music
uh huh
How about this cooking clas
its all Thai and vegetarian stuff
Theyre really going out of their way to accomodate for me
right
Not accomodate accomodate but look for things I might be interested in
yeah
because Ben told them she doesnt eat meat but she eats fish or whatever
mm hmm
and his father makes like really awesome food
oh thats cool
so hes been planning dad you have to make your didiidi fish and this and make this dish and this kinda thing
aww thats awesome
so its going to be really fun but then
aww thats swwet
yeah and then I told my mom about these conversations
had with Ben and whatever
yeah
and she reminded me of that
right
its just like shoot
yeah and I wish I didnt say so quickly and make Sunya like kinda
like rely on you
Sunya will always say the right things like of course i dont want you to work and he knows
right
when hes on a road trip he cant work
right
so its not fair to expect everyone to work
right
when hes not that kinda thing whatever
but yeah I didnt want to seem like I didnt want to put in my share of work or whatever
well I think Sunya knew that youre not like
Right but I just like that conversation was like wait i kinda inadvertandtly committed without thinking stuff
mmm hmm
Like that
the conversation after class was more like to clarify that its better to expect that im not going to work on it
Right obviously
and work really hard when I come back
You and I had no expectation since we didnt have that conversation
yeah thats true
but the West Wing conversation was something like that
right
to the discussion yesterday
So as long as were all on the same page and we know were going to have to work hard or we know that its a stupid project
Oh i know gosh
Eh whatever
My schedule
Yeah what happene
gets more and more ridiculous
I dropped a class
But but I have another class after that xey block
Mmm hmm
I have another class
Oh ok I was like that doesnt make sense
You have
you have like no class at uh no class at all now huh
I have more free time than class
Mmm hmmm
Yeah I had to drop that class
Yeah I couldnt handle it
But I took on like another mini
So now I have two minis
okay I just want to say
Dianas is ridiculous
Look at on monday Her class first class ends at six now
In the mornin
At night
Ohhh
Wait ohh she on the very right
The blue one
Maybe Ill look at it again
She has she has nothing
She has like this
no see she has it better than
No I have almost
Im worse than she is
At least shes got like hour and a half blocks
Wait I have hour and a half blocks
okay dude
She starts at six oclock at night
yehneaaw
And thats her first and last class
At least shes gonna end up uhhm I uh
Im hoping shell stay with me for a five years
I hope she is
Well uhm I I looked over my curriculum
mhmm
Im going to have to be here for five years
As well
Theres no way I can
I mean
finish
Im sorry
Thats so bad
Thats so sad
Yay
Yeah Ill be here
That will be really good
Although
If you do move into like a place next year
uh huh
That means youll have to have a living I mean a room for me
Not a living room after fourth year
oh right
Yeah but anyway well figure that later
Oh kay
Thatll be good
What are you doing over the summer dud
Mmmmmm I
I want to get this internship
And Im hoping and Im praying theyll get back to me
And then dragonboat and then resume and then website
uhh
I will Im very busy
Cause fourth year like thats when you have to sort of have everything collecte
Oh shit
Not really
God In the cit
Mmyeah
What are you doin
i dont know I
You can come visit
I know I want to take classes
Im probably going to have to take a class
Mmm hmmm
I dont know if im going to do it here or not
Try to find classes in new york
Oh thats true
Where the hell am I going to do I have to find a place
Mmmm like hmmmmm
Well I have I I have a uh family in Scarsdale I could probably
Hello thats not New York City
I know
Isnt there a train thoug
Oh im sure there is
Damn that would be really cool though
Im gonna Im trying to think yeah
Who in my friends like I can contact
That would be good apartment
Cause apartments right now even though in New York City its real still expensive
Mmm hmm
Its lesser than condos
Cause everyone wants condos like everyone is investing buying selling condos
Condos
And apartments are being left behind
So
It would be really sweet cuz that what Im hoping for like when I graduate that the rates are still low
Ill like get an apartment somewhere itd be so hot
damn dude isnt housing expensive in the city thoug
It is It is
But you could always get one in Brooklyn and in Queens
And walk over
Yeah Cause uhm like Queens to New York I mean city theyre alkl like well depending on where you wanna go but about twenty five thirty minutes
Train ride
oh yeah
its really simple though because you get confused with everyone screaming at you in the subway
sorry bad bad image
Mmmmmm
its alot of fun
Yes
No its a lot of fun oh
I bet it is
And then like if you find a roomate Itll be really fun If eric wants to study
of course he wants to
theres like uhm you know the photography uhm institute there and he can take classes and we could all be together
thats true
fantastic
wow dude
Sorry Im getting all excited
Wow
Ok im gonna change
its a lot of fun
yeah sounds like it
muy bien ánimo
gracias senor
ah están los rayados hasta por el celular están enojados dice que de los
nueve refuerzos de los tigres siete van a jugar el sábado para
que tomemos en cuenta
Raul Lopez Castillo que si va a jugar Claudio Núñe
No va a jugar Claudio Núñez
José Alfredo Villanueva Reyes dice que nosotros los tigres no estamos preocupados que los que se preocupan son los rayados ya que están pendientes de quién se va y quién viene
Christian de la colonia del valle que necesita hablar con don Roberto al aire que por favor se comunique con él ya que ayer también le pidio que le hablara y no le habló le hablo en este momento
con mucho gusto espero que esté desocupado el teléfono
para poder tener el honor de platicar con él
si es de la colonia del valle evidentemente es rayado
bueno buen
que tal don Roberto
quién habl
Christian
hola Christian
que tal
a las órdenes
aver tu dices que los tigres estan incompleto
yo no digo
lo están
es cuestión nadamente de palomear
ok yo te voy a decir una cosa
para empezar ellos van a salir con once jugadores
ayer tu lo dijiste son once contra once es uno contra uno que el bongo bongo no es lo mismo que el otro chavo de barcel
entonces eso es cierto
pero yo te voy a decir una cosa
los tigres no son siete u ocho jugadores
los tigres son un plantel de veinticinco
y cuando yo veo una foto del plantel de tigres
yo no veo miembros de tigres A miembros de tigres B
miembros de tigres C
Tigres son veinticinco jugadores
jueguen los que jueguen
a menos de que tengas que subir gente de divisiones inferiores
son lo mismo
mientras tu pongas esos once estan completos
si tu tienes once para jugar en la cancha y siete para banca tigres va a estar completo
cuando usted en el caso del equipo de Monterrey
mueve solamente uno caso por ejemplo y no le voy a decir el centro delantero Denigris porque sería mucha ventaja de mi parte
cuando usted mueve al lateral izquierdo
mete a Chabrand y quita al otro jugador cambia todo eh
es cierto que cambia todo
nadamas con uno
con uno que yo mueva
osea
pero le debo decir sabe que que por eso debe de el Monterrey o el tigres o el equipo que sea
tener gente para suplir deben entrenar para esas situaciones
yo estoy de acuerdo
tigres sabe que si sus seleccionados no se bueno se van deben de tener entrenada gente para suplirlo
yo estoy de acuerdo
que si te expulsaron al portero pues que debes de tener otro
estoy de acuerdo
que si esta lesionado el diablo entonces que le iba a decir
nadamas que
son once contra once
una cosa es sustituir
a uno y otra cosa es sustituir siete
si usted va a sustituir un defensa central y sigue usted contando con Claudio Suárez
no hay ningún problema
pero si se le va Claudio Suárez y se le va Hurtado
y tiene usted que meter dos novatos ahi ya pesa
le voy a decir una vea usted al Guadalajara le quitan al pirata y le quitan a Claudio y ve usted al mismo jugador que se veía muy bien ahora andar completamente mal
entonces el Guadalajara tiene la obligación de contratar a alguien que lo pueda suplir
claro
y si no lo hace ese ya es problema del Guadalajara
claro
va a pagar el respectivo precio que es como lo esta pagando ahorita
si tigres no tiene calidad para sustituir un centro delantero con otro centro delantero del mismo nivel no de la misma caracteristica porque no es igual
evidentemente va a pagar un precio
yo veo desde ahorita que el tigres esta expuesto a pagar el precio en el clásico
no se enojen por ello
asi es pero sabe que no no le quite desde ahorita mérito a un posible triunfo del Monterrey
no le estoy quitando mérito estoy diciendo simplemente eso vamos a suponer
ah como les digo ya Chihuahua
es que ustedes se enojan luego luego
piensan que yo estoy demeritando un probable triunfo de Monterrey no es así
entonces no saque tantas tantos pretextos
no es pretexto
son pretextos son pretextos
es simplemente una una objetividad en cuanto a ver al equipo de tigres casi casi le diria a usted que no es
usted puede contar que el equipo de tigres tenga la misma proyección ofensiva
no quiero mencionar nombres porque voy a herir ahi a algunos jugadores
de alguna manera
Tuca Ferreti lo sabe
si
y evidentemente ahorita en este momento esta con mil problemas para armar el partido del del proximo sábado
si
que no es un partido común y corriente usted sabe lo que se pierde cuando se pierde un clásico
si si si
pero si usted me dice a mí cuál esta más cerca de ganar pues está
está más cerca Monterrey toda la vida eso no quiere demeritarlo
pero aun así todo lo que se está diciendo de que están debiluchos que no hay central
bueno
sera cierto pero
como quiera sigue siendo tigres y ganarle a ese equipo o ganarle al otro va a ser a final de cuentas lo mismo
ayer le hice una pregunta al público y nadie me la contestó le pido a usted que me la conteste si al Monterrey le quitamos a Denigris qué pas
qué pas
el Monterrey a lo mejor se debilitaría pero sigue siendo el Monterrey son circunstancias que pasan en el futbol
pero evidentemente no va a encontrar la misma cantidad de goles o la misma facilidad para meter el gol
a lo mejor
mire usted
pero Monterrey debe
mire usted la cantidad de goles cuantos lleva Denigris y cuantos lleva el resto del plantel y como dice Benito Floro
Monterrey debe estar preparado para que le quiten a Denigris
como dice Benito Floro en el periódico el día de ayer en el diario de Monterrey dice nosotros dependemos de Denigris nuestra ofensiva está clavada en Denigris
asi es
entonces eso es un problema del Monterrey
claro
no debemos de depender así
tigres tiene un problema al estar dependiendo
lo que pasa es
es que para que encuentres a otro Denigris esta cañón tienes
que jugar con él un día se te va a lesionar bueno pues ya veremos como como se hace pero evidentemente prepárense porque ese día el Toluca sin cardozo el partido pasado fue otro cu otro Toluca
la delantera no funcionó
si
porque hay jugadores claves en posiciones claves no son once contra once como ustedes dicen eh
si asi es que le iba a decir son al decir que son once contra once quiere decir que estan completos en cuanto a números
ya si los si los equipos no tienen gente para suplir a sus a sus importantes entonces sabes que ahí es un problema
claro
uno debe de tener cuando menos uno
o cuando menos dos y si no los tiene uno debe de preveer bueno que va a pasar cuando me falte este jugador
debo de entrenarlo para que el que venga
claro
y que está atrás aunque no tenga la misma calidad clave en ese sistema
usted me puso el ejemplo del Toluca
el Toluca quitas uno quitas otro y no varia mucho
el Toluca esta listo para jugar con quien sea y como sea
y si tigres no esta listo tigres o Monterrey o el Guadalajara o el que sea no esta listo para cuando se les van jugadores así
o se lastima uno o le suspenden uno para jugar de otra manera sabes que eso es un problema de tigres
así como es un problema cuando a los que salen titulares que son titulares
le voy a poner
le voy a poner a usted otro ejemplo de ver lo lo lo lo lo confuso que es el deporte del futbol lo diferente lo difícil que es el deporte del futbol
cuando el Monterrey tuvo aquel equipo de Ledezma de Guarací Cano este el halcón Ricardo Díaz Juan González todo eso
si usted ve la alineación y se la platican
hay una estrella en cada posición y el suplente es igualmente una estrella
si le faltaba Corbo entraba Damián si le faltaba Jiménez entraba Milton o
viceversa si faltaba Nilo entraba Avilán el gorras Guerrero puro
jugador estelar
si
y que pas
se hicieron bolas a la hora de la hora empezaron los eh los los golpes por abajo que
yo quiero jugar que yo no quiero banca tan problema es que tengas demasiado estelar como problema es que no tengas sustitutos para ser estelar
lo que yo le cuento a ustedes es que tigres no tiene el total de los sustitutos como para adaptarlo en en cuatro o cinco días de entrenamiento
entonces deben de adaptarlos desde antes porqué hasta ahorit
ah porque hasta ahorita surge el problema
pos ese es problema de tigres que se pongan a preveer las situaciones que se puedan dar
claro que es problema de tigres
si
evidentemente yo no digo que el Monterrey tenga nada que ver ustedes son los que dicen que yo estoy demeritando algo que puede pasar
a lo mejor no lo está haciendo pero esta poniendo énfasis en ese punto
o a lo mejor se fijan ustedes demasiado
no pero lo está haciendo es lo único de lo que hemos hablado toda la semana practicamente
es que es la noticia más importante
no la noticia más importante es el clásico no que si tigres trae
ya esta
ese ya esta el clásico va a jugar el lleno ya esta asegurado
si
la gente ya esta adentro que falt
pues analizar a los planteles
y los planteles me dicen a mí por lo menos a mí que tienen ese ese ese problema
le parece bie
pues nadamas espero que si llega a ganar Monterrey que no le quite méritos y que si llega a ganar tigres no diga que mira que con plantelito chiquito tigres es tigres jueguen los que jueguen
hecho señor
igual el Monterrey igual el Guadalajara
le agradezco Christian
muchas gracias
orale
está enojado está enojado están enojados
todo mundo está enojado
oye parece ser que levantamos algo que arde en serio

Essentially the other conversation we had was about was about the tendency of people speaking English certain groups speaking English to combine all sorts of random roots into new words which most people then couldnt understand
Oh wow

Thats splendiferous
Thats a real word though
Nah real word fake word English is weird
And fun
Glad it was a first language

vampires and carriage races
glass breaking and
Yeah but lets see there was one last night
I think it involved like western mysticism
Um but I dont remember much about it
What do you count as western mysticis
Um you know western esoteric tradition Kabbalah Golden Dawn and all that stuff
I dont remember much except I woke up and was like thats kinda funny that was an odd dream and then I dont remeber it
I keep meaning on writing my dreams down but then I forget
Or Im just lazy
Your dreams or do you forget to write them dow
I forget to write them down
I generally remember them for at least a few hours or more
At least recently
A few months ago I didnt remember them at all so thats kinda strange
You had trouble learning how to walk when you were younge
I had trouble learning how to skip
I dont think I had trouble learning how to walk
Oh I dont know how to skip properly
I thought you did
No I only know the wizard of Oz skip
Whats the differnec
Umm
You go two feet and then switch two feet
reall
yeah
Ive never noticed that
Is that what they do in the movie or is that just what its calle
yeah
Thats what they do in the movie
And apparently I watched the movie too often when I was learning how to skip
People used to make fun of it
I think I learned how to skip in like third grade
It was
It was quite embarrassing
Thats ok
You should try attempting to learn how to skip in highschool
But you cant skip now or can yo
I can still do the wizard of Oz skip
Can you skip normall
Ummm
no
Do you want t
Learn how to skip normall
I dont really care theres not much use for it that Ive found
Ok
Thats fine
I suppose
Hmm
So hows MatSci goin
Good
Umm We learn about materials and the science and engineering around it
Isnt that interestin
Just like the titl
Im probably taking intro to
Were doing the ring casting lab soon
Yeah you told me that
Thats really cool
I hope so
What is it bronze from the bronze you had befor
Was that bronze or was it
Ehhh brass I think bronze something like that
Brass is the shiny one and bronze is the hard one I think
It was a long time ago at least a month and a half
Oh but so youre not casting it from the same stuf
No were casting it out of silver
I dont know if were actually going to alloy the silver ourselves maybe I should find out
It might be a good idea before I actually go to lab
Yeah so how does one do this or how does one do thi
Castin
I mean do you is there a ring mold that you
Ah yeah theres many different ways to cast things
I dont know how were doing it
I think were using a hard mold
I dont know that that means
Yeah well theres also casting with like stuff like green sand and
oh ok
Yeah um are you o
Yeah Im fine
Ok
Do I not look o
No you look vaguely vaguely whats the word sultr
Sultr
Oh yeah
Right ok
I was dizzy earlier
Thats kinda like sultry only not
Yeah yeah same motion of the eyes I suppose
Are you sleep
Im very sleepy
Are you hungr
Im not that hungry I ate earlier
Well thats good
Thats why I ate
because I was dizzy
And then I became less dizzy but it took me a while
So Im uh hoping I dont have mono like uh everybody else
Except for Ed
Yeah
Even though his girlfriend has mono he has no mono
Um
Lets talk about star constellations
Do you know anything about star constellation
I can recognize some I
Let me guess Orions bel
I can recognize Orion and lets see Orion and Taurus and Cassiopeia and theres somthing over here which sometimes I know
But I dont remember what it is
Its generally the stuff that is overhead in my town hometown during the summer
I see
Im not good at recognizing star constellations
But I am good at using telescopes
Are yo
mhm
Which has nothing to do with star constellations
No no it really doesnt
mm mm But most people are better at that than telescopes
Um well how much skill is there involved in using a telescop
Is ther
I dont know
Its been a while
Depends on the telescope
Yeah thats true
I know how to use several different kinds
I dont know I never really got in a fight until I mean after I was twelve
I was a bit of a I was the enforcer in uh first grade actually
Um and we had this little band you know there was like a clique and
A band like Journe
A Journey cover ban
Yeah
You were in a Journey cover band when you were in first
Yeah I was the drummer
no
Um yeah for some reason there like there were like four out of us that were you know
Like Will S om R and I and Greg H
and for some reason I was the muscle
And occassionally I
Youre so scrawny
You wouldnt seem to me to be the most effective
Yeah I know I know
Because I was vicious
And I beat the hell out of Danny H
who had a head that was like a beach ball
It was huge
I feel bad for people with really big heads
Yeah
We knew this guy named Mark
Um big head Mark who was in a really awful band
And uh his head was easily three sizes too big for his body
And he had and on top of that he had this big curly hair
And like if youve got a big head already dont get big hair on top of it
Yeah
Makes it look even bigger
It was really amazing
But like every time after that like when uh an occasion arose to be in a fight one of two things were gonna happen
I was gonna lose in which case I ran and I was pretty fast
Or two I was gonna clearly win and the other person backed down
Thats a good way to fight
Yeah that was what my dad taught me early it was like you know never fight a fair fight
In a fair fight half the time youre gonna lose
Or youre youre youre gonna take at least as much damage as the other person
Yeah so like um one time they had I the the kids up the street wanted to get in a fight wanted to kick my ass
So we knew it we knew they were like plotting to like catch me when I was out riding my bicycle righ
So
This isnt a Simpsons episode
No actually uh this was Tom R and all this stuff
It was really cool cause I got um uh ah shit what was his last name
Nelson Munt
No
His brother was like the biggest dickhead on the planet and I hated him
But like his older brother was kinda cooler and would occasionally give his younger brother a beatdown when he was being too much of a dickhead
Um anyway for some reason he sympathized with my cause right
And he was like eighteen and he rode a BMX bike and all this shit you know like he was like a lose
And we didnt realize it because we were little righ
And um so anyway he uh
Because you have to be a loser to be eighteen and actually give a shit about anything in a twelve year olds life
Exactly exactly
I mean thats clearly how much of a loser he was
He he came to like my defense righ
So um the idea was I rode like right through the hood you know like where you know they were waiting
And and that they came running out after me and then all my friends were just kinda like magically appeared around me like
hey whats goin o
You know like were ready to rumble righ
Of course Pats there whos like eighteen or whatever and you know theyre theyre all like
uh hey Pat because you know theyre all friends all of a sudden
And the fight didnt happen cause we had overwhelming numbers
Thats typically how it worked out
Either that or I had like a piece of lead on a string or something
That was one of my better we would kick
A piece of lea
Did you give people lead poisonin
Yeah youre in thirty years man youre gonna have developmental problems
No
Im gonna rub this lead on you
We had a I I had about uh three inch cubes cube of uh lead
And I drilled a hole through it and put a rope through it and then I had a tennis racquet that I had smashed earlier that
In a fit of rage
I cut the cut the head off the tennis racquet just drilled a hole in the like tennis racquet handle and tied the rope to it so it was essentially like a homemade flail and er mace I guess well yeah flail
Whomping stick
It swings around
Yeah cause uh Darren nearly got accosted by these um uh two jokers from somewhere uh a different school or something like that
So we were all on the we were gonna go administer a beatdown right
And I dont know what the fuck I was gonna do other than kill someone
Yeah thats not something you cant really be half assed with that
Its like theres like you either dont use it or you you might as well just kill the other person
Yeah
Because youre gonna do so much damage
Yeah
Um fortunately they were never found so I never really got a chance
Or maybe they were just never found and you shouldnt be talking about this any more
Yeah
That was the one time that Pats younger brother Brian G
thats what it is G
Fucking dick
Um he chased uh Tom and I um to Toms hous
But we were just uh there a little bit ahead of him
Went into the garage and pulled out like these pipe wrenches that were like were literally nearly as big as we were
And we were waitin for him outside but when he came around the side of the garage
And all of a sudden hes like
Hey hey guys whats going o
He chased us like for three blocks
And then struck up a conversation
Because we had big fucking pipe wrenches
You were just evil
Well I mean we never really
You know its display of force more than it was like actual use thereof
Girls fight in different ways
psychologists love this
Like they go they tear out they tear they go for the they fight nastier when they actually get into it
Like you dont wanna get like
Like baby oil
But well no
But like guys guys will just try to beat on each other but girls will tear out giant clumps of hair
No I meant like relational aggression
And go for like constant maximum Oh
Sure
No Im just talking about chickfights
Chickfights like like ask ask any
Girls dont have physical fights anywhere near as much as guys
But if you ask a bouncer bouncers know you can you can break up two guys who are fighting
They fight over a man
But well when you get well you can step like if two guys are fighting you can step between them and break them up
But if two girls are fighting you have to let them go cause theyll scratch
It depends on the age
The last time I saw a girl fight I think they were like twelve or something like that in which case its just like two effeminate boys fighting its a slap fight
There was like I remember like it was really funny we engineered this whole thing that for some reason there was this one dude in our school that we hated more than anyone else
Like uh Danny S
And he uh he actually dropped we kicked his ass so much he left our school
Actually he came to our school cause he was getting his ass kicked at public school
So we kicked his ass and he went to he went to Kiski
Where where like all the troubled kids go
Like it was like the the private school
And he got his ass kicked there
Whats wrong with this kid that made him get his ass kicke
He was just like
was he an asshole o
Oh he was such a huge asshole
Why didnt somebody just tell him if youre less of an asshole people wont wanna kick your ass
I you know reasoning with him really wasnt like I mean he was just clearly developmentally wrong
You mean he coulda been a special ed ki
Uh I mean he was you know the scab picking nose picking in the middle of class
Like just just I mean just repugnant
Like you just didnt want to be near him
Then he was a dick on top of it righ
And just not very bright either so you know it all kind of worked against him
He was basically hes the ape that the society would have just rejected
He was one of like those like
He would have starved to death
He was the one of the weird loner apes that would have been out in the forest
that that
Flashing himself to other apes
Yeah
Uh well well for instance we were comin home one day and of course Im playing my normal antagonist role
Right and I never really physically fought that often
But I was a real dick when it came to like making fun of people
So Im making fun of him and just basically circling him on my bicycle
I was just calling him all kinds of shit righ
Finally he gets pissed off and swings his bookbag and clips my friend in the face who happens to be like the biggest fucking kid in eighth grade
Like shaved in eighth grade
Oh my god
Actually
He shaved in sixth grade he was still shaving in eighth grade
But like it was daily at that point
Was he was he
Was he like had he been left back two grades or somethin
No no he just and whats funny is now hes like small
Hes a Hes a he never got any
He was five eight in eighth grade he is five eight to this day
Like he just grew like I dont know
He bloomed and thats it
Yeah yeah he races stock cars
Does that pay wel
Hu
No
Um lemme think his son should now be
Youre youre
should should now be
If you say anything over ten
thats thats bad
Fifteen
Oh aww aww
Fourteen fourteen maybe
Thats not good
Yeah
See you shouldnt be a daddy when youre fourteen
Well man he was sixteen I think when he
Oh well thats different thats really mature
Yeah
Yeah you have a lot of experience
And his girlfriend
was older than him she was like twenty three or twenty four
So thats then she was a child molester
That is so wrong
Oh he was great hed get like a case of beer for him and his girlfriend
And his girlfriend would have like two beers and hed drink the whole case
When he was seventeen like
Cause I think she bought the beer for him
Sounds like a relationship made in Heaven
okay
right so paper um
paper yes
we have to get this paper in by yesterday
im sure we can tell jason what to do about that
yes i dont think thats a problem
anyway so whats the current status you were going to send me a draft on tuesday
i pointed you at a tex file on tuesday
okay so youre supposed to remind me that i was supposed to read that file on tuesday
i did
when i met with you on tuesday
oh yeah
okay so i havent read that yet
um
well good because ive been adding to it all day today
good
so you didnt notice how little had been done yesterday for example
uh thats true
um well done
uh ive got a little over a page most of the describing the method we did
okay
how we built a voice in noise um and then a little bit about how we generated the random sentences and a few examples
okay that sounds good
so theres actually a p d f file
want to briefly show it to me
yes if i can manage to get it to load
it could probably use a little bit of editing but i have been going over it a few times
uh its gonna need more content as well
oh obviously yes
okay um du du du du i want you to okay so ill pick that up this evening
and have a pass and add stuff
so the things im going to add is uh why were doing this in the first place
though you maybe covered that already
uh no i really didnt cover that too much although it could probably get covered in the sections that ive done
the introduction is probably a better place
the introduction is probably a good place to do that
on tuesday you did say you would do that
yes i know i do i do remember saying that i would uh do that
um uh
id like a breakdown of number of sentences number of phones number of diphones number of triphones in it
uh theres a similar breakdown in the arctic tech report
but its not going to be exactly the same because we didnt use all of the arctic
and didnt even use all of one set of the arctic
thats fine but there still is a set of phones set of diphones to have for that particular set
and uh number of units things like that
um probably a description of the automatic build process that we do
um uh as with the um so were trying to come up with a name for the one that jason and uh arthur did
and so things like artick were coming in because uh Arthurs a r t thats his initials but we realized that we have arktick artick and the articulatory database that we intend to do especially if its based on the arktick uh um dataset with Art speaking it and its articulatory it would get confusing so we decided to use another name
so uh presuming its aesops fables and cia world factbook
uh and so thats uh facts and stories or facts and fables facts and fiction um
and we identify which ones are facts and which ones are fiction um
and a whole bunch of interesting things I wont say because im being recorded
youre not supposed to mention that youre not supposed to remember that youre being recorded
this is supposed to be a natural conversation
i dont
i dont because im recorded all the time um
well actually
then you probably are
yeah i think i am
uh you go to the ISL youre probably recorded all the time at least they reserve that right
um right anyway so we need to have a name for this that were going to release and the u r l and we did decide on the nam
did we decide on the name or did i decide on the nam
i think you decided on the name and didnt mention it to me
okay um so the name i was working with was swan
yeah thats what i was
what we were using i think thats okay
a catchier name might be better
yeah
but im not good at that
same here so lets just
use swan
right okay so we have that were gonna have a u r l so its gonna be festvox dot org slash CMU underscore swan
itll be pointed off the lets go page but thats where its going to be
right
thats the best place to put it
um
and theres a bunch of analysis that has to be done sort of the things that we did with the duration modeling and its overall look inside the tables for that
i think i have the data for that
tables will take up space thats good
yeah exactly
i mean wait no thats not what im supposed to say
ah i see that youre learning what it is to be a graduate student
thats very important
i have a nice figure thats just a couple sentences that takes up a lot more space than the sentences themselves would if i just put em inline
yes that works too
but it sets it off so nicely it fits in perfectly
so its an example sentence from the databas
three example sentences not from the database but from the semantically unpredictable set
i see
thats the right thing to do
a few drunken bagpipes built the sneaky ideas
yeah the speech recognizers never gonna get that
um good
i think thats fine uh the only problem is i really like to get this so were going to actually start the review process on sunday
um so id like to have a paper by sunday
that would be good
for my own sake id like to be well done with this by sunday regardless
no i agree
i have other things to do
thats the problem with having deadline extensions its like they go into the next deadline
exactly
and i really cant afford to do that
so i am hoping to write more this evening although i have have to write other papers and a talk and
the writing im less concerned about its the content that im very concerned about cause we havent done the listening tests yet
so i have to set up the listening tests
okay good
that i think is the largest worry is the the overwhelming priority because if we dont have that as much as i can make stuff up i dont think that would be a good thing to put into a paper
um yeah youre not senior enough to do that
ah so well just put you as the first author then
im not old enough to do that i havent retired yet
um uh yeah
um yeah so as long as those listening tests get done tomorrow im not im not too concerned
especially if they get done early enough tomorrow
um then i can then i can get most of the paper written friday
the problem is that all of our wonderful students dont come in at eight AM
so im assuming i am not participating in the listening
absolutely not
cause i know too much
you absolutely cant
you probably can
i think i can
well know which one it is and if im weirdly biased then we will exclude me
also i think being a non native isnt an issue
probably not its general understandability so even if its if its less understandable theres the problem of youre listening to your own synthesizer so
i think thats that i mean im more tainted from that but all of us have listened to too many synthesizers so thats
and specifically too much festival
yes exactly
um uh well try everybody else and see what they get
there will be issues in how to measure the result were gonna ask them to write down what they heard were gonna have to measure word correct um
hmm right next is the lets go stuff
im still poking around with that its not ready yet
but that granted that the paper will be done or that i wont have anything to do with the paper in the intervening time i should be able to get that done by monday morning at the absolute latest also
im look im trying to get that done saturday
the absolute latest is saturday
thats fine thats fine i dont think thats gonna be buckets of work i think thats just gonna be some bit of work
yeah basically i need to really delve in ive only scratched the surface of what i needed to do ive been poking around in those directories trying to find what the structure is if there is any
its not been encouraging so far lets say
so im im kinda hoping that i find i find out that there is actually an underlying pattern to logic to how we do how were storing it right now such that i can just take whats there rearrange it very slightly or better yet automatically and go pfft heres a big big bunch of files zip it up and say pffft there ya go
zip and tar g z
um so actually what i do i think the other ones i do zip and tar b z
because im assuming that the tar people will have b z two
um and the other people wont know what it is any wont know what g z is anyway so it doesnt really matter
winzip knows g z
yeah well thats true
and it knows tar
yeah it knows tar but it trashes all the files
well yes
it puts uh control ms into
sometimes
okay only when theyre not needed
um i told you about theres a thing in festival with a line in the code that says if youre debugging and get here cause cause the database keeps falling over the answer is the database was unpacked with winzip with smart CRLF transitions
cause weve weve been in there too often
Just in case something
Just in case theres any wondering hu
Two to you
Im out
Out
Alright
I raise
Raise to four oh now hes gonna get aggressive just to
Uh oh
So you owe two
Im out

Did anyone fol
No no but did you go i
To two mor
I raised so she called two so you need to call two more
You guys everyone not in yeah I need you to call two more
And you need to call two more
Hsien youre ou

Shes not gonna let you get her money
I know
Um youre still dealing though
Yes did we are we all i
Okay
Oh nice I wish Id stayed

Pair of tens and an ace
Im out
Youre ou
Four
Thats a five Joanne
Its okay
Its okay here do you want this one bac
Thank you
Okay
Get it while Im there
Yeah
Last card flop
Down
Three
Didnt help
Once again the three does nothing
So whatever you had on the last four cards is what you got unless
Unless you have the four five in that case youre good
Right
So it goes to you
Ill bet
Four more
Im out
Mauree
Who else is in anybod
Uh Lyn and Joanne
There are a lot of people in
Four people total
Four to sta
Yep
Lets see was I betting oka
Just look at the order
Three of a kind is like three hearts righ
No like three tens
No like three threes
Oh thats it
Okay
Because three hearts doesnt do anything
Three hearts is very easy to get
I check four in for four
Alright Ive already lost then
ka
I have aces
I have aces
As a matter of fact I exactly match it
Ooh man
This your
And she has three
And I have three tens but you have the higher card
It does it does it does play it does play
It doesnt matter on this
Yeah cause of the ace nine ace eight
So she wins
Winner
Wait wait wait
wait
Wait explain this again
But the other time I could say we both had ace that ace
You have to build a five card hand
But you have to have a fifth card
So thats my fifth card
Ten ten ten ace nine to ten ten ten ace eight
If there was a king on the table then you split
Man thats close thats a heartbreak
That ones a heartbreak
But I do feel better knowing that Nick stayed in with exactly the same hand so I didnt make any worse judgement than Nick did
I shouldnt have
Alright I need your cards Ekta I need everybodys cards
Wha
There was a blue on
I made change
All right then thats okay
Okay I think those have been yes
Yeah those are shuffled if I remember well

for breakfast
they all sat around the table right
and they watched me eat breakfast
All staring at me

it was
the stew literally this big righ
And they made like dinner for like twenty in that
in that stew pot righ
So they served me the first bowl

I just inhaled
I just inhaled it
In like
like a minute
I ate the whole thing righ
They thought I loved it so much they poured me more and I was like

after I said I want fourths that was like pushing the limit cuz
I only said it because uhhh I just wanted to be polite

Tenth bowl came around and

And then I was like ohh
uhh
whatever and Ill just like turn around and just pretend like who cares righ
And then I look back
its just four black people
Half
Twice my height righ
Four of them righ
And like theres no one around righ
And Im like oh sh
oh shoot Im in the ghetto righ
So Im like alright
okay
This is what I can do I
I just zoned out from Louise and Im like
Im thinking to myself I could still talk to Louise
And then uhh
I could just
slowly hang up
put it in my pocket and just
just start running righ
Or
but
I was afraid that that might trigger a spark because you know black people just love to
Ha Ha so racist
I know
You know when theres some sort of action
Okay any
any kind of aggressive people
Yea
Eh
aggressive looking people
Like
if they see someone running thats like gonna trigger them to start running after you righ
Or they could just make you
that could
that could just make them pissed at you because they think that your being racist just cuz theyre black youre running away
And then theyll chase you
Yeah
And they love action cuz when one black person runs all of em start running
But then yo
check
check this out righ
And Im like uhhh
I dont wanna do that
because uh
you know
thats gonna
I dunno its just I
I just choose to just act casual righ
Cuz I thought maybe if I just act casual who cares just minding my own business doing my own thing righ
Theyre just gonna walk past me righ
And I just
tried to play it off
So I did that
and then uhh
And then I turned around Im like Louise
uhh
theres
I dunno what to do theres four guys approaching me right now
So I turn around righ
And they just walk past m
One of them just grabs my collar righ
And I just
I just uhh
fall straight dow
And then uhh
I get back up righ
And then three of them just jump m
And they push me down I dont understand it takes
they all
they all came and jumped me and I was just like half their height righ
So they pick me back up and theyre
theyre like what the hell are you doin
what the hell are you doin
swearing and shit righ
and this this one black dood just takes a big blunt hit and blows it right in my face righ
And then Im like right then and there righ
Something went right under my ribs
Yea
And I was like oh oh shoot righ
And I just froze righ
And then dood like I was so pussy righ
Like at that moment I bet everyone would act like this too righ
So he ordered sheets of money from the Treasurer ok and you you theyre not theyre uncut
Right
So he gets these sheets in the mail and he sets out in front of the cashier and cuts them out
He cuts them out and hands them to the cashie
You didnt get those from the Treasury did yo
and he says yep yeah
You can do tha
Yeah he got a sheet of twos and a sheet of fives
Dude
Thats awesome
They cost him more though
yeah
like a sheet of fives is thirty two fives and so it should only run only about a hundred and fifty dollars dollars but it runs about a hundred and eighty
Oh that makes sense though but its still cool
No its not cool
I dont know why you pay more to like do their work for them
So I think its because they have to keep track which bills theyve like sold uncut
So that if somebody calls them and is like
Well we arrested this guy for counterfitting money
did you actually sell this to hi
and they have to like be able to keep track of the serial numbers or whatever
okay
Oh let me see
whats in ther
what do you cook with Heinz ketchu
Everything
we have like Cho
They should have a Theresa Heinz cookbook
So i actually brought that the recipe for chocolate cake is bad
Ketchup in i
Yeah
but uh its its a cookbook using Theresa Heinz as the ingredient
Wait you have to share
you have to share
Brownies with Hein
You put
You put ketchup in brownie
and chocolate cak
Oh its called SurpriseChocolateCake
That funny because you bite into it
And youre like ahaha surprise
I put ketchup in the chocolate cake
Wow theres
You can make cookies
and spice cake
They have ketchup in the ingredients
but then they never use it
I hope
Oh God
Well a quarter cup Heinz Tomato ketchup
No they actually do it
One sift sift together flour soda and salt
You know for my conversation i wanna have a theological debate
That would be great
I was thinking of recording my uh my Philosophy my Philosophy of Language class but that would be annoying
So I just added Tepper to my list of interests
Look number three
Add ketchup and egg
Mix well
Something transcend
a play
you would prefer tha
So Akiva and I want to memorize that or
That or Waiting for Godot
for the desk attendants in Mudge
cus theyre always in there
theyre always just sitting there
we always walk in together
Because youre lover
No cus were roommates
oh
Zucchini Lasagna
Lover
Im just really
I think Im really afraid of anything that has
anything thats a desert that has ketchup in it
Im afraid of anything with ketchup in it
Thats true
Im afraid of that also
Itll kill you
Actually my mom used to make lampchops with
with ketchup
and it didnt taste bad at all
But look you can make cookies
and
Surprise Chocolate Cake
You bite into it and youre like ahh
Its full of ketchup
Its so disgusting
Surprise Chocolate Cake is ketchup
Surprise
The surprise
Surprise
That the surprise
its made of ketchup
Surprise Im made ketchup
Turkey Chili
Porkchops
But like I can understand chili and porkchops with ketchup
Right Right
0
But brownie
But cake and
and cookies
My neighbor actually makes a really good zucchini chocolate cake
ew I dont think I really like zucchini in chocolate cake
Ive made zucchini chocolate cake chocolate chips
So like
How does that wor
does it taste like zucchini at al
No you kind of like grind up the zucchini as much as possible in like
the food processor
and and its just better for you than real chocolate cake I guess
Theres like little flecks of like green skin in it too
you look at it and youre like ew
Thats why you peel the zucchini before you before you use it
Does it uh have milk in i
Ok I could understand minestrone
Lets see ketchup in ummm
Oh God adding ketchup would be so
Thats mustard
mustard is good
Mustard is inherently ennobling
No because mixing ah ketchup and mustard both in chocolate cake does not make better chocolate cake
Oh God
Mustard Ketchup Chocolate Cake
No no it doesnt
but we should make the chocolate cake but replace all the ketchup with mustard and see how it tastes
Idiots
I dont think that was
Mustard is inherently good and ennobling
Use honey mustard and maybe not just regular not regular mustard
Use spicy mustard in the chinese restaurant
Mustard has mustard in it oka
Oh god
Hu
Spicy Mustar
You dont want spicy mustard in your chocolate cak
Id like to make like a really rich chocolate cake with like made with lots of capsaicin
Oh no
Oh God
That would be so wonderful
I wonder if you could put wasabe in the cake
Oh God
okay wasabe is amazing in wash mashed potatoes
So I always like roasted garlic with my mashed potatoes
Like Id like to make a chocolate mousse except with capsaicin
Like if I ate it Id be like Chocolate
oh my God t burns
That would be so good
Oh my God
Itd be so wonderful
Well my ex bought this hot sauce the other day at uh at Giant at uh Giant Eagle
It comes in a medicine bottle
It comes
in a medicine bottle and you take it out and it has an eyedropper
So we put an eye dropper like one drop of
the stuff mixed in with what we made for dinner that night
and it was so hot
It was
ridiculous like we were both crying
So it was like pure capsaicin
and
its like
yeah
And I dont know
Im not
Im sure capsaicin is regulated
Well yeah
It is
Ah otherwise otherwise you would put that stuff in a spray bottle and carry it around instead of mace
Then it would melt someones skin off
Um yeah
Pretty much
There are there are there are laws regulating how strong you can make mace
Right well
Thats why you cant buy pure capsaicin
Or actually I mean there are laws regulating civilian use
I like those capsaicin paintballs
Id like that
That sounds
that sounds terrible
No its fantastic
Theyre high velocity paintballs filled with um capsaicin powder
Um so notonly do you get the paintball welts you know but then like you cant breathe
Oh no
Thats so mean
And they have splash damage too
So you can like shoot one there you know
and then like going in your eye
Yeah isnt that grea
No
Use them in public
For only two hundred eighty bucks
Ow
Oh God how many do you ge
Ah ah ah two hundred eighty bucks for for for uh for a semi automatic uh its its a little bit bigger than a pistol a bit lighter uh its c o two powered
Its basically a high velocity paint ball gun
and you get uh you get as many as about twenty practice shots and like
ten real shots
Uh
Its set up to six shots a second
Uh
Law enforcement can get uh like can like actually get automatic paintball things for the hoppers
You know
that kicks
It also looks silly cus theres a hopper full of capsaicin fluid on top
Its like what the is that paintball gun paintball gu
It would be great if they had SuperSoakers and just like a lot of capsaicin powder
and just a little bit of water
you know and then youre at a riot and your like
oh you cant do anything to me stupid cop with your
little water gun
Spray
It would be better if it was like if it was hydrochloric acid
Well hydrochloric acid would just kill a lot of people
I dont think thats the intent
I think the intent is just to melt their skin off
Thats it
You know a couple of shots is enough to incapacitate someone
And theyre not restricted in any wa
I believe they are restricted and possibly not legal in several states It it its new technology so I dont think there are laws for it in a lot of places
I made the posters
You made poster
You made poster
I designed posters
Remember I was asking you for slogan
Were they put anywher
Yeah
Wered you put them u
You gotta put those up
No I never never printed them or anything
You should really
Thats like the class where I did all this like did most of the homework and just didnt finish it
Just hand it in like that
Thats my Chemistry class right now
I know but I like to finish it and then hand it in
I hate handing in the unfinished one
I know I was yelling at you about that one paper in history
Oh geez
Did you never turn that i
No he did
No I did
I got a B in the class
The day before you left righ
Handed in four or five papers
Half your semesters wor
Yup
Interp and Argument I emailed my last two papers from home
I went home and then wrote them and then emailed them back
I did that with my French class
Yes
She was just like was like
She sent out an email out to like four of us and was just like

So now I gotta go beg for a
completion chance after the uh
Thats too bad
Yeah
Sandage is cool hell do it
Then whyd he fail you anytim
You know
So anyway
So rolls on this weekend
Were gonna time the freeroll and hill twos hopefull
Hill twos and freerolls I think should be priority
Were gonna have enough times on the hills
I mean
righ
Um
yeah no were not gonna
Yeah
Time the backhills this weekend
Yeah
Were just not
But can we talk about
who you think we should like pencil in for getting timed on hill two
Nice
Uh
Boxerman
Boxerman would be a good one
Alright
Boxerman
me and Treacy
Maybe uh
Yeah you and Treacy
Maybe h maybe Healy
Maybe Sean
Its a long shot
But itd be good if he was good there because well hes not gonna be good anywhere else so
Yeah
Hes not gonna be great anywhere else Sam
Thats true
Hes gonna be good everywhere else
Thats true
Hes a great kid
I wouldnt mind getting timed if we had
Oh yeah Scott
Any chance of it
Oh
Well take that
Part of the highest placing B team ever
Hill two
Fifth place
Wheres your troph
Thats good thats good
One of those shorter ones
Actually its one of the taller ones now
What kind of person do we need on hill tw
I dont even know
Its impossible to describe
Theres just
You cant
Theres like
You cant judge a person
You really want speed
You really want strength
Like
I think speed is more important
Eh
Its like you can get it running faster so you dont have to shove it as hard
Or you could be slow but give it a huge shove
But if youre slow youre still slow over the whole hill
Yeah
Ed sucked last year
Yeah
He was with the B team ther
Yeah
And he did he had a shitty rollou
Uh he was slow on the uh
I mean his time was just slow
He got a shitty rollout or n
It wasnt good
I mean Derrick had a really bad hill three so probably
Derricks hill three I mean
What was the hill three tim
These times are all sketchy but Derrick on raceday had an eleven five
Which is slower than push practice by a lot
Last yea
Which one did a hill thre
Last year
So
Good thing we dont have to worry about getting him again
Ed
Yeah
Didnt Ryan Gelfand graduat
Yeah
Yeah
Hes on our soccer team
Wha
If youd look at the list hes definitely
Hes like the first name on it
Did he graduat
I
he told me he was
He must have graduated
Hes older than us I know that
He was like Im not pushing
And he might be doing something
Because
I dont know yeah I guess hes faculty or something
Facult
Maybe staff
Staff
Alright
I cant remember that one
Aw did you see all the pushers on ther
Hu
No I didnt look at it actually
All the pushers
We got Jocelyn Karen Ben
Nice
Awesome
I want to see someone
Indoor socce
Is that what were talking abou
Lets get
Lets get someone injured hu
What do you sa
Can we play real hard core and get someone hur
Maybe Jocelyn maybe twist an ankl
Yeah that would be good
Better than Nick
Were talking indoor soccer thoug
Yeah
Yes
I like indoor soccer
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow nigh
Yeah like nine or ten oclock
Hot damn
Where are yo
Scotts with it
Am I not getting email
All our whole uh two game season
Keep the team together for through that
Two games
Its the whole seaso
Yeah
And whats the point of the if you forfeit one youre eliminate
Who else are they gonna pla
No no no if you only if you forfeit two
If you forfeit one youre still in it
Thats Margot said a different thing
Yeah Margot said if you for either one of them youre like out
Whats the
I dont understand
But on the uh schedule posted in the UC it says
the normal policy
Its just like its the standard policy
Oh
The after after your second forfeitry youre out
And they said we only have two games so I just thought we could miss one and
Yeah
Right
That was one of my first thoughts
I was like
that doesnt sound right
No there are seriously so many divisions though
Its hilarious
Reall
Theres three teams in every division and like the division letters go up to like S or Z or something
I dont know
Why do they have that many division
Whos in our divisio
Did you loo
I dont think it was anybody noteworthy
Um
Is Bassketcase all good for tonigh
We dont have to do anything crazy for it do w
I mean its like
Yeah
It has a drop wheel in the back
It looks good
Bassketcase is going tonigh
On hill on
I know thats
What are yo
Drun
Thats what I was saying
Its not
Thats just mean
We dont have that much control over it really
Its like
I know
I know
Scotts saying its
No
Its strength training
Scotts trying to
Scotts trying to downplay
I know it has an effect but it has an effect on all hills
Its strength training
But hill one
I know thats
is like the hardest one
So many people have like
Alright maybe its just Ronette
But I feel like its been more people that they are like
I tried a hill one once
Im never doing it again
Things like that
Just cause its like
There wasnt much of an option
I mean it its either that or only one buggy
Whats the other bugg
Jess
Theyre gonna fight me
I dont know
Whoever knows whats going on
Well tell everyone theyll get one on each
I know but then you want to get your first or your second
I know everyone wants to go first on Blackjack though
I want to
I know I want to
Make some of the people go first on Val and then
Just tell them that
Its its tough
I dont I dont like the situation either Sarah
Its strength training
But its also like one of like the few data points we have on everybody
Somebodys gonna get screwed and get Bassketcase twice and not make B team
Im calling it right now
Ill make sure it doesnt
We are recording buggies on all these righ
We have that
Yeah
All that information
Mm not for
Not really
If by yeah you mean no
Well last night was all Blackjack
Last night was all Blackjack
Ohhhh ok
And then before that was Insite and Blackjack labeled
Yeah we did that one
Is the other book does the other book have
Hill five was all Bandit
Hill five was all Bandit
So we do still have that
We should make sure to keep track of that information
Yeah
And we do still have buggy
Like days where well be timing hill one
Do we have the total weight combinations of buggy drivers and
Whyd you write both time
You cant just average them for me or somethin
We have two more
Oh yeah what is your policy on tha
We only have two more days
after this
Two more days of push practice
One of which will get rained out
What are you talking abou
Plus wha
Oh
Im confused
Im confused
I know I know
Why why only two nights this wee
Im talking this one
And Scott was like
we have more days to time hill two
Hill one
But really we only have two more days of push practice on hill one
I see
That was just on hill one
Yeah
I thought you were saying push practice in general
No no no
No no no no no
The same buggys gonna be out on hill one all the time
What was it last wee
Not the same
Pushers have the inflexible schedule
Like March
Do drivers just sign up for a day
Because you know sometimes you have a test on Thursday
Sometimes you
Whats toda
Twenty three
Is it generally supposed to be the schedule thoug
My its close to midnight so my watch is in between
Its twenty three or twenty four
One
Tomorrows the twenty fourth
Three twenty three
Why did I do tha
No
Tomorrows the twenty fourth
Today is the twenty third
Which have you been counting e
What was last Wednesda
Monday was the twenty first
Seventeen
Or Sunday was the twenty first which was uh
The equinox
My policy is
I dont know
Some of these are so different
How are we gonna get their time
Thats why you average
Now I spelled her name wrong
We never even put more than one time down
Carla did
Hill five Carla did it
Oh ok
How do you do thi
Average the
Like I dont know this one
We just take the lowest time
Aw you d
Yeah
Wha
I mean if theyre close
You just take the lowes
As long as youre consistent
Why dont you averag
I mean weve had different numbers by a little
Because we dont have a calculator
Its usually its not like a significant
No when we had three people we took the middle
Write em both down
Write em both down
That might explain some things
Scotts in control of the top of the hill Sam
You said youd never been there
I know or I would have changed this policy
You dont know the dynamic of the top of the hill
Oh just write all the information down
Thats so bad
What does this sa
Im not writing it down but
Shows the middle one
Bertucci just Bertucci just said youre in charge
I am in charge yeah
Aw just write them all down and well average in excel
Aw we can just put em in excel and average
Aw that doesnt bother yo
That makes my skin crawl
Just taking the lowest one
Wh
Thats like goes against every like
scientific statistical
Thats like goes against the spirit of science
Oh no
Sure you have more than one data point
Take the one youd rather see
Ohhh
Let the pushers decide what their time was
That was about a ten and a half
Sure well use that
The lowest one
Dont make it sound so bad we took the middle one last night
We had three watches and we took the middle one
Yeah when we had three we took the middle
Uh oh boy
Take the middle and round down which happens to be the first when you only have two
Scientific method
As long as youre consistent
They were always really close so
I mean
Eh
Were talking like two tenths of a second off
Two tenths
Yeah
This is one thirty eight and seventy one
I guess if you like figure it out
Wha
Thats three tenths
There were a couple times when Scott was real late
Right I mean
Obviously were not counting the times when I screwed up the time
And Preysman every single time when the light got covered he just started his stop watch
Itd just be a flurry of clicking
Preysman was doing a lot of pushing
Thats funny
Hed do you start shit stop
Stop reset star
Yeah
Yeah thats guaranteed good timing
Oh God when I was hanging out with Kappa
They were
Megan was doing the flashlight
And she was doing like uncover the flashlight like all different times
And like after like seven rolls she was like
It like came up somehow or I like mentioned it and she was like
yeah I dont really know when youre supposed to uncover it
I was like
When the nose crosses the line
Oh my God
She was doing like the nose the back of the buggy the pusher
Even if you dont know just pick one
When the when the load shove goes
Like
She didnt have any of consistency at all
She was just doing a mix of all the different things it could be
See thats data points there
At least you dont just take like the first one of every set
Average average
hey Stusheena
Stu
hey
Stu should give birth in outer space
hmm
outer space e
with robots
Stu
did you find your boo
no not yet
oh geez
Im working on the stuff
oh thats good
have you guys seen a thing of memory recentl
no
no
wha
those lil cute little things
memory for like a laptop board
whoa
like recently
yes
well I when did so you lost it recentl
no have you seen it recently
well so
yeah I might have it
this is yours from a long long time ag
like a couple weeks ago
oh I I think I have one of yours from like September
okay
here you go
okay
put it in the blinking ◉jar◉ maybe
what are you up t
um Im going to think some more about what I just read
no
couldnt you just go to bed
what did you just read Stu
I was reading about the motion or rather the constraints you can place on what happens when you uh have an object sliding with friction
um some sort of Minikowski sum
you see this core formulation is only through planar objects and so
I think that it it extends because the force can it can project all the forces so that they they lie in a plane with the center of mass and all the torques and the sums are about the same
well of course Stu
I mean like you know the thing like um
yeah yeah yeah
line of force like if you have a force it can be anywhere along the line and you get the same torque and sum of force
I never heard that before but it makes sense
a system of protein transport in the golgi
will have a population of n identical proteins
each can be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum
I have an endoplasmic reticulum
I bet you do
do you remember what it doe
uh no
but Rori just told you
are you interrupting St
yeah that was the general idea with something even more um
obscure
fascinating yeah
whoa okay biologys a lot more applicible than Stus force lines but I dunno
sorry Stu
Slashdot seems to think Epson is releasing this printer just because um
the team eight thin
yeah women now dominate the consumer electronics market
I think they were um
I think the implication in the story was that like or things dont cater to women and then the guy was like but they do dominate the market or maybe I just read it wrong
yeah I cant find it
I dont think
okay
I dont think Ive seen it in a while but Ill let you know
okay
youre talking about a little flash memor
yeah Dell wants it
Dell wants i
yeah
wh
wait flash memor
like a little io usb um what do you call the
oh oh Im thinking like a simm
oh okay cause I have yours of that
really
it was it was in here for a long time
what is it
I dunno
someone told me it had your resume on it
I think your resumes on it
or something like that
oh that thing
yeah yeah yeah
oh you have tha
well it was in here
dude
I was keeping an eye on it but
yeah
I even told you I mean
I havent seen that in a long time
yeah it was in here
I dont I dont know where it went though
yeah
Stu probably ate it or something
oh yeah
probably
theyre so tiny
he gets a little munchy
silly Stu
yeah well Ill let you know if I find it
like mmm force vectors
Its true
okay
ah crap
how long should I record fo
one million years
yep
actually I was thinking 0of taking a shower and I dunno if the noise would uh mess up your recording or not
I dunno Im probably gonna stop fairly soon
well do you think you have enough like
I
I could bitch about this boy if you want
have been recording for thirty three minutes
whats that
what bo
its some boy whos an asshole
wait say wha
no hes just some guy who I dont like
I enjoy bitching about him
oh you could bitch about him oh I see I see
so if you wanted to you know
I dont wanna force conversation here cause
oh okay
yeah
I could try and figure out who this guy is on Orkut who says that he wants to get to know me better
a friend of a frien
yeah
oh reall
whos he a friend o
uh Jen Lin
oh
thats why hes
he goes to CM

no
no
no your mom
mmm no

other measuring cup
you used a small one
no like the big rexan one

what does that entail
thats the purpose of Orkut isnt i
I dunno
he invited me to some party

Where did they have the party down in the basement or throughout the hous
Basement
Uh huh
Laura was down ther
Only sometimes
Oh
Shes like
We dont allow underage drinking in this house
She was joking
Is that what she sai
They were playing games uhh like college plays ping pong Yeah beer pong
Beer pong
You throw ping pong balls in the beer and you have to drink how ever much is in it
Theres no more beer in the house anymore
Do you know how much there wa
No
How muc
Atleast uhh fifty bottles of Corona Extra and same with Heineken
Thats a lot of beer
So
It was a mixed party righ
guys and girl
Mmh hmm
Anything else going o
Some people left early because the beer was out
Is that tru
Would you ever allow i
No
You have to be twenty one to be drink
and not only that
Even if you guys were all twenty one
you have to drive home
No no no I wouldnt have a thirty five people party becaue when they leave if theyre drunk from here and they get into an accident the person that hosts the party is responsible
What if they go home and they go back out again by acciden
Mmh its your fault
I dont know
I dont know but Im telling you its very very strict
Whats stric
The uh host liquor laws
What if they go out an hour later and get in a car acciden
its your faul
Yeah if you gave them too much to drink yeah
If you gave them anything to drink
What about about the next da
Mm
No no
the next day
No obviously no
the alcohol has worn off
But if they if they have over a uh the legal limit and its because you gave it to them then youre responsible until they go under the legal limit
even if theyre under the legal limit and they get into an accident I think youre responsible
Thats why people dont have big parties anymore
Really its a big issue
Nobody should drink
Yeah
Or any uh or any other type of drug
Isnt that whats her nam
Jamie got so drunk
she had four whole bottles of Corona
Wha
Jamie had four bottles of Corona
Holy
She is in ninth grade
fourtee
fourteen or fifteen
Shes gonna be fifteen this year
Mmh hmm
Oh
She can drink that muc

I think theres the greens are in someones hand
I did this with somebody else and the other girl was like a really soft talker
You just have to make sure you know where the mic is and make sure its pointing towards the direction
like if youre facing in that direction its probably not going to pick up as well
Ok
You just think about it
I mean its just like we record stuff for music all the time and we have to make sure we know where the mic is so that it picks up on us
That goes to show how much I know what Im doing
Tape recorders
Its one of those technological things
fun
that you know I dont know very well but I can use a tape recorder
Ok thats good because I cant
So guess what
Wha
Mr Thompson told me that Ive got an A for the semester
Oh yes
Because of my breathrough
He like came in during intermission at the concert and he was like
Thats what Ive been trying to get you to do all semester
Youve just earned your A
Yes finally
So what breakthrough was thi
He was trying to get me to play louder and fuller and with like a better sound for most of the semester
And it finally like
it wasnt working
Like he was trying to like do everything he could think of to play better
And then he gave me a new reed
Like he gave me his new reeds that hes using
And like I put the reed on and ⁎boom⁎
It was like perfect
It was so much better
It was exactly what he was trying to get me to do and it was an equipment problem
Oh wow
It was not a lack of understanding between me and him
And it was not for lack of his telling me what to do and me following what he wants me to do
I just needed different reeds
Oh this is really good
I know
It was such a simple answer to a problem weve been trying to fix all semester
Wait
So how old was your other ree
Its not that it was old
Its a different type
Oh
This type was better
Ok
Like well its better for me not for everybody
Yeah
Some people dont like them but I like them
Oh ok
So I have to buy two boxes of reeds tomorrow
Oh jeez
Wait how often do you have to change the
These last longer so it will probably last me like a month
And then I have to start breaking in new reeds
Wait only a mont
Wow
Well my old ones last only about a week
Oh jeez
Thats pretty bad
Reed
Yeah theyre pretty expensive to do
Oh no
But the new ones apparently for him Mr Thompson hed been using them for a month and he got eight out of the ten that he liked
Whereas in a normal box of the ones that Im using now they last about a week and I like about three out of the box of ten
Wow
So its a lot better deal
Yeah
Definitely
So did you go out on Saturda
Yep
And it was fu
Yeah
I wore my skirt
Reall
Yeah
Very nice
And its pink
Pin
Yeah its like the only pink thing that I have
Thats fabulous
Actually if my mom hadnt been here I probably would have gone to a party on Friday night
Yeah
The sophomore vocal majors were throwing their cast party for the um for the convocation that they did on Thursday
And part of it like revolved around their solfege class
Like there was a big scene and so you know everyone in our solfege class was invited
Everyone was told about it so I was like
I have to spend time with my mother so I wont be able to go
Yeah especially since she like came all the way from Texas
Exactly
exactly
But I did go shopping
Shopping is fun
Do you want to see what the stuff looks lik
Yes
Ok
Heres the shirt
this is pretty plain
Oh its a really pretty color though
I like this color
It happens to be one of the few that looks good on me
And my skirt I hung up
Oooh thats pretty too
Its this nice fabric
And its like
its really long which I love
I love longer skirts
And all this fabric it sort of like goes out
Theres so much of it
Oh so its like a poofy one
Yeah
So its like a big skirt
oh thats fun
I love
So thats the new skirt
And then the shoes
Shoes are so
Oh yeah we have to see the shoes
Ok
heres the tennis shoes
Oh those are pretty
Black and pink
Theyre kind of like Cathys
kind of
I like them
I was just looking at them and they fit better than the other ones I was trying out
And these are so adorable
These are my new concert shoes
Oh those are really pretty
Wow
And well what I was looking at a pair of black pants at the Gap that were fabulous
They fit well and everything but they werent long enough though
Oh no
They would have been okay if like they came down to here and they had a cuff so if I had taken the cuff out then pressed them they would have been okay but Im going to go online and see if I can order them in longs
Because this is a regular and most Gap pants come in a long
Oh I hope you get them
But if not my mom will just buy some at the Gap in Houston and will let them out and then cause they just werent long enough
Like they were fine normally but I had bought the shoes already and so I like put the shoes on with them and they werent long enough to go with the shoes
Oh darn
So that wouldnt have worked
I hate it when that happens
So since you know the whole purpose of buying black shoes is for is for concerts
You know black pants anything black I buy is for my concerts
Yeah
I wear other black but still
Thats the main purpose
So are you doing anything for carniva
Um
I have a recital to go to on Wednesday night
A friend a violin player Andy is doing her violin recital her junior recital on Wednesday night and shes playing The Four Seasons by Vivaldi
Wow
Shes playing the whole thing
So shes playing all Four Seasons
So
and she asked me to go to class last Friday and I was like
sure Why no
So Wednesday night Ill be doing that
Is this at Carnegie Hal
No its at um Kresge
Oh ok
So
thatll be fun
So I wont be doing anything Carnival related then
And Ill have to go to carnival like to the midway on Thursday or Friday
Yeah
Because Saturday I have to do PYSO
Are they making you go to PYSO on Saturday even though its carniva
Well theyre not related to the school
Oh yeah
So they dont care
Yeah I totally
I totally forgot
So yeah
I have PYSO on
and its like three weeks till our concert so were getting close
Im gonna need to come and see you at your PYSO concert
Yeah do
Its on May first
Ok
They day before finals start
Oh great
And the day before my jury of course
Oh man
Im going to have a jury on Monday
Mr Thompson has already decided what Im going to play for my recital
for my recital next year
We were talking about it today like we got all my jury things and he was like
This would be a really good recital piece and we need to go ahead and start thinking about your recital music
And hes like
So well do this itll be like the show piece the main thing
And well have a couple of other shorter pieces for you to do
so I was like Ok
so he was like
I think you should do this this and this
it would be a good like contrast
so I was like
ok sure whatever
So Ill have to order some of that over the summer and you know get working on it
So youre going to be practicing for a long time
Im always practicing
Thats true
I didnt practice today cause I had a lesson
But most other days I practice
Its a musicians life
We get used to it
Thats true
I am so excited though
we get two days off of school
So am I
Its not carnival that Im excited about so much as that we like have a three day week
The only thing I have definite plans that for carnival is the fact that I plan on getting more sleep
Yeah
than I normally do
I can always use some time to catch up on my sleep and having like three days in a row where I dont have to wake up early is going to be amazing
When do you usually have to wake u
Um
Mondays and Wednesdays I have to wake up at eight thirty so that I can take a shower before I go to class and stuff so I dont have class until eleven thirty
Tuesday Thursday and Friday I have class at nine thirty so I usually take showers the night before so I get up at like my alarm is set at seven thirty but I dont usually end up getting up until like eight fifteen
Oh ok
So
its closer to the time that I get up on the other days
But if I dont set my alarm for that early I wouldnt get up that early
And then I get up at like nine fifteen on Saturdays so that I can you know shower and all that stuff and have time to eat before I go to PYSO
Cause I have to catch a bus like twenty five minutes before it starts to get downtown in time to warm up
Ok
and it wont get better
Yeah well actually it will get better because once Im like not in school anymore most musicians dont rehearse until the afternoons
Its not usually in the mornings
Oh so youll get to sleep
Cause a lot of us a lot of musicians like they do their paid paying gigs and their concerts and stuff theyre at night
So they dont have them getting up early in the morning after theyve been doing these late night gigs and stuff
So theyre getting most of their rehearsals done in the afternoon
Oh ok
And I think thats when Mr Thompson has most of his students
Every once in a while he has a morning one when they need extra rehearsals but usually they are in the afternoons
Oh so it does get better for you
It does get better
okay
Hae Na were going to put you in bed as soon as were done talking
No
Yes
Im reading
Youre not gonna read
You feel like throwing up
Im reading about the Cubans dammit
Oh fine
But youre not gonna youre not gonna read while you feel like throwing up
Theyre all unhappy
Like you

Thats why youre gonna go to bed
oka
Cubans
No no Cubans
Bedtime
The Cubans are uh twelve hundred miles away
And all sleeping

Theyre all in bed
If we wanted to we could just take the whole island over right now
These Cubans were exiled I dont think theyre sleeping
Theyre in Miami theyre also sleeping
These ones arent in Miami
All exiled Cubans went to Miami
Oh my God no they didnt
Well all exiled Cubans go to bed before midnight
Theyre healthy
Oh my God
Wealthy and wise
Well maybe not wealthy
Cubans are wealthy
You can barely keep your eyes open
I feel like throwing up
Thats why youre gonna go to bed
Thats the whole point
If you feel like throwin up close your close your eyes
And just come on
For the love of whatevers holy in this world
The Pope died
In memory of
And whats the second part of tha
And so did Mitch Hedburg
And Terri Schiavo
Things come in threes
Oh yeah
Terri died
We talked about that in preceptorship
About Terr
aparently were on a first name basis with her
Well
What did ya talk abou
My US Congress did write a bill that affected her life
So yeah I think were all on a first name basis with er
Terri
What did you talk abou
Oh how doctors felt about it
Oh
How did doctors fee
I dunno I didnt talk to any of em
Well
Yeah but you said you talked about it
You said that you talked about it
We talked about what other peoples doctors said about it for preceptorship
okay well then what did they sa
I didnt talk about it with my doctor
Well what did the other doctors sa
okay What did the other doctors sa
Oh
The doctors that voiced an opinion
That everyone should have a living will
Thats what my mother said
And that its really an individual thing
mmm nn mmm
Stuff like that
And after seeing this happen to a lot of people like this case isnt like doctors are always pulling tubes out of people
This isnt something thats different
Nope
Its just this case became like national news
Yup
But theyre performing these procedures even at Shadyshide or Presby all the time
n one person one kid in the group was able to sit in on it
Thats pretty intense
Yeah
So
I still feel like puking
Thats why youre gonna go to bed
Cubans

I have to talk about them tomorrow

Dude it sucks to be an immigrant
what is this book that youre readin
The Vulernable Observer
Its about this girl whose parents were Cuban immigrants
And they came over and its about how shes toiling over whether or not to go back to Cuba
Howd they get over here in a converted fifty three Chev
Hm
No in a raft
I dont know
I think they flew
Oh thats not fun
My theory on the matter is that any group of layman that can turn a fifty three Chevy into a raft that can go ninety miles deserve to stay in this country
Yeah
Like we could use them at Ford
Or Chevy
At Ford
Oh it hurts to laugh Im gonna puke
Why dont we go lie down now

Thats not gonna help because I cant sleep cause Im gonna throw up
I think weve got sleeping gas somewhere
Are you a dentis

I was gonna make a really bad joke but I chose not to
What could you possibly make a joke of that of hu

I dunno we dont wanna know
No
Like gas chamber
Wha
Man youre morbid
Well I dont know I cant think of anything else to make a joke
You did say the joke was pretty bad
Yeah so I went to the extreme
What was the jok
I was gonna say this is college Im sure we could find some roofies somewhere
Oh roofies
Wha
No I dont want roofies
okay
Itll certainly put you to sleep
Oh dear
Wouldnt I still be experiencing whatever but I just wont remember i
Uh no
Oh
Itll knock ya right out

No its a sensitivity
How are I know
A hypersensitivity

If by contageous you mean genetic
Yknow allergies arent a big deal
They just suck
And Im like unless its to peanuts and you can die
Or if its like me and its to everything except pennicilin

Yea
Come on over
here see see how I made a little robot out of the little styrofoam with the toothpick
Mmm
Thats what were doing were making little robots
Name made her whole family
And me
her mom dad Name and Sam
Me uh
Name made her whole family
You dont have to make your whole family but you can
heres one someone made
heres the body the head the arms and the legs
Neat
Pretty neat huh
You know what Im
Wha
going to try making this
I think thats a good idea
Hmm remember if it was
today
you have what toda
A nacket
Reall
something else
now I need some tape
a caterpillar
A caterpilla
need some tape
Ado a na
need some tape
Say it agai
Nas
Need some tape
Some tape for wha
this
Well with this project were only going to use the tape to put your names on the bags
how do you think you could get this to go like
how do you wanna connect i
like thi
With the ti
You think you could use a piece of styrofoam like this mayb
And stick one in there connect it like tha
What about tha
Da
Now youve got them connected
Done
Youre all don
Whoah thats a lot
uhh right now on gambit
okay
I have uh a partially populated database
well I can show you the
Wow
Nice you know what this is
Exactly
this is put it this way I like this much better just just visual the look I like this much better than what we saw the first time
this is this is really nice
This is uhhhh I mean just in terms of just a nice look a feel this is good
yeah
Thats gonna hafta change
the Lt doesnt think its professional enough looking but you know what for now whatever
what what what has to chang
uh the the whats in the white spot the actual content
Oh okay
I agree with that and n part of the thing to be honest with this is you can actually take out these uh take out the the the uh the uh underlining
mmhmm
uh with a style sheet and change this so it looks a little more obvious like a link
cause right now its gray too and grayed out usually means not active
yeah
So if you made this something
And what Ild consider is Ild consider just using regular blue
Like try to match this blue here
You know just like take use the eyedropper tool find out what that that color blue is
mmhmm
And then set in your style sheet set this to be the same color blue as up here so that it matches
And get rid of this underlining because it does look unprofessional
I and its
Sometimes whats nice is if you can set the style sheet so that when you when you when you roll over it it will it will underline
right
I know how to do that
its just
But when it looks like this it
But but I think this is I think this is a big improvement over what we over what you had before so I think this is a good thing
okay what about the database
okay so here basically is the database
um its already there on gambit
I have everything except for knowledge populated
Because knowledge is going to be a pain
Oh so you already populated this in the s
Yes
okay
This whats posted here some of the pages that actually use the calender and article tables
the website actually uses the calender and article tables
okay
Um yeah
Also in that packet is the structure for the site and such
okay the okay I got it
first I was thinging vab but I see visitor applicant battalion
mmhmm
okay interesting way of doing permissions
Do you have a better ide
because I didnt really know how to do that
uummm you will a lot of times usually permissions
this is I mean this is one way of doing it
you know the interesting thing about doing this is um the way I would first thing I would do it is sort of a unix way of doing it which is with a number
Um and if you use one two and four as the numbers
so um a one means only visitors can do it
Two means only applicants can get it
a four means only battalion
Six two and four means applicant and battalion
Five is the visitor and battalion
visitor and applican
See what Im saying
if you use one if you use one two th if you use one two four than three is visitor an and applicant
That would be seve
mmhmm
That would probably be easier to deal with in the code
Right and so well tha well that thats how permissions are set in unix
mmhmm
Um Although you can also set them
you know they also you know the uh r uh r w x but
but that ends up being numbers too righ
Right it it really it gets converted into numbers I mean to make it easier for some people because they dont remember the numbers
but its really uh one two four
Because the thing is you know seven means everybody has access to this six means only you know two of the levels five only two of the levels three only two of the levels
and so anyways this is this would work
you know and this is fine but I mean anyways Im bringing unix to this
dont thats um the way to do it
but if this works then you can do this
but Im just telling you thats the way its often done
I havent started using it yet so using the permissions yet
okay well
I just displayed all articles for everyone at the moment
okay thats fine well you can think about that that unix approach cause the nice thing is its just numbers um and its easier and you dont have to parse the number and just
Um you know trying to like you know so um
and cause you can set the permission level for and what um yeah so lets see
k Can I ask a question about scholarshi
Sure
Scholarship is is the list of all the
is a list of the different scholarships you can ge
But I thought
isnt there
okay I guess just I dunno
How many scholarships are ther
I thought theres just like
Theres like seve
Seven different kind of scholarships
I think s
Yeah
reall
mmhmm
okay like some partial support some full support or different branches
Things like that
okay cause see I just know ROTC scholarships so I just thought theres a
I didnt even know there were that many until I went and lookayed and you know got all the information from the old website
okay thats fine
I just I just thought well if theres one scholarship why do we have this as a table you know
its just
no no Im just just yeah I just didnt know
its my own ignorance so um
enh cause people who come into ROTC dont have scholarships in the beginning
a lot of them so thats
Um can I ask a question on class
uh huh
tbl class class id you said usually three two one oh one is usually three two one oh one mean just is there a code to the why you chose than number instead of like one two thre
Theyre like classes through the university
so Im using the class id that the university uses
oh oh oh oh oh oh okay
okay I understand that right now okay
But I cant
I was thinking I was I was thinking about class like like the junior class in ROTC the senior class in ROTC okay Im thinking of a different thing
So where are you going to use this so wheres this class table hows this class table get used in the system
Um its a display of the classes that we take
currently its changing
like the command or CNET actually or NETC or whatever they call the education board is changing it
So that will have to be able to be changed by the administrator for sure because it changes periodically
okay right right
okay
thats fine
but that shouldnt too hard to do that
okay um
Staff turns over a lot so thats gonna have to be really easy to change
knowledge changes because uh part of knowledge is knowing your chain of command and that changes constantly
mmhmm mmhmm
Im scholarships
okay °okay knowledge°
mmhmm
what kind of stuffs going in knowledg
Drill Knowledge
its a whole smorgasbord of stuff so I have to leave it really open ended um
okay because I see a drill title and a drill text
Yeah
Do is does I guess what Im wondering about is what about like an active field like if this is a drill do I have is this drill always have to appear or can this drill sometimes be taken offline sometime be put back online
I mean do I have to keep reentering lets say I use the same drill later on do I are am I going to delete it am I going to reenter it
It should always be there
I dont want it to never ever dissappear
I want the amount of drill knowledge on this site to be as much as possible so Ill always be adding to it
changing a thing here or there maybe but since most knowledge never changes its mostly adding new knowledge
oh oh okay
okay although you can edit it righ
mmhmm I should be able to edit it because I will have to change things like the chain of command and stuff
Well what would happen if something he want you wanted to take something off would you could you delete i
Would it cause any problems to delete it
would you wanna delete it or do wanna still have it active deactive
I spose hm
I mean you might wanna think about what on the off chance that I want to remove something
Lets say a controversy occurs I wanna just take something off real quick
I mean you could always delete it but then you know it might be easier to just deactivate it and just have a boolean
You know field active
its just some
You think I should do that for the rest of them as wel
or just that
Well kuh article is the other one I was gonna talk about is should be you know display you know with a boolean you know so that way you only show the articles that you want to display
You might want to save articles you know save past articles or whatever for various reasons um but you might want to have a display field there
Its basically boolean the same kind of thing
display it dont display it
You could also go to point of if somebody wanted to say dont display it until such and such a date or display it until like a start date end date
mmhmm
Where what itll do is itll find the articles based on the start date or based on the end date
Make sens
Yeah I was gonna do it by the timestamp and then I realized that its probably easier and better to just
The timestamp is when they put it in the article in righ
Right
Right
Ok
I think I need to do it where I need your permission
okay
Do you give me your permission that this might be on the interne
I do
Do you Ar
Just say
I do
You cant force someone to do it
Do you give me your permission
Just say it dammit
So anyway when I was in church I was as Bill and I were walking into church I was like I love being Catholic
Its so fashionable
Why are you holding it up like thi
Why cant it be natura
Why is being Catholic natura
No
Why cant
oh fashionable
Not natural
No because everyone has money and like
Thats not true
the Jews have all the money
But its really funny though because Catholics like have its why cant we just go to a room not have a like and have a piano and a cross on the wal
Why does there have to be a marble crosses and like
The church does have a lot of money but thats because of the olden days
Why do Why does that church in California have to cost a hundred million dollar
Exactly like why cant it be a shac
Because you know religion is deep down and whatever
So I was thinking Im gonna do a piece where people go up to get like the body of Christ like the Eucharist righ
And thats a photograph right there and then the cameras
Theres also a camera here
After that they they get ahblahblahblah
After they get the Eucharist theyre gonna go and walk but walk like a fashion runway away
Oh thatll be cool
But I think i its the tradition because back in the day the church had all the money
Obviously I mean they still have money
Thats just the tradition
I feel like the church has a lot of money
There had to be like the beginning of time when it was just like
Yeah Im sure in the beginning of time
And then they got money and then they got money
When When was the whole Roman Catholic revolution
Yeah when Jesus died
Today
It started today
This is when we renew our baptismal promises
Thats what I mean that like when the church started making money wasnt when jesus died
Oh I dont know
Yeah because Im sure then thats when it was shacks like Peter made the church
Roman Catholic Church didnt form until the fall of the Roman Empir
Yeah because everyone was dumb and they couldnt read anymore
The Enlightenment was over
Yeah Enlightenment
And that is it
Two minutes have passed
No I need five minutes
Of this
I dont believe in it
Here Ari
This is the check of life
I gave five dollars into the
This is the cup of blood
I gave five dollars to the church today
I felt bad
Five dollar
I wish it was like two thousand
There is a light

And you owe me like thirty dollars
No were gonna owe you a lot of money
Yeah

Remember to speak out so that your comments will be audible on the recording
okay the topic that you have been asked to discuss concerns ethnic racial or gender specific organizations
Does the presence of such organizations in school promote segregatio
Do you have any other ideas for reducing segregation within the student bod
I think that of ⁎course⁎ they promote segregation but I think I think that word in and of itself has a negative connotation
I dont like using that word self segregation as far as those kind of clubs go but their whole purpose is to create a context in which people who ⁎dont⁎ fit the status quo or the majority feel comfortable where they can go and be themselves
yeah
and talk the way they want to talk and share share an identity that they may or may not have to hide throughout the day in a in a different context
yeh
and so I I think if segregation is the word you want to call it ⁎fine⁎ but yes
they do do it and I think its okay
I do too
because I think that and so much of your experience is based on like the ⁎whole⁎ world and like how you you know talk to everyone in the world but then if you really want to talk about your specific experience college or life or whatever if you are around people who are experienced something thats more similar similar to you I think that like talking to them about it makes it easier to understand and like makes it I just think you can relate to them a little bit better
I think segregation makes me think maybe like a negative connotation but like I mean that I agree that its segregated but in a sense its the way you gotta feel comfortable
in that thats what like Emily just said like if thats what you gotta do to be able to get along err to get to get to where you wanna be comfortable in life youre gonna have to find somewhere where you feel comfortable first among people that youre comfortable with and then you can take that outside of segregation
But I agree that they are healthy
I think the only negative aspect that I can think of is that when those types of groups are prevalent on your campus
inclusive err
ummm
that number one I think people view them as as a reactionary thing like oohh they couldnt fit in so they decided to make this club
and thats not I guess maybe thats not the best perception for others to have
and kind of relating to that the second thing is that if you want to bring other people into that into that group its your responsibility then for you to reach out
like you cant you cant expect the majority whose not included in your ss quote on quote self segregated club to wanna be part of it
like after you decide to start that you know this gender group or this you know sexual preference group or this ethnic group it it then becomes your responsibility to be like okay hey you guys youre welcome to come on come to our meetings
to get motivated
yeh which is
not segregated
kind of onesided and it kinda sucks but I guess it just comes with thats just what happens when you decide to start that kind of group
Like the BSA for example
I think a lot of people have a problem with number one with the fact that its it is a black student association well if its black students that means they cant come
Well no its just the context in which a lot of African American students are very comfortable and they talk about issues that are important to them
uhhuh
that they may not may or may not be able to address during the day
but if you ever want anyone else to come then what do you d
Put up flyers
right
send out emails
right
blah blah blah you know no ones ever come and you know hey why dont you take us to BSA meeting
Umhmm
because I mean thats just I guess the exclusionary element of
segrated
yeh
yeh
Its the same thing with Foster because
yeah
I dont think that
I dont know what Foster is
Foster is forum on sexuality to encourage respect
Okay
And like I dont think that were at the point yet like at Rhodes where we can have a group just for gay people to talk about like what its like to be gay at Rhodes because I dont think there are enough people who are out and comfortable so the way that we make Foster like open for everyone is kind of a way of trying to get people to come in who arent so comfortable yet being
You know just saying hi Im gay and Id like to be in your club
You know but still at the same time like we have to be open we have to invite everyone you know and Im all for that
to make people feel comfortable
because you know if you say if you say well umm were gonna only to let gay people in like people always say well thats just like straight people saying gay people cant come
and
right
I understand that but at the same time there is something that is gonna separate you
and there is some uhyeh I mean that that but like there is something that I can get out of talking to other gay people at Rhodes
you know
who kind of understand like or who kind of are dealing with the same stuff you know and Im not saying that straight peoples or whatever peoples opinions arent as important as you know other gay peoples but you know sometimes I do just like talking to gay people about it
you kno
uhhmm
and then so its like
Its an opportunity for you to be able to be comfortable
Yeh
And so the question is does that ⁎needing⁎ that to be comfortable is that hindering your interaction with everybody els
well no because thats who you interact with all the time
You kno
yeh
Because this is set aside specifically ⁎for⁎ that
And its like all the other times in you know your daily experience you ⁎are⁎ talking to everyone you kno
and thats your time to be inclusive in you own group like so do you feel like its not hindering you because thats something that you set asid
Like I cant just walk into the into one of my classes
as an advantage not a not a disadvantage
right
And like I cant just walk into my classroom and say
hey yall I felt discriminated against because today because Im gay
You kno
yeh
Not everyone will understand that
I cant just bust out into like and kind of group of people
yeh
but I can talk to them about other stuff you know that doesnt have to do with that you know just like regular
football
right hhh
hhh you know something everybody is can is concerned with hhh and so you know but I can in the you know meetings that we have
Okay well I have a question
Okay
What about groups that are not based on umm racial differences gender differences lifestyle differences
like sororities
Like sororitiessssss
⁎I didnt say it⁎
yehh
⁎no no no I knew⁎
but what about
what you were talking about
yeh what about those things
Okay I dont really know exactly what my position is just because I feel like I dont know I dont feel like I have to defend it at all its just like it seems to me I do agree that sororities are definitely different than basing it an organization on like issues or needs err but its also a comfort zone you know
Like the reason that you would become involved in Greek life is because you know you need to find somewhere to fit
Like I know we were talking about this the other day
and you made a really good point that like that what people do to be able to get their groups and get their cliques and get their whatever and I think that sororities are just all about a comfort zone and I dont know what that hinders
I think sororities do hinder though a lot
Like I think Greek society I dont think its based like the way people perceive it I dont think its very good at all because it is very exclusive
You know and its not like
come join our club well let you be and we want to invite you dah dah dah dah
Its like people do get cut and people do get left out and people do get jossed around jostled around
Its just like thats why its different
well maybe because maybe independents have a and i dont want to speak for both of us or everybody but maybe I have such I dont want to say negative I have a standoffish
hmmhm
umm perception of sororities just because I ⁎dont⁎ know what qualifies
I dont know
uhhuh
if I would qualify
I dont
its like so mysterious you know its I I can only base I can only base the qualifications on physical appearance like what I see so okay
right
so there you know so if you run down the list of what a sorority girl ⁎is⁎ those are all things that Im not
So is that why Im not in it or
yehhh
you see what Im sayin
Like the eh my perceptions
yehh
thrown off cause I dont know what it takes
yeh cause they dont give off a very good because the only perception that youre getting is that they base everything on what you look like and a checklist of a b c d
yeh yeh
e f and g
so I dont know
I just I think that that its given a negative connotation just because so many people do join it do become involved in Greek life for the wrong reasons
Because they and like with ⁎you I see⁎ you as an independent I dont see it like I see a lot of people as needy at first like it I think it gradually becomes something different but in the beginning its its more of like an independence and dependence
well
and yeh and I see what youre saying because I think that a lot of it you know when I first got to Rhodes and I thought hhh
okay hhh
when I first okay when when I first got to Rhodes I was like sororities I cant believe anyone would join asorority thats so stupid thats so like just I mean how can you like say
were youre not cool enough to be in our club
you know how can you judge a person like tha
And ⁎then⁎ you know going through my years I started thinking about and somebody made pointed this out to me and said
how is an athletic team different than a sorority
and I started thinking about that and I was really Ive really been thinking about it for awhile and you know when it comesdown to it you know youre playing sports with people who you have something in common with
hmhum
you know like you have we all have volleyball in common you know its like thats what we do and we play volleyball and so thats how we got on this team you know and then and in you know a lot of ways the people that we spend this much time with become our friends its you know
right
we do make friends
because Right right thats how we were brought together
you know this way and I think and we have tryouts we cut people who arent good enough to be on the team you know because they cant do anything for our
we recruit
we recruit like because they cant you know people who dont have the talent to keep up with the team wont do anything for the team so you know we cut them
And sororities but for something I ⁎cannot⁎ figure out what it is to me thats different in cutting someone because theyre not Because their ⁎personality⁎ isnt good enough
Yeh
You know and I dont understand
Yeh cause its not based on skill its based on
But why is it different thoug
Again I I think and this is that I use this example as why Im not in a sorority
Well my problem is being affiliated with a group that I cannot ⁎actively constantly⁎ contribute to
The volleyball teams good and Im good
The volleyball team is bad and Im bad
umhm
umhm
If we suck I suck
umhm
yeh
If we had a good game I had a good game
umhm
Im constantly contributing
You know even if Im on the bench
umhm
just the fact that Im part of the team
umhm
theres some work some physical exertion some emotional you know some kind of investment Im making
Its not just the name of the team
Right
But if Im affiliated with a group thats beyond me which I feel I I mean Im not sure I neva been in somethin like that
Yeh
but it just seemed like youd be overwhelmed by the fact that once you get initiated you are you are that sorority
label
mhmm
and you cant and I dont I and I just dont know enough about it maybe but I you cant contribute to that
theres an institution ⁎already⁎ in place you know a profile already in place perceptions already in place and you just kind of go along
You buy the license plates you get the umbrella you get the tshirts the mugs and thats it thats who you are
You see what Im sayi
yeah I think thats who you are generally though and I mean I know were talking generally
Cause like Asako was like I cant come to work on Friday Im like
Yea just do it
Tomorrow Im gonna be spending so much money cause Im gonna be shooting
Youre doing wha
Shooting as in guns and I dont mean my arms
Wow
I know
Do you do that ofte
No its my first time with the Geeks with Guns
Ooohh
Ive always wanted to try it
Wonder what kind of guns youll shoot
I hope theyre not
Oh go to
hunter guns
Oh watch ok go to
I hope theyre really cool like Kill Bill no Kill Bill didnt have guns
No
Like Pulp Fiction
Yea but hold on dot gwg dot pgh dot com
Go to like click on gallery or something like that inside to your left
How much does this cos
It costs a lot of money like its sixty dollars and if I want to shoot extra
These are cool guns
I know I know
This one looks like a tommy gun you should get that one
Get in the first one and go to that videos
Ok I wanna do this one
its like oh my gosh its military style
Watch the video just look at how
Is the speaker o
Its so freakin loud
Let it load
Hi
Hi umm my card and my roommates card both stopped working in the door at the same time but I emailed maintence and they said that they think that my card is messed up so to come here and have it scanned
Okay
How about your roommate is he gonna come by to
Uhh I could I could tell him to umm I think its like something wrong with the lock
Yea thats actually possible
Yea did they stop working like at the same tim
Yea well like like about the same time like we like our cards stopped working and like the and like it would light up like red like I think it was just red
and then like and then they came in and like Id sent in a maintenance request and the guy came in to fix it and then like the next day it did the same thing again so he emailed me back and he was like since we already fixed it I think that the problems in your card
Thats a hot wallet
Oh yea
Oh my God is that duct tap
Yea I lost like I lost mine a while ago and then like I made this one while I was bored waiting to get another one and I just decided to keep it
I kind of think I should call Adria or like go down and be like
Ill call
Just go to New Card man
Oh I thought you had to look up the junk
What color was the ligh
What wha
What color was the light when you
Kind of sounds like the door
Was it solid re
Yea solid red
Its the card then
Would you show your car
Does it look oka
Yea it doesnt look bad
looks about like mine
Once before I lost my card and I had to get a new one and so they put on like the different
Is that the old one or the new on
Its just super odd that this stopped working
Seemed to
Ok itll work now
Thanks
Mm hmm
So what are you doing over Carniva
Everything

Uhhuh
I just cant wait
I think I deserve it
I wonder how its gonna be though because like unless you dont do like frat parties like all the frats are kind of not yea
Thats why Im not going
Im going everywhere else
I dont know Ive only heard of like one party so far but I know like as you go along like more and more will come up
Im sure like DU will have one and Phi Kap will probably have one but DUs in trouble
Really for wha
Some girl passed out on their lawn or something
and DTDs gone
I think Betas still okay
KapSig thats where Im going
Ive never been to KapSign
I hear its so much fun though
Theyre off campus yes
They got kicked off but I know where it is
Its on umm
do you know the CVS up on
Yes
That one its right across the street from there
Awesome
For real
I have a friend whos really good friends with KapSig guys
Ill be like
I really dont like a bunch of KapSig guys but
Reall
I have two friends in there who I love so you know so if theyre gonna be there I might as well go
I just wont let the other people love me
I only know one from high school
Hes really nice
Whats his nam
Joe Phillips
I dont know do you know Dan
Hmm mm
And do you know Matt Martunia
Hmm mm
So those are the two people that I love in KapSig
Theyre nuts to party with so
and then do you think people are gonna have house partie
I dont know I cant like I dont mind going to the frats at all
umhmm
but my friends do except for this one guy that I have who like loves me for it cause like Ill go with him cause its easier for him cause hes got a girl with him
mhmm
so like we always go together but the rest of my friends never wanna go
They do get like they do get old really quick
Oh I know but its not like I go over there all the time though
Yea
Seriously I havent been since like early October
Yea
Scratch that
I dont even I cant remember the last time Ive been there
Well I mean you cant expect much
It is gross
Yea
Its good fun once you get there
Yea
So yea Im gonna go all out
I got my wristband for the comedian
Uhhuh
Yea
Oh the Ray dude or what his name i
Ronnie Hay or Donnie Ray or something
Its the guy from Celebrity Fit Club
Yea yea yea I know maybe Im maybe Im like totally having his name wrong
I really really wanna see the Shins
Are they coming during Carniva
Thats what I thought ok
Uhh wristbands are coming out in April tomorrow
But I dont think you need it cause I checked the weather and it looks pretty fine
Like I looked up the weather for the thing just to make sure
I hope its nice cause so many more people will come
So far its pretty pretty good
Good
But yea umm I dont want no Pittsburgh weather
Last semester I remember it was the Friday morning
I had a shift Friday morning it was like
and like you know it didnt hit me til mid Carnival that I had to work tomorrow morning
I was like crap whatever
Was it too late by the
Oh my God it was soo
I wasnt even hung over I was drunk
And then like the thing is I had two shifts that Friday
I had the morning shift and I had classes in between then I had the afternoon shift but you know there were no classes
Right right right
Like when I sorted out the mail I was leaning on the wall
It was like so funny
And then like I tried to stay awake and finally my breaktime came before my next shift and it was like a nice day out and Im like I need some air I need to calm down
And then I went to and thats the only time I saw Buggy
So I was just like I have nothing to do all my friends are like
Yea thats true you would have been up
Thats the only reason I didnt go was because like I mean obviously the night before was like crazy but I wasnt getting up that early either way
Thats why you have days off
Yea but um so I none of my friends were on campus
They were all passed out at home so I was like what am I gonna do with two hours and I didnt feel like walking back
Right
So I just decided to stay on campus and I just like and I went to um I was like oh Buggys on today and a lot of people were there and then like a lot of people watching
I watched on tv on the Underground tv
Yea
But cause they were playing it nonstop yea
I really just dont care that much to like because I dont really like its more like a frat sorority kind of thing and I dont really like support or really love like any of them so I think when I watched like Pika took everything
Arent they really good at Bugg
Eh I guess so like I mean I just went there like and it was my first time seeing Buggy ever so I was like pretty cool I guess you know first time around and it was a nice day out so I just sat with the people beside me
I think Booth is cool though
Booth I like
I was really impressed with I think its KapSigs from last year the Sesame Street one
Yea
That was so impressive because it was weird because like the day like I hadnt been to the parking lot like for a while that whole time and I was like and I remembered what the theme was and I remember just walking towards the parking lot by myself and Im thinking thered better be Sesame Street on there and it was the first thing that I see
And Im like thats awesome
Their Big Bird was enormous
That was really impressive
I remember I thought one was really nice
I think it I dont think it was supposed to be Peter Pan maybe it was I dont know but it had like a tire swing and like a tree or something
Yea that was impressive too
And it had a treehouse
Yea that was that was really
I didnt go into that one for some reason but I was just like awesome
Its really fun I like Booth better than Buggy really
Im sure its a pain in the ass for the people making the booth though
Oh yea
Yea well I was gonna say theyve already started but that actually doesnt matter because they have so much work
Theyve done the frames I guess
Like I think everybody has done the frames
Yea
Thats like the main thing
I guess today is like move on to Morewood
Yesterda
Wha
Yesterday or toda
Today
Oh really its over in the parking lo
I dont know
Oh my gosh
It must get empty but they start it later they start it at like afternoon eveningish
Mm hmm
So they probably can wait til til people are gone
I wish uh
I wish Leith would do some drafting
why dont you guys help yourselves to a fine cookie while I catch up
ah indeed
yes yes get it out here
mmph
Ill wait
our partners saving me from beats nice
actually I just passed him that pack
meh Im in but
yeah Im doin crazy shit
what
oh
hey Sam are you getting yourself one
oh yeah
can you get me one
yeah
thanks
ooh looks good
looks hella good
ywant one Rod
hella dud
uh yeah
you guys are gonna have to share this plate
all right
sweet thank you
hah ok it wont be the first thing weve shared
Sams tender hole
I dont get at what you mean
scary talk
not a word
George you always ruin the fun
the funk
oh
Im gonna use this as a napkin
just the corner though
its not ok
Drews like property rights excuse me
uh hey thats mine
I take a card from the pack then I pass it to my right black
tough crowd in here
these are good
yeah
yeah nice job
what
oh that was to uh Sam
you just wanted to ask for
whatever
ooh thats a good idea
all right
sweet
sweet everybody gimme some
yum
hmm who got all these greasy spots all over the cards
thats been
is there any question
it wasnt Rod
everyone except me
oh yeah
Sam you might
Im not culpable these cookies are gulpable
I was wiping my hands on my pants after every
dick
mmm are really good
allow me to demonstrate
oh wait
nice
nice nice
heres my secret move
somehow this recording device encourages
ooh I almost got punched
I didnt realize that you had em I shouldve just laid em down gone bam
aw dude
theyre like wow goin like well its a macro so if you recorded for all time posterity
I know but I had trouble making your and hitting you
I had a bit of a little mad I think
only mad at yourself
shut up
whoah
bam crash slam bang
God this card taunts me
taunt taunt
you guys watch the Simpsons last night
no
for some reason the people of Shelbyville hoot
like monkeys
like what I was just doing
yes
Im gonna break this card
I dare you to break it
actually you can do that actually can rip a card
yeah right
uh huh
remember Osep did that
oh yeah
that guy who hated on him
ahh
what card did you rip
fuckin in the butt with the shit
what the fuck
I can never use this
no
oh no
I wouldnt even do anything about it
well no it was tainted it was sorely tainted already
you never said we couldnt curse you just said dont say anything sensitive
no
shhh
uh
I mean its totally fine like I just kinda wanted to use this as like a practice session
oh right
oh of course
at the least its an example of vulgar language usage
oh
sounded like it hurts
damn this is kind of bonkers
whoah
so whats the deal like that with team drafting like that you dont want certain things to get into other peoples hands i dunno
hmm
I uhh I dunno
you need to know what the other people are in for that to work
yeah
yeah its really hard to judge
hmm
I mean the priority is always getting the quality in your hand
now we know what crazy tricks people will be throwing
works for me
oh God
yeah this is a bit nutty
Christ
ok
God damn it
thats ridiculous
these packs are always so stupid
the Betrayers is weird could be a real toss up you know
yeah
go either way
ooh shit
what
does that mean another batch is done
no that was just the five minute warning
off whos in that five color deck
hehts like ha ha
passing
yah
damn
rough roughy rough
George dyou mind if I read that
I feel like in some ways it would almost be easier to do a draft if you got to open the Betrayers first
yeah
well thats a big part of it I think is trying to set yourself up for Betrayers pack you know
could I see that plate Drew
what
what
I havent had a cookie yet
dammit
thawas nice to ask for the plate
yeah
yeah
I thought about it for a long time
yeah I almost did it to be safe
you mightve yknow if you did ask him I bet it wouldve been better if you said you should put that plate over here
yeah
I dunno Drew responded to command but like sounded like there was something wrong with it being there he might be like oh
I dunno but
yeah
I couldve gone like whoah you should put that plate over here
kicked it under the table
or like
if you were just to be like hey Drew gimme that plate
so you guys both think it wouldve been better to just say than ask
yeah
cuz I think ask considers that you might be doing something for them
this isnt the last cookie is it
no
no
no theres a whole nother batch
were just discussing the
how to bend others to our will
yeah
it would prolly be even better to do it while like when hes just picked up a new pack and hes really interested in what cards are there
right
mm hmm
thats true
this is fucking craziness
love that guy
youre gonna put that finger on the cards now right
well I got a napkin
huh ok
just checking to see
Rod san
what
yeah Im not passing this to im sorry
oh never mind sorry
yeah
doing a quick little check
I guess youre just all slow
oh
oh
ooh got us there
Okay
so um
Theres like other stuff that like Kushtrim like said
Oh ye
Last night
But
Um
Like
I dont know
hes the strangest guy like he was like he was like um
I dont know why but I feel I might be attracted to older women
Oh Reall
Yea and I was like
Okay um Im sorry to hear tha
I mean like
Like I dont know but um
Are you older than hi
No
But
he doesnt really like was I hes so strange because like he acts like he was like attracted obviously to me
Right
And then hell say hell be like like
That woman over there she must like shes probably as old as my mother but I cant help it im attracted to her
Out of nowhere he just says tha
Yeah
Wow
And I was like
Why dont you just go up to he
And then hes like
No no no that would be rude for you
If you had two other friends then maybe like I would say excuse me I need to go And ugh I dont know
huh wheres he from agai
Kosovo
Maybe things are different there
A little bit haha
yea you know he comes across kind of normal too the first time
Kind of norma
Well the first time I met him he was like normal
No I think so like I dont know where it comes from because like
he acts like
he acts very like
He acts very respectable in front of other people and like
I feel like
Do I just bring out the worst of people or somethin
No Its just that like
With all the stuff that hes saying theres no way you could bring that out
haha I dont know its just uh I guess its just the way he is It just doesnt come out that way unless hes around certain people
I mean like Zander like
Oh yeah
Naw but I mean you didnt bring that out
Thats very hard it was already there
maybe its just
Maybe its a European thing
Well wheres Zander wheres zander fro
Well from America
But he was in Europe so he gets
Yea hehehe
Oh ok
Somehow by like diffusion
Daha
I dont know if thats how it works but yea I I think that they are similar in a lot of ways
mmhmm
yea
I think that theyre similar and that
why
and you should stop hanging out with them
I dont think so no but
hhmhhmm
You cant just cut off a tie with a person like that I mean
Whens the last time you talked to zande
Okay thats a different scenario
yea
Well that was very much a mutual thing like if this was with like Kustrim I would be like go
I just dont like uh like what hes trying to do
I question like his intentions
His motives
Cause like is he really your friend or is he trying to get in your pant
I just uh it just seems a little odd
I mean most friends dont act like that
Maybe Kushtrim doesnt know how to be friends to a girl
mmnnn
But like what am I supposed to do with tha
Like you cant just be like
You dont know how to be a friend
I cant
yea well maybe when he says something thats inappropriate for friends to say to one another like uh
I want to sleep with you
or
are you good in be
or something like that then Id say its uh you know it seems like that you should stop him and tell him
Kushtrim thats not something one friend would say to another friend
Maybe not like that but something similar
I dont think friends should mnnnmnhhh
Hes just uh Id say comes off as a different guy than he actually is
Well thats cuz youre a guy
Thats true
So when he met you he treats you like he probably would treat friends
How many times have you hung out with him when it was just like you guy
You and Kushtrim
Like this semeste
No till now
I dont know
Fou
Not a lot
More than fiv
I would say about five
About fiv
Okay
But then I think theres been an equal amount where I I spent with him and with like SureThing or him and Cori and somebody else or like him and just a couple other people kind of thing
Ok
Well when you guys are alone has it always been wierd or have you ever felt like
that time he tried to kiss you that count as on
No it doesnt actually
Okay
Are you okay about tha
I didnt say anything
Well if thats when it was wierd then
No I dont I didnt feel
I feel like since I came back from Spain like its become like full force like
mmm
Like do you know the first thing that Kushtrim said to me was um well obviously like hi and like all that but like the first like ligitimate comment he gave me was like like
Europes made me like like so much more beautiful
or something like that like since I came back
hmmm
and I was like oh thanks Kushtrim I missed you
But it was still awkward
Its better than taking that approach he took last night
to get in your pants
Well he did have a girlfriend didnt h
Yea maybe thats why it helped to keep him full
because he had her to focus on
I think that he needs someone
He claims he doesnt though
Yea well nobodys going to claim that they need someone
Why would want to need someone
I think he would say
That you need someon
Yea
Kushtrim yea he would be like
Man Im craving someone
like
i mean I know hes up front but thats kinda like
a knock against his like I dont know his manhood like his individuality like
he needs someone like hes like he needs to be dependent on someone
he feels alone and he cant handle himself he has to have a gir
I mean i dont know what a relationship does to him so
Im uncertain although it really might really help him out i mean theres all kinds of people
Thats it how long had he been going out with he
I think it was a couple months im sure
Is that longer than you picture
Wha
Shorter than you would think or Longe
What do you think with Kushtri
Well like Kushtrim talks a lot about like marriage and stuff like he feels like hes at the age that hes seeking marriage
So Ive told you about this stuff righ
Yea I think so
Briefly
How old is h
I think twenty four
Uh huh
And like I understand where hes coming from but I dont know
What do you fee
Like maybe he feels that his clocks ticking
Yea
He needs to find someone
Spread the seed like evolutionary psych
Oh God
Oh Crap
the way
I do think were are trying to figure out the main reason I do think he did really rape her I dont feel like there is any legit reason she would make a statement like that
I dont see anything in it for her thats the only thing
I mean dont most strippers want attention
wouldnt be a stripper if you didnt want attention
Supposedly stripers have low self esteem so yes they do want attention
I know but thats you cant say there are those who they dont have a high education and they have to strip to
like eat you know what Im saying that could be a very possibility
she does not necessarily want attention
She is not going to get money these kids in college
he necessarily didnt rape her
Wha
You are saying necessary
the thing is like even though even thought theres nothing in it for her some people get accused of things their faults for no reason
Just cu
like maybe maybe the guy pissed her off maybe the guy didnt tip her enough ya know maybe thats why she decided to make a big deal of it
maybe he offended her maybe he called her a whore or something
thats the thing though
thats considered sexual harassment he could get arrested for that
well then well maybe like ya know this girl without a college education supposedly doesnt know this and thought that she was raped
well thats true its possible I dunno
You think people should get uh sexually uh charged get sexually charged sexual harassment for saying a name like that
I mean I dunno just like I dont get offended when some says that doesnt like mean that whatever
not like whatever I mean Id get offend but like but just because I wouldnt get offended
Yeah there is like paint all over me
what were you paintin
I was painting some plywood
You should help paint the fence tonight
I told Dorian that you guys should do a little tridelt shout out but he was like no
Tri delt shout ou
what are we gunna sa
we love tri del
would you guys shout out Pik
We would do a we would do a Pika shout out
you would do a Pika shout ou
Yeah
are you going to do a Pika shout ou
if we get the fence who is getting the fence
maybe well hand it off to you
We can hand it off to whoever we want
We can hand it off to you
We have a lot of power right now fence power
So anyway Back to Duke Back to Duke hum do you kno
has been criminally charge
has he been arraigne
Uhmmm
I dont think so
dont think hes been
I mean he probably gunna end up in court
I mean it just it doesnt I dont Im pretty sure he hasnt been criminally charged it kinda confuses me
Thats the thing thought they cant cater to the
I mean he would probably have to agree to get kicked out of school like if that was like for his safety it the only way
you can just kick someone out of school
Thats why thats how thats why for that party I sue the person who
I mean if I got accused of that yeah I would probably leave school too cuz I wouldnt want anybody hurting me
But I dunno
There are people out there who want to kill him
to kill the kid its just not safe for him
yeah A lot of feminists want to kill him
But so like I dunno
If he is innocent why doesnt he go to cour
why has he gone to court if he has been criminally charge
I am saying since he hasnt been criminally changed
Why are you talking about the Duke Thin
you know we are being taped
Well I wasnt sure I thought you guys were just
Why are you taping thi
kayhan
kayhan Its for a class language and thought
kayhan has a project kayhan
we record a conversation for studying language and uh kayhan Transcribing the conversation
So yeah so we were
We are talking about the duke thing thats the topic of the conversation
you have to talk about it for forty minutes
Thirty minutes we are almost done cuz we already had a conversation before this
plus its an interesting topic
Like
I dunno you think that a girl do you think that the girl will file civil charges in hopes of you know mone
I mean its pretty crazy
Cuz he can be tried both ways he can tried criminally and civilly
But I dont think he has been criminally charged which I think that if not criminally charged winning a civil case is more difficult because the judge of the civil case is gunna wonder why he hasnt been criminally charged as far as there isnt enough evidence to criminally prove him guilty so what makes him feel like he has enough evidence to civilly prove him guilty
so I dont he his gunna end up having to really pay anything for this
So what happens in in cases like this like when its just guys word against a girls but there is like no witnesses and no evidence
I mean
Im not sure if there are witnesses or not there were other guys that were involved
it says here there is actually
They took DNA tests from the girl they dont have results yet but the duke lacrosse attorney actually stepped up and it says that they uh represents team co captain the women fabricated her story and has gotten in over her head with the story she is telling
like thats the word of a lawyer I mean
he has to say that he is in the defense of the duke dude
well they say that the there is photos that show the women attempting to reenter the house with a big smile on her face
I mean But how do they know that how is she attempting to renter the house how is that not the same time
I think I think that you can get raped and still try and enter a house with a smile on your face like Ive been raped before
Really
and Im alright yeah see the thing is like a women gets raped they finally goes in shock for a while I dunno it just depends
Its different with tragic experiences so I dont think entering a house is evidence of her not getting raped
thats true
She doesnt have much credibility I mean she and she has just because there is like probably not very well educated
Being not educated makes you not credibl
I mean a court of law yeah
like I mean I am not saying its right
but the jury is not really take like if she had a PHD
This actually they actually say that she said she said she was subjected to racial slurs by three men she was dragged into a bathroom raped multiple times beat choked her
Thats what she sai
Thats what the twenty seven old oh student at near by north Carolina century university
So she is a college student
She is a stripper
Ok
So I mean but thats another thing three guys on the lacrosse team and those three guys did it and thats what they are saying
thats what she is saying
Right
the whole team is getting suspended
so if they are denying it they are going to have those three denying it so I mean
there is actually attorney involved and there is criminal charges
So I dunno
its gunna be tough the DNA test it gunna really
Sometimes you rely on DNA but then they are gunna If it comes back when they find DNA on her He can always say its consensual
they are also being charged for its says uhh
but he hasnt yet said its is consensua
I dont I dont really know what he said
if he said it was conceptual or if he said it was consensual
I am not sure of that
do you know tha
if he claimed
I dont if he talked yet
I dont think he said anything yet but hush they also said that uh two black women outside that they were screaming racial slurs at her
thats another they are getting charged for
Yeah two women were
so like I dunno were they like I dunno did they say so it doesnt hold up in court
yeah
Im sure his lawyer is advising not to speak just because wait for DNA tests cuz if he really wants to get off for this he is gunna have like if it comes up with his DNA on her he is gunna have to say its consensual so like I dunno
He knows he knows
So do you like California in genera
I dont know it would have been better without the whole driving to San Francisco and back because the road was like this really curvy and I couldnt take it I needed to be sick the whole time
Did you actually thoug
No but I was close the whole time so it was unpleasant
Ok and then then you got to San Francisco and you hung ou
Uh huh with that Katya girl and then one day she didnt go anywhere with us but one day we took her grandmas friend Mila who was visiting from Russia to some park downtown or something and we walked around the little fake duck pond and stuff
I dont know I guess it was interesting for her but wed already seen all the pretty hikes so we were like ehh this is nice
I see And then so then you drove bac
Then we drove back on one day
It was long
And then we got back and oh oh oh ok Mom got a hotel on priceline and it was supposed to be some very nice hotel she got it really cheap but we were afraid that theyd only have one bed in the room
But we got there there was two beds everything was really nice and Mom walks into the hotel in her dirty sneakers and jeans and not washed from like hiking
And its this really nice hotel and everyone was looking at her really really weirdly
And so we checked in and whatever and we get in there and the room was so nice it was ridiculous
When I went to New York also for my interview also they all looked at me like what the hell are you doing here
A bunch of like official business people with their official business things and then some schmucky teenager
I walked in at night you know late
Yeah thats what we did too
But its nice when you get to stay at a nice hotel
Yeah except I dont know it was decorated I supposed it was supposed to be fashionable or whatever but to me it was just really ugly
like lots of bright colors that clashed
Maybe its just left over from the eighties
Maybe
No the hotel where I was it was really nice and they had really good breakfast cause it was all official business people you know on Wall Street and they had everything you want made to order you could tell them what you want in your omelet and they had every kind of food fruit pastries whatever
Our breakfast wasnt included and it was twelve dollars so we were like no
Thats typical our style see its nice when the company paid for me
Thats nice
I was like yeah whatever
And then the hotel made a mistake and charged my credit card for it instead of Merrill Lynchs and I was like Jesus Christ three hundred fifty one dollars for one night in a hotel aaah
So I called them and Im like guys guys this is not normal and they fixed it
Thatd be hilarious
Yeah I was getting a little nervous
What was I going to sa
Um no the hotel
My favorite part I think was there was this little rubix cube in the room and there was a little card that said
do you think you can make this rubix cube
If you can bring it down to the bar and the bartender will give you a free drink
Or you can take it home and well just add fifteen dollars to your room bill
And I was like thats a lot for a rubix cube
Yeah
It was really random too
So did you make it and get a free drin
You should have
Mom was really tempted to
Mom was looking at it and she was like
hmmm
You should have made it and gotten one of them a free drink
You know there are people who actually have formula
Like Bor has this really nerdy friend who knows how to make it
Hes like ok so then I turn it one half turn to the right and then I turn this other part
He has this whole like formula and he can make any rubix cube behind his back at any time
Were not cool enough for that we couldnt figure it out
Yeah thats pretty cool let me tell ya
Uh huh
Um Yeah
What else happene
Oh the Bat Mitzvah
The Bat Mitzvah was probably the best one Ive ever been to
Wh
Minus the fact that I didnt really have anyone I knew there
Cause shes cool and then most of her friends are cool
Except for some who are kind of annoying but whatever
And then the music was the best Ive ever heard at any BarBatMitzvah whatever
Cause usually they play rap and I dont like rap
But they played two Beatles songs and they played just in general stuff that I liked mostly
And then there was like requests and
Well you can tell them like what you want them to play
So maybe your friends just tell them to play rap
Probably but I dont know
So did you request anythin
Um I asked if they had anything by Beck because Id showed Rebecca the Bat Mitzvah girl Beck and she wanted to hear some more and they didnt have anything
They only had popular stuff or stuff thats been around like Build me up buttercup
I see So you had fun did mom and dad get drun
Not really surprisingly not
Because we had to go on a plane right after that so
Right after tha
In the evening you went right on the plan
We left the Bat Mitzvah Oh wait
One of her friends obviously wanted her
But she was denying it
It was really funny
He was like this little chubby kid and he was really nice I liked him
But he was kind of antisocial and refused to dance and just hung out with her the whole time
And they obviously wanted each other
They wanted each other or he just wanted he
I dunno she seemed to like him a lot like as friends but I dunno
Friend zone
Yeah but it was cute
It was funny
Me and all her friends decided that it needed to happen
So you made friends with her friends to
Some of them yeah
It was interesting
I was like guys Im gonna dance cause Im not gonna ever see any of you again
because I dont normally dance
Thats awesome
Cause thats when you have a good time you know
Exactly
Im not gonna see them in California ever again
Yeah
So why not
And then um then right after the Bat Mitzvah we went to the airport
But before we got there there was ridiculous traffic
It took us like three hours instead of like one so it was kind of bad we were afraid we were going to be late
But then we found the rental car and returned everything and we were like barely there
But then we had a little time so me and mom were like you know what were hungry
Lets go get some food
So we went and there was really nothing besides McDonalds and so we got those nasty chicken sandwiches aand the plane ride after that I like could not live I felt so bad
Wait why because it was turbulence
Well there was turbulence but just in general McDonalds always makes me sick
Plus turbulence equals bad
And there was a baby right next to us and it was loud
But the first
Wait how long is the fligh
No no no the first flight was only an hour so I
To wher
To Las Vegas
So I lived through it but then we walked through the airport and it was smoke and it reminded me of last time we went to Las Vegas when I had the stomach flu and I felt awful the whole time
But whatever then we got on the plane
I member every time we went into a casino mom would be like lets go look at this beautiful casino
and you would be like bleh
Yeah and then um we got on the plane on the way there we had to do some underground tram and it was complicated and on this tram there was this lady and she had two cats in like bags and we were like ok and then we get on the plane and this same lady goes right behind us with her cats
And they meow
Yeah the whole time
The cat was under my seat and I couldnt take it I felt so bad for it
It was meowing like someone was killing it the whole time
Poor furry
I know
How can you do that to a ca
It was a four hour flight
Well if it has to get somewhere maybe shes going somewhere you kno
Maybe but I felt soo bad for it and I like couldnt sleep cause the cat and this was like three oclock in morning and the cats under me meowing
It was really depressing
Plus I felt really sick still cause there was lots of turbulence so it was just not a good plane ride back at all
Well then you got home and you went to bed and now mom and dad have to drive me back to Pittsburgh
Exactly
I wanted to take the car but they would not let me
I know Im sorry
I tasted the freedom of having a car in Pittsburgh
I was the one who accidentally gave them the idea that the Nissan would get there and maybe drive around and then itd die
Damnit
Sorry
Ok its going to die eventually anyway
I know
I was excited it was really fun to have a car cause I could drive places and enjoy life
Thats generally what you do with a car drive places
So my friends coming to um on Thursday
To for carniva
I told you righ
Yeah
um Alex
Wait this Thursday next Thursda

Or like the summer befor
The summer before my senior year
So I havent seen him since then
so
and hes your best frien
No well hes one of my best guy friends because I went to an all girls school
thats true
you know
and we talked to each other online and stuff like hed call me
He wanted to come visit me in DC
But like that didnt really work out
And my parents and stuff like I dont know they were like against males or something
Right
Yeah but yeah so Im really excited to see him I havent seen him in almost two years
Oh wow
Isnt that crazy yeah so I met him
So you said he is still in high school righ
Hes a junior yeah
So how is he coming her
Oh his dad
Oh okay
Like he wants to visit this school because he is pretty interested in CMU
Thats why you should stay here
I dont know how thats going to work out
But he lives in Michigan yeah isnt it really strang
arent you fro
I know Im from Northern Virginia
I live near DC and um so the summer program was at this private school called Cidwell
and there was there was just like just a ton of classes you could take and I think I was taking some study skills something while taking
How did that work out for yo
in the long run
It was so stupid I didnt learn anything
And how are your study skills no
Very very bad as you can tell I procrastinate to the max
So do I as you can tell
Time management skills they dont exist anyway
Basically the study skills class was so dumb there was like three kids in it
and um but I was doing that because well in the morning but then I would have SAT class
In the afternoon because I took the SATS again in probably November of my senior year
He was taking some writing classes and stuff apparently his aunt his okay I remember
His aunt lived like near DC
Okay so he was visitin
Well he stayed there for the whole summer for the summer program
Like he comes to DC a lot last summer he went to this like this precollege thing precollege program at Georgetown
He loved it he actually lived in like Georgetown dorms and stuff
and uh yeah but he is from Michigan his brother and sister I think go to UMich
you kno
yeah University of Michiga
I dont think he wants to go there and like this kid
So he wants to come her
I think well he is looking at it
Hes a really smart kid he goes to a Catholic allboys school
So hes like the male version of yo
Not really hes not as crazy as me
Im sure hes not that crazy hes like and its so funny because hes Korean right but all
He told me he has like maximum four asian friends
Like hes a super twinkie hes even more of a twinkie than me pretty hard to believe righ
Does he speak Korea
I dont think his Korean is that great
Like I think he knows some Korean but hes like amazing at hes amazing at guitar he plays electric guitar by ear
Can he read music
I think so too
I think he can general like yeah tabs and stuff
I think he can actually read some music cause he plays a lot of instruments
Lets see what else he sort of tried to start a band but it didnt really work out but
Like he he sends me his music he loves The Strokes so he plays
I dont know who they
aw man they are an awesome band like sort of modern day rock
You know how many English bands I know
Yeah you really dont listen to English music
I have some
Yeah I know but anyway but he listens to yeah The Strokes and he
Actually like he uses this program on his computer where he does drums and he also does you know his own electric guitar and puts it together makes the song together
Its all him like its amazing
Does he play anything else or just guita
Guitar and drums
He has a drumset I think he plays from keyboard and what not
Like piano and stuff like that like hes so musical
Kinda like Dere
kinda like Derek but hes so different that you know like I dont know
Derek is from Hong Kong and hes very sarcastic
Alex can be sarcastic but I dont know
Wait why do you think its weird that I havent seen him for two years and hes my best frien
That is kinda weird hu
yes it is
No but we talk on AIM all the time like we call each other sometimes
Its because I dont have that many like guy friends righ
I went to an all girls school
You do here though dont yo
here I do
But close guy friend
I dont have that many I think
Like how man
Most of my friends here that are really close to me are girls
They are the girls on my floor the girls from ARCC
Yeah like Im not best friends with Bo or like
Well you dont like Bo
I know
I know but like I try to be nice to him
well what about Eri
were not best friends no way
well but youre pretty close arent yo
I dont think we are that close hes kind of guarded so I dont know that much about him
Yeah he is
Like we are pretty good friends Id say
But I used to be really good friends with Leon
Then we had like a falling out
You probably dont him hes a freshman bio major
From like Boston area
Nope
Yeah we spent way too much time together
I thought he was a nice guy until I got to know him
He became very very annoying and super anal about grades and we had a stupid fight about it
We had a falling out basically and I dont really talk to him
You dont really see him anymor
Hes in my chem class thats about it this semester but I really dont talk to him anymore
But then I started hanging out with Eric Teng a lot
Do you know Eric Ten
Okay
Hes the IM coordinator for ASA
Hes also a freshman chem major
I dont really know that many ASA people
Its so funny how I know him because I did meet him during orientation but the thing is that
We found out that one of my Korean friends from Madiera used to go out with him
How crazy is that and she is a sophomore shes like twenty
Hes like eighteen but anyway the thing is
Like Theresa and Bo
The funny thing is she didnt know like she didnt even know he was
Oh reall
Like Theresa and Bo
At least they know how old they are though
she kinda went out with him for like it was like a very short fling and basically no offense to him but she kinda used him to get back with this other guy
yeah Ricardo so
Ricardo
Ricardo you dont know him
there is no Ricardo here
oh no no no no no they met each other at Brown precollege
oh at
At like Brown University and um yeah so they had some drama
But yeah shes a sophomore here actually
Its so funny
But yeah her exboyfriend is a freshman here too
Yeah but now like I dont really see him anymore and like he got annoying too I dont know what it is
Maybe I get sick of people easily
Am I annoyin
No
I usually dont get sick of people that easily but I guess I get you know I get bored fast I have like ADD
You have a short attention span
Thats true but when it comes to close friends you know usually I keep them you know close to me
but theres just something
I think I am finding more and more the closer I get to these guys the more annoying they become
Or I find their true personality or I really get to know them and they become really annoying or something
Thats true of most people like when I first met Andy I thought he was a really nice guy and everything
Now I still think he is a good guy but every so often like with Ruby
Like Eric I still think he is a nice guy he just gets annoying because hes kind of like Chang he talks a lot
About nothingness literal nothingness
and and like recently hes been like apparently hes a brother of AKPsi
and then so hes really secretive about it even though I can see the pin that he is wearing all the time
and he he just tends to be very secretive about things now its very strange to me
I never saw him as a super secretive person hes the one who has all the korean drama
He has it on his computer and hed show me My Sassy Girl and wed watch it
Another guy that watched Korean Drama
Yeah
He watches Chinese Korean Drama everything
Japanese too maybe the girl from sixth floor and him and me wed all watch movies together
but now well maybe its just like we all dont have time anymore but still
like like I used to eat lunch with him all the time and like its just weird now
Its not weird we are still friends but he became very secretive and kind of annoying in that sense
like because ts annoying that he doesnt tell me things or hell be a compulsive liar I cant stand it anymore
I dont know whats wrong with me
Why do you think its something wrong with you
No whats wrong with me
Like not havin
Not having close guy friends no I mean for example Alex is a guy I really consider him one of my closest guy friends
Wh
Alex
Oh your friend
For a second I thought you meant Alex Alans roommate
Next Thursday Alex is coming
But the thing is I havent seen him in two years
How are you with the other ARCC board guys like Bosco Alan
Were not close were not that close thats the thing we are just friends
I dont consider us really close friends
So like Hakeem right
Wh
Oh you dont know him
Sorry you dont know him I met him the summer after eighth grade
I met him the summer after eighth grade at have you heard of John Hopkins CTY progra
Center for Talented Youth
Center for Talented Youth Its sort of a nerd summer program
I went to that at a college in Maryland
I met Hakeem weve been friends since then hes one of the few people I kept in contact with
From summer hes also one of my best guy friends
Hes a freshman at Dartmouth
Really really smart but in high school hed come over to see my place and stuff well I wasnt in the place but my friends were

Maggies the best one
Maggie does this I rarely burp
She was doing it all over I rarely do that

Tiffany we should both marry Fritz and then he can cook for us
His dad makes a lot of money
Yeah his dad is really rich too well wait till he gets really old and then we can marry him

Its really not its just because because
Its ok
I wouldve laughed at it too but I had to wait until Tiffany got home
Wh
I think that Im gonna move
No its because Tyler got his hair cut and it was
It looked the same
really bad
No it wasnt
I just made that up I dont know
Mom youre takin some abuse
Tiffany started it
Guess what thoug
I can issue some abuse too if they dont stop
Nothing
You know Im going to seem so normal when yall go to that SAT class and see that guy
And he has the same hair cut too
Hes got the same hair cu
Yes
He doesnt
Well see
Thats such a mean thing to say
So what youre saying is I shouldnt go and have my hair cut by a woman whose hair is only an inch long everywhere
Yes
Everythings hard
I cant keep from laughing
Its ok Ill live
Its ok when your hair gets rolled itll look nicer
Enough hair dissing ok
Its ok once you once you get it changed itll look a little bit better
Yeah as soon
Once you fix it
as it like grows out and go to someone else and have it fixed
Once you get your next
Actually its not
It cant be any worse than when I was engaged and went to get my hair permed so it would look all cute and they fried it off at my scalp
And then had to cut my really really long beautiful layered hair to what was really really short and then some of the stubby part like took years to grow out
I mean really everytime where the rod touched my head it fried it off and it was like less than it was not measureable you had to have calibers to measure it
It was awful
Did you really measure it with caliber
I didnt own any calibers but I knew that thats what it took
Just wondering how you knew that because I dont think I wouldve been
But Ive used them so Im aware of their abilities
Of the abilitie
Kent
Yes
Could you do somethin that will shift the focu
To you or somethin
I could burp
Well pass on that
People in school burp a lot I mean like like to burp loud
Yeah
What did you sa
She said some people at school burp a lot
For some people thats their only thing they can do at school
Brian burps a lot I mean
Like Holl
Like Holly
Ew
And Elisha
And Kit not really
0
Uhoh I burnt the meat
You burnt the plan
Just slightly
Your things rocking on the burner
It happens Its happened
Nothings been caught fire were fine
Thats good
So how was your visi
Oh we had dinner with this this family with this kid
Hes like in first grade or kindergarten
But he was so funny like he talked nonstop like the whole time he just talked and talked and talked
And like um he was like he was always trying to find the cats
but they were really scared of him
but then he was like he he found the mouse like that or something and he was like
Ok Im going to give it to the cat because he likes it
and then he went and gave it to the cat and then he just left and he was like
yeah the cat if the cat doesnt like me Im not gonna stay around him
or something I dont really remember what he said but it was really funny
Thats not a good way to end a long story
To get to the last part and say I dont remember what he said
I cant tell it
I cant tell the story I mean someone else should tell the story
Theres a little glitch in that one because nobody else was there
drama and like voice majors will sing anywhere they are cuz
thats like them getting their practice in
which I think is kind of bothersome
I dont think that makes them that great though necessarily
I think a lot of them learn theory
but I think theres still a lot of variation in their skills
Im not saying like Im not
its not just me though but when Im singing
where Im just kind of mumbling
Oh I see I see
Thats just kind of weird
You walk by a person like that
You have no idea hahaha
I see
Because the earphones are up
Is a dead giveaway though Im talking about people without earphones
Im kinda of like what are they doin
I think its like in
Okay
Broadways
Where they are fighting over everything suddenly they start singing
Haha except lifes not a musical
Hahaha
No I mean
Life the musical now hit show on broadway
Youre going to write a playwrite arent you
I know it and Im going to be like damn it rob this was my idea and my title I get ownership rights
This is copyrighted were on record this will be our evidence
If this is copyrighted I want mine
It was your idea
I watched phantom of the opera the other day
Oh how was i
I wasnt really watching it
Okay
I have the dvd at home
I have never seen it on broadway
Which is kind of sad
well my roommates were watching it
at my place and I was kinda watching
Okay
on and off and I really didnt
want to watch the ending
I really wanted to see it on broadway
Right arent
they touring it here or somethin
I thought they were
Yeah I dont know
I should know but
I also
want to see Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
I know its a play
by shakespear
No no no no no
Its a play off of
the two characters from hamlet
that is written by shakespear sorry
thats what I meant
and its the two guides
Two guards
two guards
Maybe we could analyze
the word modules
Hahahaha
This is Yoonie not getting enough caffein
I have plenty
It just means Im not getting enough sleep
But anyway so
Is it a musical too I thought it was a movie
its a play
A play or whatever
Its nothing like shakespear
right
Its um
Isnt it british dry humor thoug
um a bit
theres a lot of logic and rhetoric
oh ok
Its like play on words
Yeah and
the logical fallacies
I mean these two people
like its its
its talking about how
hamlet and these two guards
are sent off to do something
and then
sent off to watch over hamlet because
You know hamlets father was
Yeah Hamlets uncle was like
watch out for hamlet because hes gone crazy
so yeah
theyre sent to spy on him
Yeah well
part of the spying process was
hi could you please send
hamlet to his death
hmm
and
hamlet turned the tables on them
remember when
uh
I dont remember that line
I dont remember that line either
I dont remember that line of hi could you send him to his death
um
they send
Hamlet to a foreign kingdom
with a note
with rosencrantz and guildenstern
ohhh
Hi this guy
we dont need anymore please kill him
something like that
but um
I remember that scene now
Hamlet finds the letter
and changes it around
so it says hi would you kill these two guards
so the
rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
the play talk about this whole
life they wake up and
they are extras in a play
they dont have anything to do until
well when they
when their scene comes on
theyre just sitting around
and
they do what theyre told to do
um hmm
they go there and they
its its really
really interesting
I have the play at home
okay
I dont know if you want to read it or not
You have to some time
Okay
Okay
Okay
sounds good
My favorite play was
um the something of being earnest
the importance
the importance of being earnest thank you
that was funny because
it was play on words
its pretty funny
I read that play for
english class in high school
do you like play on word
Umm
I can appreciate it
I dont know if Id necessarily go
out and seek it
but I can appreciate it
have you ever seen a movie
called his girl friday
No
Its black and white
its
back when they
started the style of
um conversations
that were very very fast
and theres bantering between
the two main characters
and everybody else in it
its a really good movie
its actually on the top
movies on IMDB
okay
I dunno I dont
remember
but its a really good movie
sounds good
His Girl Frida
They made
a remake
Dont watch the remake
okay
I think the remake actually has
Christopher Reeves
hmm
yeah
So this is a horrible question
for me to be asking
it reflects how much of current affairs
I dont know
but is christopher reeves still aliv
No
Ok thats what I thought
He was in bed
um and
developed something else
and wasnt able to
I forget
But I dont really consider that
current events
I mean
its not
its not world affairs
haha thats true
well
I guess so
um
its funny though when I think of superman
I dont think of christopher reeves
anymore oh are you okay oh my god dont choke
but I think of Dean Cain
oh god
as the new superman
you watch that one
Yeah I used to
Do you watch Do you watch smallville
No
No oh okay I dont watch it either
I watch a little bit I mean if its on
Ill watch it
for fun but its
ehhh whatever I
Im always like
you watch everything
yeah I do
Its funny
cuz I really dont watch tv
but then again
I pretty much know
everything
you dont watch things religiously but if its on
and if I have nothing to do
I may watch it
if I find it entertaining if I have nothing better to do
I may
Theres always something better to do
Cook
okay I guess I could do that
some day well go to the strip district
and get
Not here
I do more of that when Im home
oh at home oh okay
Home where my friends are at college
or working
when Im home for break usually
our breaks dont match up too
and then like
you know
whenever Im at home if its hard for me to explain
I guess being an only child kind of goes
into it
Im just like I dont like
being around people
too much like I can
do it I like
it I like it
but not always
every
time
thing
so like I like
maybe I should just rephrase
to be like actually
I just like it when
I can just sit there and
have nothing to worry about nothing pressing to do
and I dont want to do anything else
but watch tv
and then I will enjoy
my
episode of smallville
or you know
superman or whatever
thats an interesting revelation
for a ca
that you dont like to be around people
I dont mean it that I dont like to be around
people cuz I am
a people person you know how I am around people
Im totally outgoing
but every so often I like
to be a couch potato
and just be
worthless
for about an hour
thats what I like to do exactly
so you know
like last night theres absolutely nothing
getting done
oh ok you just sat and breathed
Yeah sat
and breathed ate cheesecake
Holy crap thats a lot of duct tape
wha
We got bored
Holy crap
you got bored
I can see that
Naptime for everyone
Hey
no
If I wasnt scared of heights Id be like grossly up there
Id proly roll off
yeah me too
cause Ill just fall asleep an to the sleep area or where everyone meets
I think I may go curl up on the other side of the shell
awwww
Didnt anybody get any sleep last night
I got like three hours
I got like three and a half hours
Actually my problem right now is that my back hurts so Im going to lie down on the floor
which is more than getting
but
well yeah
like if I start lifting things today somebody yell at me
I think my REM sleep schedule is slightly changing to account for buggy
I would have been like overworked a little
Wha
My REM sleeping schedule is accounting for buggy now I think
eh Ive been randomly waking up at like six thirty
Alright Im gonna try this out
half way between buggy and when I usually get up
ye
Youre bodys average its like Split the difference
aw theres stuff up on this one
ohhhh
you wanna have this on
yeah
Im gonna try that one
If anyone sees me lifting you are totally allowed to yell at me
ahhhw this is dirty
I wouldnt do that no Im thinking Ill proly fall off
theres something
this scary I cant even get up here
then Im gonna try
okay so the push captains are
or proly I should give you
wha
so you just do what you want righ
the captains are getting called
course walks are done
if you want to clean windshields Im not sure thats been done
Oh God theres nothing to wear oh God
Im on it
this is not a good idea
weve got twenty five minutes til chairmans
oh my God
you cant get down now
and then if you look out the window
oh youre youre evil
you had course walks so wha was
yeh there was
it was awesome today
oh shish
it just well we also it was about average
it was all ready to go fast more than
ah the only thing that was really bad was
oh my God
hill five so
myself for being bored
we may end up waiting like half an hour instead of starting right at six fifteen but I cant imagine unless it rains again
Im gonna go to sleep then
its gonna dry out its just taking a little longer since those trees shelter it
well I was here to drive
see how
like the trees right out there
so cause the wind has been has dried off pretty much everything except for hill five
or you can just land on top of him
and hill five isnt really
well and as you can see look out the window its not too
its kind of moist but its not you know like its not slick or anything
so so I suspect that er I know Arnolds been driving on it like a madman he probably shouldnt be driving in his state
so now if someone scares me
Im definitely gonna fall
r you asking number
nobody scare Vincent
no loud noises please
I remember up there and Roach banging on the glass on the outside and he almost fell off
yeah I remember that
that sounds kind of nyeh
um its
but yeah its if someone banged on the glass right now I would fall off
yeah
yknow why
ahhhhww why is the course being in such shitty shap
it better not rain Ill be annoyed if it rains
I love sitting where everyone else
I thought you said you were
I dunno I wouldnt mind
e should set
we have twenty minutes til chairmans meeting twenty minutes til chairmans meeting
wait wait shsh
wait whatd he sa
twenty minutes to chairmans
twenty minutes to chairmans
twenty minutes to chairmans
no no
not that um uiigh
oh you said you changed your mind
well like if it rains I wont be annoyed when he
well Ill be upset but Im not going to be annoyed at at Arnold
if it was about the nineteenth or about the twentieth does it make any difference of people being mad at Arnol
oh were not going to be mad at Arnold
oh you said youd be mad at Arnold or something
no
I said I should be mad
no Ill just kill someone
I assumed it would be Arnold since it would be
so youd be homicidal but not to anyone in particular
yep
its just
for failing to call down the rain earlier
well that was all that was nice
oh no I wouldnt mind the rain starting around
a little before eight
we can only roll for so long
I dont really mind some rain unless its like seven fifteen when were supposed to start rolls and then we didnt basically
thing is its gonna be were going to start late anyway cause we wait I suspect unless they decide not to wait for hill five to dry
but I suspect that theyre starting to sweep
is the chute getting dr
the chute is dry
everything on everything thats on like that side of the course is dry because its windy
but because the trees here are sheltering it its its just not dry
yeah
but the chute is like bone dry
this is like CIA nap time here man
is it ever not CIA nap tim
at this time of mornin
can you get me some mil
good point
yeah and maybe ah some grits Yeah
do we get a wakeup fair
or farina farinas so good
Ive never had farina
its like mush
you know the wakeup fairy
but its good once you
would come around and like
touch your sleeping mat and then you were allowed to get up
nainainainai
you couldnt get up without a wakeup fairy
its called the its just the waiting like
dootdidoodidooo

Mike Gordon played Smash Brothers but I beat him so hes not feeling better

theyre going to the cause apparently I have
if you like cook up some chicken or vegetables and add that to the ramen then yeah you can have that maybe a little more frequently
to be making real ramen

And I take a vitamin C supplement so I dont get scurvy
Mina and Shi and Rosa are going to make real ramen
thats my goal
real ramen is like

What were we even talking abou
Well skateboarding houses on hills on beaches in lakes
New York
Yeah
Having a helicopter having a plane
One that goes on water a speedboat
A neighborhood
neighborhood
That helicopter would be pretty sweet
CSKO
Chief skateboarding officer
Oh heh
Chief skateboarding officer
Youd be my CIO
No no uh CITO
Chief information technology officer
I could do that sure
Yo use the Six Sigma and make the information flow a lot nicer
Yeah
but dont get the Six Sigma syndrome
Oh man you know I saw the guy that made that speec
Oh reall
Yeah
Jeff Blogs err Bloggle
Uh like Bogle
Bogle
Yeah I was just sitting across from one of the the current interns
and he was in the middle of a sentence he looks up he goes
yeah thats Jeff Bogle out there
the guy who founded the company and I was like what
Wow
Yeah hes really old
Are the older people like really smar
Uh what do you mea
he older people at the
Would they know how to like do all this shit
that the company doe
like investment
No not investment like the technical stuff
Oh this is a this is a mutual funds company
Yeah so
Oh
so he probably knows how to invest stuff but
Oh
I doubt he really knows that much about technology
Yeah he probably doesnt
I thought it was like uh IT
nah like what I would be doing is IT but
Yeah
but the company itself is like mutual funds and
I mean think of it this way IT is like a lot of like databases righ
right
databases are just like ways to analyze information
right
information that like investors dont really use daily
they just use like say mutual funds or investments
youre just like ok I see this this I should go for it because of intuition or like calculated present value
This is how to analyze all that information how to make it flow and analyze risk and stuff
So people who are making investments dont know anything about what theyre doing
right
His stuff is all like backdrop
What is analyzing risk
Umm so say
Is that like economic
It can be economics
Or is it busines
mmmm statistics
statistics
yeah
aw
statistics is everywhere
thats no no no but thats like
you can have any major
I was an econ major and Ive been doing risk for two years
Thats what Im going into risk management
Yeah but I bet you have to take a lot of stats classes
Fuck that man
All you need to know how to do is Excel
Excel common sense
All my shit was common sense
I had my data team working on the data flow
Thats why you thrived
I was like data team go
yeah it was sad they were forty years old I was twenty and I was telling them what to do
see if I had my way that data team would be replaced by like an intelligent artificial like you know
just basically a machine learning
Oh wait I mean like the thing
automated IT tea
You have no idea dude this guy this guy ok so he ended up getting a promotion and one of my friends from CMU is now doing that job
uh huh
like uh I was like yo you want a job in Japan and like I got it for him righ
this job you pump out two reports a week
the same reports same data pools
aw thats so boring
pull it into an Excell sheet
and make make it every and it takes like two days of like pulling data and putting it
because they dont have a fucking automated thing for this
thats retarded
yup
I mean like he also does like he highlights all the like the weird like anything thats like aberrations err like too high a variance he like
uh huh
points it out but that can all be done on a fucking computer
yeah seriously
Ive written programs that are dumber than that
err I mean smarter than that and they get paid
like fifty thousand a year to pump out fucking bullshit
and I would take that and then I would analyze it
So so what really is like IT the
Oh thats not IT thats for
IT is like setting up the databases
yeah it depends I mean I
one of the things I could be doing is writing applications for like internal use
so like trying to make the business more efficient by like writing a better application that they use
or he could be doing websites
yeah
I mean like uh the company website you have to have you have to have a huge intricate data flow so you know like theres no like idle time for the customer
Thats what Im studying
I dont know if I want to do that anymore
thats the boring shit man
but that depends on the company that youre working for though
you kno
Oh but I thought like I wanted to do that
but like think of it this way
if youre doing this as like if youre doing like um premium stuff for like if youre doing uh for a website design company youd be designing different types of websites all the time righ
right
dont go for the corporate websites corporate websites are usually done internally
go for the ones that are like driving hardest skateboarders
that kind of interesting stuff that could be fun
that means you have to go out collect the fucking
yeah but I bet you dont gotta you dont make shit for money i bet
probably not
I mean like with selling websites its not that bad though
you have to be able to pump it out
it depends man
if you can write a really good website you go to a company and youre like hey look at all this stuff I can do for you
dont smile over at me
dont smile
Youre upset with me
ha no
is this bette
oh
Christin do you ever do the evil ey
stink eye oh man
she doesnt really have an evil eye though its all kinda cute
try baby
no
yeah try
you cant do it on the spot
yeah
it has to be like
guys cant do the evil eye
I I just I just glare at people
yeah
yeah
I cant see Quinn doing it or Timmy doing it
The evil ey
yeah
mines like
Mines just like uh
I cant do like
Its only only if Im really angry
Oh when youre eye goes like
just like
I dunno i just like furrow my brow and im like
In my mind its the most intense
My sarcastic look is just like
yeah
the squint one eye and be like
its just like what the fuck are you thinking
yeah what the fuck did you just say
what you just said made me fucking dumber
and for that Im gonna look at you like this
you know Lerne
Ma
No um
Andrew yeah
He wants to do like so hes MechE righ
Yeah
So hes just gonna go like work for a skateboard company and design new wheels and stuff
Oh thats cool
yeah righ
so like apply what you know to what you like
I still dont know what Im gonna do though
cause like skateboarding
Ill like program the next smart snowboard or something
put in the speedometer
yeah
like in the gravity boards
that wouldnt be too bad you just look down and you see like how fast youre going
yeah
they have those in the gravity boards
airtime
you jump and youre like alright
Itd be a lot better if there was some kind of electronic thing that could transmit into a watch
oh yeah ok
cause looking at your board could be really dangerous if youre going down youre just like
what does that say
its like youre like what the oh shit cliff
Ive definitely had to do that like if the board gets too much snow on it you cant move it around very well
cant you just pop it of
yeah i mean it depends some snow sticks to it
or like gets caught up on your
see i think i would just jump up in the air and just
just grab it
nonchalantly just
could always do like a backflip just kick it off
I could just pee it on pee on it
while youre movin
thats dangerous pissing into the wind
yeah
yeah just gotta be like
Hey did you read that article about Googl
No what articl
Um the one about the like the US government having issues with Google um policy on not giving them information about who searches what websites or what websites they hi
No like whats going o
Um like ok so the story goes like this
Google well a lot of search engines have been like targeted by the governent
hmm
because they want to be um sort of they want the government wants to like crack down on things like pornography terrorist
Yeah
sites you know and all that sort of nonsense and um so they asked search engines to give them all the information about who hits what sites and Google was one of them you know because
right
like a the major search engine
Right right right
and um uh they basically were like um Noo heh
Yeah thats good
I mean they stalk us enough like
I know seriously and then um but I I mean like so they said no and theres a whole court case going on and I I mean like I just I mean you kind of feel like youre not the things that you do youre always being watched
I know like the government in so Big Brother right now like
I see
but like theres no they have no right to like spy on us and were already like spying on each other enough with like Facebook and everything
Right exactly
like there is no
privacy huh the Internet is so not safe
But what ok wait alright whats the deal with Faceboo
I dont like actually like sororities and stuff like theyre all like all the Greek organizations are like You need to like make sure your Facebook is safe because like uh the police and um even like employers like buy Facebook profiles
Right
from the schools and then they like look on your Facebookand and like if theres pictures of you with like alcohol and youre underage theyll like arrest you or like not hire you and stuff like that
Arrest yo
So theyre gonna arrest you
Yeah like the police can buy Facebook profiles and they like they arrest people
Right
Doesnt tha
Well I how come a lot of people not know about thi
Because I feel like you know like the word isnt spread around because if thats the case then why would people you know like still have those images up or I guess you know
People dont think about it
Theyre just like Oh I need to pretend that Im cool
so Im gonna put like the funniest picture I can up and like its so stupid cause like its like politics is gonna change in the future because like every politician is now gonna have like evidence
solid background yeah
of the bad things they did in college
Oh my god thats crazy
So we need to be more careful I guess but
But I think like thats your own page it shouldnt be like I mean we cant access other schools and you can lock your profile
Yeah but you the police can buy profiles and then they can
No but like I
No like they can they they have ways and like you can also like people like save pictures that you have in your like albums
Ok Ok
and then like even if you take it down they have that picture saved
Oh wow
Yeah
thats like a crazy I really didnt know
Its like this huge controversy
And like I mean it started out just like um we had to have like repre like we wanted to represent the fraternity
Right right
well like people from nationals would um like get people in trouble for having certain things that would be against the rules
Oh my god
on their profile and obviously like you shouldnt be breaking the rules
Right
or whatever but if you do like dont take pictures of it and if you are dont put them on your Facebook
exactly
Like I mean I almost think you deserve it if youre gonna do something like that retarded but
But wait so like I mean so does like does your sorority like have these rules now like dont put certain pictures u
Well
Or wha
were like um kinda hesitant to make rules about it
Right
but were like strongly encouraging people to be careful
Right
and like um just monitor what youre doing and like if you want I mean they did like all these seminars and stuff about it just like whats going on and like what you can do to protect yourself
Right
but I mean its almost like you shouldnt even really have a Facebook profile anymore
I know
Its not even safe
Like that makes me wonder like how many people know exactly what sites Ive been t
That makes me scared
Like it doesnt make me want to use yahoo anymore
I know
it makes me not want to say anything to anyone on Facebook
I hate computers
I just like at the clusters like I dont know if anybody is like looking at what I check online
Exactly
or anything
Its kinda crazy and its its creepy in a way because I mean even the university because you use their lab has records Im sure of where you
Yeah
like have been and stuff I mean theyre more liberal because they dont care I mean its you know
But like the recording industries
Right
can get your IP address
Exactly
and everything
Exactly and thats like a huge issue because I mean IP address means location means this is who you are especially being on like a CMU network like on a university network it makes it a lot tougher I think
Yeah
I dont know its just its crazy the amount of spying that goes on
I know and like even like when you put up a Facebook profile or like a Blog or whatever
Right
like you youre asking to be spied on
Exactly
like youre doing it because you want it to be public information but like you dont necessarily want it to be public
Right
you want it to be like semiprivate but still like
I mean if you think about it you know just how they did on the phone like if you would say certain key words like god or you know like some religious term
mmmhmm
they would like pick it up and listen to your phone call and here I feel like thats the same thing on the Internet they would probably have the sites and a lot of filters saying ok these are the set of key words and like lets go to these sites and see whats happening and then you know like I guess find people out that way
I mean how would you hide stuff like that I mean Im sure theres like a lot like I know like in Germany they banned the whole like Adolf Hitlers biography or autobiography Mien Kampf
mmmhmm
and then like the fact is you can still find it on the Internet which I find hilarious
because like I mean what can the government do I mean how can they block tha
Yeah
Its its seriously like I mean maybe that is a good thing I mean you cant really censor everything and then
Yeah
and you shouldnt do it because its I guess a sort of freedom you know that people
Its a freedom but its also like people are abusing it like
Well thats true but then you cant be all like secret about it
Yeah
like that that scares people and you dont wanna I dont want to be fearful everytime I go to a site that like I I use a search engine that like my information will be sent and people are looking at you know where I go and stuff like I dont know thats just creepy to me
But you know like I know in Dubai that they block sites they just completely dont let you go into sites like I was trying to look for um whos that guy that was had all those predictions about all the
Oh Nostradamu
Yeah Nostradamus
I was trying to I I had read something about him and I was trying to Google it to find more information and like the site was blocked
I was like Its Nostradamus I can understand if its like a porn site or something
Yeah
but its like like they took no they had I dont think they like like other religious advertisements well like like not religious but I would say um Pagan sort of
Yeah
symbollisms and like and beliefs you know that this can happen they dont like that so they completely block the site heh it was so funny
Like yeah I dont like the idea of censorship and everything but at the same time you cant go on Google without typing like some random word that like you would think is innocent and then getting all these porn sites
Exactly like yeah Ive had that happen to me and Im like ummmm because I was trying to look for a movie and it just like shot up a whole bunch
even if like the words are not related
Yeah I mean its like this is an innocent word I dont understand
I know I know
So we need like some censorship I guess but I mean without like
harming people
its harming people yeah and like
infringing on peoples rights
But thats tough I mean like I dont know how porn sites are gonna do it because like I mean how do you tell if a person is eighteen or no
yeah
I mean you can lie over the Internet it happens over AIM it happens over MSN you know people lie to each other about their age and then get people talking so I dont know
So well change topics when we get to my skirt er my dress whatever
So I bought this like long skirt from this girl who sells you know things from India
uhhuh
Um and shes doing it as like half for her profit and half for helping out her grandmothers um orphanage that she
they they are running
oh wow
and so that skirt was like twenty five
to buy and um and then it had it had like a slight rip in it so she made it fifteen
so so i bought it
I was like its nice
and it has a lot of fabric so I figured I can alter it change it
um so so what I wanted to do with it was like well I could either make a pillowcase out of it
cause its a nice little cushion that I could have or
i kinda actually wanted as like a like a sundress like this on top
Oh yea thatd be nice
yea and then it would kind of like fit like here but its hard to make it that way
so then i was like
well and then so I was trying to ask my grandmother for help
and i asked her and she ended up just getting it shortened
which is not what I wanted to get done
oh
so
so I took it all apart
and luckily I still have enough fabric leftover to make it
but it would have to be now in two pieces
so now Im like
well maybe Ill just make a separate skirt that I can wear and a separate like tube top kinda thing
So Im working on it I dont know
I havent decided
I I still could make into a sundress though
It would just be in two pieces I would have had to connect it here
which isnt a problem cause I would have to like cut it here to make it fit anyway
uhhuh
So it would be interesting but in anyway in any case
Why didnt you go down to uh JoAnnes sometim
I dont know I just
You didnt want to go
I dont know where that is
Its in
rob uh Robinson town center
ive passed by it a few times on the bus
Its actually kinda nice
reall
oh
okay
Theres a Sams Club theres a Best Buy Compusa Best Mart two different ski shops Theres Theres a whole mall
everything JoAnnes which is the uh
Theres Noblemen JoAnnes which is the
uh fabric store
i needed to get a button for one of my shirts and
i need to get um thread for my pajamas which have a giant hole in them
ok
The tone of Ys voice is kinda of lackadaisical
hahaha
ts ok when im at home and Im wearing pajamas with a giant hole I like them theyre really comfy
But
you know well if someone visits me then I have to go and change
when guests come over I have to go change and theres
We get a lot of people in my room like friends who just come
people in your roo
yea I mean I mean just uh friends who come visit
yea
I want some sugar
perspective more sugar do you have troubl
no Im already
I thought you were
nah im okay
So whats this that youre adding to our te
Its sugar
This did not ook like sugar for some reason I dont know why
Taste it
I dont use MSG
Oh oh I believe
I believe you that is
Its sugar
Its sugar
I use MSG
Its not good for you
Its not good for you but neither is Coke and everything else
But people drink that
Caffeines not good for you either
Thats true
Caffeines in tea
Tea gives you antioxidants
What exactly does that mea
It um its like things that will help your cell recover from free radical damage
which is like
free radical damag
so like theres these things that like yes these things that like go around in your body yea
whatever
I still dont know what that means
yea
oh my god
yea its okay
thats okay
so yea thats how antioxidants works
so thats okay
and tea usually has less caffeine than coffee
hu
I told you uh I drink a cup of tea almost every morning
which isnt bad
ha
Youve become caffeine dependent
See what I like is like I usually try to avoid caffeine normally so that my body gets used to functioning normally
and then when I need to stay up all night I can just like have a cup of coffee and itll buy me like three or four hours
cause my bodys not used to all that caffeine
this is like the people who do not drink for a really long time so that they get their tolerance really low
so they only need like two beers to get drunk
yea exactly
kinda like that
so
but
u done with the suga
Yea
I dont know
I mean I dont think its much of the caffeine
I think its more of a psychological effect of
caffein
yea i think i think if i got up in the morning and just
just put warm water in my teacup and drank it it does the same
I dont think so
Caffeine actually does make your brain fire more uh
like cause it basically puts your body into a state of like emergency energy recall or whatever
uh huh
it makes like u need to like
burn off more energy cause its like high alert so it does stimulate your brain to be a lot more alert so
so for the first few days youll feel the effects of caffeine withdrawal at first so youll feel headaches and youll feel lethargic and all that
and then
and then afterward you might you know
I
I will go by without caffeine without drinking my tea in the morning
emhm
Its just I always wake up too late
Youre always late Robert
I am always late
as everybody here knows
Or Ill forget my cup on my table oh Ive done that a lot of times and you cant drink tea after its been soaking all day
em hm
Its Theres stuff theres too much stuff comes out of those tea leaves stuff that you dont want to be drinking
oh okay
I think I dont know Its just the act of making the tea
like a little ceremony in the morning
Its something to do first thing in the morning besides you know wake up brush your teeth and wash your face
getting dressed get online
get out of my holey pajamas
em hm
I wonder if these
the tapioca tastes the same
I think that they taste the same
I was so happy when I found them in china town
I was looking for them
I was asking around
theres one girl who spoke really good English and was Chinese in the
so this girl speaks English I can talk to her
so like do you know where they would sell you know like the bubbles the tapioca pearls from bubble te
She thought I meant bubble tea
So she told me a store and I was like no no I dont need bubble tea I just want the actual pearls so that I can make them on my own time later
So she goes oh I dont know
and then we just walked down a little bit more and then we went to the bakery
And then we went to
whe
over Spring break
oh
and then wha
you went hom
yea
and then we went to I was there twice
ah ha
and we went to uh the grocery store
and
And then like I found them
They were like right by the doorway
It was like Awesome
I walk in
and Im looking for this stuff and I just I turn I like walk in I turn and look to my right and there they are in this like little thing and theyre like stacked up
and theres a lot of them and its just like tapioca pearls
and it says ready in five minutes
and I was like perfect
well you can get tapioca pearls here you know in the strip district
well I dont go to the Strip District remembe
you still haven
oh
I dont have a car
I do I stay within the Oakland SquirrelHill radius
Its easier on my life
So but um
So yea so
so Thats where I bought them
and I was like sweet
and then I tried it that night and I was like oh
this is actually good
and so we were gonna go back the next day cause my friend Victoria was staying with me for break
and so shes never been to New York city
cause shes from Chicago and so shes like eh New York you know I Im from a city
But I was like you need to come
If like you know she wasnt doing anything for Spring Break besides going to see her brother in the later half
So I was like why dont you come home with m
So I was like I would love to have you come you know stay at my house
Youre more than welcome to
um and uh just come see New York with me cause Im right there
So shes like okay let me ask
you know and you know I asked my parents
And we worked it out and so we both flew home on Saturday
night and we went out to dinner
oh
We went to we got lobster and little neck clams it was the most and she got king crabs
ohh
and uh you know my parents took us out to dinner
It was so fabulous It was just so good
hhh Nick youre gonna have to come up off the floor because your voice is going to be muffled which will cause me problems
oh youre ↑recordin
ihhh yes Im recording
so what do you have to do this weeken
well too much
but focusing on tonight I dont know if you heard
I was talking to Nicole
and Im picking her up around six forty five
then were going to see a movie
and then were going out for dessert or coffee or some other type of girly thing to follow up on our girly movie
which one are you seein
I dont know yet
I am hoping for the duchess so I might just be like
were going to see this movie unless you really want to see the other one
also because the duchess is playing around the corner so I could park here for free
thatd be nice
wheres she liv
NewHouse
oh thats right
so what are you doing tonigh
I dunno
maybe Ill watch tv or a movie or read
play the ↑new
ihhh probably play the news
theres still a few games I have to do
do you ever get any extra credit for ↑tha
no
just do it for fun no
yeah
I got extra credit first time
does your professor know you still play i
no hhh
hhh I told her once but I dont think she plays it
so sh I dont think she cares hhh
hhh That company only made two games
and one is that one and one is the other one I got extra credit for
weird
are they from around here or are the
yeah
and theyre CMU based or they graduate graduates of CMU
mmhmm
I dunno where they are now
probably California where all those video game people are
although I think they might be on CraigStreet actually
and I think about it
because I think you used to have to go down there to take the test
oh
or to play the other game
thats where all of those paid experiments are now and I find that extremely annoying
because I used to be able to do paid ones in the bottom of Baker
you know through that websit
and I just dont feel like walking over to Craig Street or running there to do a fortyfive minute experiment
mhmm
and then run back
where do they do the MRI one
I think somewhere in the South Side
cuz someone I talked to went and she said they picked her up and everything
wow
but yeah
and those are like a hundred fifty bucks righ
I think so
it depends
um some paid more than others
someone I ↑thought got paid almost four hundred dollars but it was because you had to keep going back
yeah
whereas I think the one time ones are like seventy five or a hundred
hmm thats still a lot of money
speaking of which I heard back from that guy about the experiment we were looking into
and he said that you only get gift card
although then everyones entered into a raffle for a hundred and fifty dollars
but he didnt say how long it would go on for
which made me suspicious
gift cards for wher
gift cards
he didnt say
he said like ten to twenty dollar gift cards max
but he also didnt indicate if it was per couple who went or per person
hes sneaky
mhm
you should email him back and ask specific questions
I would like to know more about compensation pleas
although oh theres free dinner though too but its like a two or three hour time commitment
I know once a week
that is so long for twenty buck
thats what I was thinking
unless they have really good dinner
cuz I hate cooking
it has to be a really good dinner
hhh but it also means no dishes
so what is i
they just record or that we have to do the same question packe
he didnt say
wed have to do a phone interview
and then possibly be qualified or eligible I guess
that sounds like more work than its worth
yeah
I know I shouldnt care about science but
not this semester
no
there are easier experiments that you can make money with
from
yeah maybe Ill look into some of those
you hardly ever have time during the day though
well if I do stuff after three I have time
three to five
but I dont think they have that many then
the ones I see are always like in the middle of the day
hmm
I do have a lot to do
although when I write down the actual assignments
I guess there arent that many of them numerically to finish
but theyre huge
mhmm
so Im really glad at least Im done with the NSF
mm yeah
that should be a load off
the Russian thesis is still really hard and I need to work on that this weekend as well as this project
which I cant believe how much of our grade its worth
well its like twentyfour points out of a hundred
so a hundred being the whole class grad
yeah
thats quite a bit
°yeah°
what time do you register on Monda
I think around ten to noon
Ill have to double check that
I register at one but I got an email
today from my linguistics advisor saying for a two English classes that I have to take she wants us to register through the English department
because
you can do tha
I dont know
she just wants us to go there and do that so that we can get in
but to me that completely undermines the whole seniors go first
yeah
so I know Ill end up getting in to them
so Im not even going to worry about it because they have to let me into them
because its my last semester
but its just annoying that now instead of registering online
which Im going to try to do anyway
that I should have to go to the English Department
well your linguistics advisor doesnt seem to be on top of things anyway
no
shes not
it still irritates me about all of the stuff with my research and how she doesnt know anything about it
well at least it counts for your thesis
she hasnt done any of that yet though
that makes me nervous
because I got an email the other day from the dean
and by the other day I mean a week or two ago
saying that like he sees that Im doing the honors thesis and for my graduation requirements for my majors
I dont know how he knows this but like am I doing three theses then
am I doing a Russian one a linguistics one and an honors thesi
and I said no
my professors supposed to have talked to you about combining my linguistics thesis with my honors thesis
because thats what it is
and he said well she had mentioned it in passing but she hadnt filled out any of the paperwork
and that she needs to do that soon
which means its not going to get done
and I dont think it should be my place to have to remind her
yeah but you might have to
well I will
like if I cant register next semester or something
but
I still have to find out about if I can do research
at least with Borzutsky
I have a feeling I wont be able to because shes very busy
and teaches in Heinz
but she likes you and I dont think supervising you would be that hard
Goldman only meets with me like once a month
yeah I know
and thats for my entire Russian thesis
but I also think if I did research itd probably have to be a broader scope like the new Cold War
or something
you mean like your boo
yeah like two of my books have the same name
because uh
very creative
I know
someone else is uh doing Georgia versus Russia conflict
but well see
plus I dunno if I would be able to do independent research in the department Im not well I guess you are so
dont use that excuse
Ill ask her and well see
because if I dont if Im not able to with her I dont know what I do
maybe Ill ask my Middle East professor if I can do a research project
I need to focus on applying to grad school too
because I was thinking next semester Im going to have interviews and things which means over Christmas break I have to brush up on all of my readings
which I still think its sad that thats the only thing Im interested in at this point the psych research
and what I have least time for even though thats what Im going in to
yeah
I dunno I think that once youre in the field
you can change interests
well maybe not in psych
well I wouldnt want to change interests
not once Ive started
well I dont mean once you start I mean once youre a professor you can study whatever you want
yeah a lot of history professors like Miller hes Irish History but hes teaching my Christianity class
thats true
and were nowhere near the Protestant Reformation
so I dunno where the hell hes coming from IreIreland
ancient Galilee
I really like the learning mechanisms though
and I like that thats so broad
but at the same time you can look at it in a very narrow focus
I dunno anything about those so
didnt you read my essay
I did
anyway
I should probably start getting ready
yeah
for my girls night out
I thought you were going in like an hour
yeah
but I need to dry my hair put contacts in put my makeup on
Ill never understand
I wonder if there is a thing
things
random
yeah he kinda just has random information at his finger tips
i dont know how
i dont either
therere just some people that can do that
i dont get it
like there are some people who find out everything like social things to
and just know everything thats going on
wait what do you mean social thing
like who know all the gossip
thats what i mean
reall
and I dont get that by Dan
i dont know if its theyre told or they just figure it out
it would have to be a mix righ
i would assume
you would have to be perceptive enough to see things and then
people would have to trust you enough to tell them
yeah
tell you about them
but i dont see Tyler as one of those people
no I don i feel like he doesnt know like social stuff
just random information
kind of I think i dont know
and i think i agree with that
he seems not socially awkward
cause hes not awkward
i mean hes awkward but not
in the social way
hes just a bizarre person
so
hes just weird
yeah
which in my mind
in a good way
makes it difficult for people to want to come to him
mhmm
and therefore makes me feel like hes not actually perceptive
but maybe im wrong
so what you got a spicy tuna and something els
california roll
what is a california roll
other than in my mouth right now
um its rice on the outside with sesame seeds
the inside is umm
fly fish row
avocado
cucumber and umm
crab but its fake crab
the fish kind
its
imitation crab
i mean i suppose it could be real crab but this isnt
how do you kno
i know what imitation crab looks like
and i know what crab looks like
thats a good reason
and crab is a lot more expensive
and they just wouldnt use it
okay
so really i could eat it if i wanted it
thats kind of useful information
mmm its fish
right
I mean i eat fish on occasion
so thats why i say if i wanted to eat it
umm so yeah
my conversation with Max
didnt escalate to anger or crying
yay
what were you guys talking abou
uat the first thing we spoke about
was umm
the Matisyahu concert
ok
umm
very briefly and his
umm leaving me to walk with Bri
by myself
mhmm
and how that
like pissed me off amazingly so
and hes like im sorry i read the situation wrong
like it seemed to me like you two wanted to talk to each other
so i was just gonna leave you alone
im like yeah no that was not
not the case at all
but umm whats done is done
and theres nothing to do about it
and then
we started talking about Hillel
because Rachel talked to him last night
i know
and he
thinks hed do a really good job as president
and so really wants it
and he knows that being rush chair is
a conflict of interest
but he still really wants it
she told me he didnt seem think that the copresident was a good idea
he doesnt
did he say wh
umm
he doesnt
like the concept of copresident
unless
the two parties
umm
lack
a skill set
that the other one possesses
in high demand
umm
and he doesnt believe that thats necessarily
the balance between rachel and he
umm
so hed
be more willing to be
vice president or
president with
vice versa
but he really doesnt seem to understand that he
like
that being rush chair is not
just a problem
its a huge problem
and that he really shouldnt hold both positions
so
can you
kind of
vocalize
what the problem with him being rush chair i
because i know its a problem and i
know like in my head why but i
cant necessarily put it out
correctly and
so my feeling is that
the issue with him being rush chair
and trying to take an active role
in Hillel
comes a lot from looking at Dave Lewis
Dave Lewis during the orien the entirety of rush
barely participated in anything Hillel
like if we had an a Hillel event
it could either be a rush event
in which case he would come
mhmm or he wouldnt come
because there would be a rush event
that night so he couldnt
like the balance was improper
and i mean
its a question of
time devotion in my mind
and
Max claims that hell be present and be able to lead
and not ha and have it not be an issue
so thats what i was like one of my main things
when i talked to him and he thinks that he
can manage his time and his energy
but from what i saw this year
he cant
right
it is of my belief that he cannot
he still believes he can
he also believes that
ummm if not this year then he will never do it
because this year to next year are his two light semesters
umm the two semesters in which hes not
overloading in course work
and hes not working
and hes not doing research
all three combined
so he has time to devote to Hillel
to which my respond is
and AEPi
and he doesnt really understand that the
two are huge time commitments
that hes
eith hes gonna shaft one
and it will be Hillel
and it will be Hillel
so i think what he told me his concern was
not knowing how to present himself
if he was both at the same time
like introducing himself to peopl
and be like hi
cause he really shouldnt aat least he knows he
shouldnt be at Hillel and be like hey come to AEPi tonight
correct
eventhough we can do that
i think
we can
but thats because were doing it socially
and hes doing it with an agenda
yeah
umm but like
when you introduce yourself to someone
the question is how are you introducing yourself
are you introducing yourself just by nam
are you introduc introducing yourself name and then associatio
and he specifically said in when i was talking to him that he didnt want to be introduced as Hillel president
like
associated with Hillel
is fine but being president was not
okay and im like well then
i dont like
you cant
any other
position thats fine but president
thats the point
right
so
i think hed be okay at VP
i think hed be good at it
i think hed be fine
he can stay there
but i agree i dont want him
moving up
Rachel doesnt want to
cause a conflict
correct
ok and i think that
i dont think shed be a bad president
umm
i dont
think she would be the best
i i can see where Max would be better
umm but
im not convinced that he will actually
perform to his capability
and i understand that Rachel gets frustrated
and can burn out really quickly
and thatll take a while for her to come back
from that but umm
i think its
i think thats better
than having devotions elsewhere
maybe im wrong
i think that if the board is like
there enough
that having a weaker president is better than having one who is split
but can we rely on them
that was the question that Max posed
yeah that was what I said and that was why I said
how is he
at Hillel
you cant rely on having a strong board
but
but then what are you relying on
right are you relying on solely the president
we cant do that
we cant do that
and Max himself says that hes not a programmer
he gets things done
when
other people come up with them
yeah and hell enable others to get their things done
but he cant
like hes not the brain
behind the everything
hes a powerhouse not a
right
so
so you need the board
and if
hes not relying upon them
then im a little afraid
so
again
i dont know where that leaves us
and i dont know whats gonna happen
not to mention that he wont be there for elections
which is going to make elections really really odd
cause hes running for
high up positions
if you want umm an avocado
piece youre welcome to take one
i might
okay
so where does this leave
the election
i have no earthly clue
umm im still not convinced that we have the rest of the board figured out
i talked with Dave Lewis doesnt want to do it
okay
like for sure
cause it like i mean thats kind of what we assumed
but got the feeling that nobody actually asked
its true no one asked him
i mean if hes up for master righ
i dont know
I mean no ones like definitely telling
me what the nominations were
unless i gues
or
ask an individual
ike were you nominated for anything
yeah so i me
i dont understand
theyre being dumb
i mean
Joe told me but hes like
i dont remember
i honestly dont remember
off the top of my head
umm i feel
like its Scott Dan
and
Dan Eisenber
and Dave
up for master
i think
Scott would be the best
Dave Lewis is already
too bitter to take it
and Dan Eisenberg
would be would be herhorrible
i mean it would just
i feel like so much would be missed
if he were
yeah
because hes not
a persona
i feel like
do
why has he has
been in a better mood
Dave Lewi
yeah
like markedly better
or is this just because like
i dont think
ive hes
stopped like not
talking to me and im percieving it as like hes in a better
i dont think hes actually been
any better
ok so
im fairly certain that
this is how hes been since freshman year
too
ok
this is now i have an altered perception
i dont think hed be bad
im afraid of his bitterness
its really it
i think it depends on if he
sees it as a
like
i have responsibility
let me do my best
ok
ll i mean
cause he was
fine as
membe
yeah but
i actually dont know why he was member
because members like the person you turn to
if you have a problem
i dont see people turning to Dave Lewis
umm
didnt he want master and not win i
i dont remember
i feel like no one remembers
and like people who do wont tell me
no onell be like yeah this is what happened
because their not going to tell you
who lost last year
its just not appropriate
yeah
umm see now i just want more sushi
umm but
no take it
you like it so much have one
i ate seven no
more than that
nine ten eleven
umm so i dont know
i dont know i dont see him as master
like i i really do think hell itll be so self destructive
i dont think it would necessarily be good for him
or i feel like it
cgo either way it could for him
and good for the house or
it could be really
detrimental
really bad for him
and still ok for the house
or it could just suck for everything
so what i was saying is he was good at booth
but i dont remember exactly what his
didnt he like die during booth
basicall
oh he did
but he did it really well
like the booth was amazing
but he destroyed himself
so
he has that trend
i dont think its a good one so
i dont wanna promote it
although its not like we get
to vote
yeah right
right
umm
what are we gonna do on sunda
when like for hours and hours and hours
i wont be here
you wont
be here i forgot
im gonna be missing my first like legitimate
girls out of the house forever
elections
its okay
but
im sure were not doing anything
ill be up
so when you find out can
you like give me a cal
mhmm its easy enough absolutely
umm but eboard doesnt actually
like get changed until
later right
until
the spring
so theyre still eboard
through
winterbreak
mhmm
so why
after November
are they like fre
cause is this like a transition perio
so they at they dont have as many responsibilitie
or they have more because they have to teach the new eboar
umm i think they dont have as many
because the new eboard is trying
okay
umm
i th i mean i think
im fairly certain its not like
the day after elections
is the new eboard
umm because that would seem silly
to me but i dont
exactly remember the transition
process
right
umm
yeah pretty much
im sure its after major board elections
because whatll you know
like you cant hold certain
positions and then what if they
do because youre on major like
board position
i dont know makes sense
so ill be out like
cause on sunday nights
im out all night so
ill just ill text you
yeah i wanna know
ill text you
the info
does your or email
youll have your phone
will do
umm i
i feel like none of them are really good choices
like Scotts really like
hes like a fun guy
and like really great but
i feel like hes not like a leader
he did i really good job with greek sing
did h
yeah
uhhuh
umm organized meetings
got everyone together
hes really organizational
which is i think very good for a President
like im not really sure what JB does
per se
umm
like i said JB is a really olike interesting choice and i
wish i was here last year
so much to like see
all of the stuff that went
on and i feel like id have
so much better
he
see who people were before
umm i wish i remembered the elections last year
but he i think was the better
choice
i think it was him and Dave Lewis
im pretty sure ive heard that
i would buy it
like maybe someone else but ii
i dont think that hes bad
its really interesting
because hes not Robbie
not at all
and even now i
see how he would
s master of the
but
i think it was interesting because
after Robbie
the house basically swore not to have another sophomore
master and then they elected JB
which i thought was really interesting
why did they not want another fre
because of inexperience
and its just being young and
stepping into the role
umm like Robbie
advised against it
and JB was like well who else
is gonna do it
righ
so he wanted it but
also
i think that because of the way
elections work
both at Hillel and
at AEPi cause
they kinda work the same way
i think period of time wise
its a really difficult place because you cant have
seniors in positions which
are sort of people who really have had
well you you cant have yeah current
seniors cause theyll be gone
umm so that gets rid of like that whole
year of
people whove had the most experience
and you cant have freshmen
because they
just dont know anything
yeah not for AEPi
you like
we can for Hillel
because we need to
but yeah
so youre left with
sophomores
and juniors
and
i mean you can get
a senior whos running
now like whos a junior now
and so will be a senior
in the spring
or the following fall
yeah like Joe
like Joe
which i think is very good
i think yeah
like i think you need more of those
but how many people would
by that and plus you have to have
some experience
you really should do it like
for more than one year
and its just a weird like
thinking of
like sophomores being on eboard
is like wow thats really young
and next year itll be the same thing as
the same like age wise
do you know
umm who was nominated for leiutenant maste
yes Brandon
i know Brandon and thats it
Big J
okay
there might have been a third but i think
thats it
because like im also trying to pair
like people for master
i think that Brandon will get it
i think he will too
but i feel like Big J really should be on eboard
i think hed be good on it
but he might drop down
i dont know
him as a good sentinel
okay
see i can see him more as
member
I could see that
but i dont know if he would run against Henry i think hed be better
at it than Henry
cause i feel like people go to Big J for
things and not as much
and not
as much Henry
even though i think Henrys really good
probably should be on eboard
but i think that to some extent certain
people choose what they want and then
other people just fill in the spots
correct
which doesnt always work well
it doesnt most of the time
but if you need a
body of people
yeah
umm so my deal with Henry
is that while hes a really great person
i feel like i dont trust a lot of his decisions
like Alex
umm and therefore
like i wouldnt go talk to him
about issues of that nature
i just
i dont know i mean
he and Zach like kinda confuse me a little bit as
regards their place in the house
like in the grand scheme of
Zach doesnt
confuse me so much wait
which Zach
Zach
he doesnt confuse me so much
i mean i just i didnt think
of them as like
really like
kind of up there people
well i guess as far as like
power positions in the house
thats true i dont
i i mean i
dont see them as power positions
but i see them
as
umm people who can get the job done
like look at Zach with buggy
yeah
although thatll be fun when he
cause Zach doing buggy around Carnival
and eboard will
im sure be loads of fun
but umm
i think hell be a good exchequer
hes not opposed righ
hes unopposed
i mean unless someone drops down
which Dan might
Dan might
im not exactly sure he wants it though
i dont know him at al
i mean hes been around
a little more i feel
like sitting around
on the downstairs more
i dont know
as oppose to earlier in the
i want to invite Beth out one day
just be like i wanna
shes really nice
i wanna be your friend
please join us
umm
i think the next time we have a large group of
us we should invite
all them and like i think Lizzy would be fun to have around
Lizz
uh
Wallnau
oh ok
cause she
she seems really like friendly and like quirky
i dont know anything about her
i dont either but she seems
like pretty
yeah
i
have to start
are you going that wa
i am headed
towards Craig St
in honesty
oh this its gross
so much soy sauce
okay um alright so animal rights
alright
uh I just had a page open about it
I closed it when I was trying to find the recorder controls
oh here it is
okay
so this is basically a radical vegetarian organization that believes that animals experience suffering are to some degree intelligent and therefore its immoral to keep them in labs factories farms etc
and that they should be placed in homes to live out their natural lives free from suffering
I think its hard to say though that its doing more harm than good
well I guess from a purely net gain standpoint more people profit from
well I dont know if that true is true actually
dont you think uh humans eat more animals than humans enjoy eatin
than humans enjoy eatin
well I mean we need to eat
if you if you put it that way its really all or nothing were either eating these animals or were not and
well you dont have to eat meat to survive
no but if youre going to say that we do eat meat given that we eat meat we need to keep eating meat
not necessarily why do we have to keep eating i
if were saying that for the purpose of animals as food theyre really only useful as long as they continue to be useful
yeah I know but if were taking the stance that theyre
well I dunno but lets for say for the sake of argument that they are uh do feel pain and they are intelligent or at least as intelligent as a very stupid human
or maybe
its not
well
I think its just really hard to say that um we should be like liberating animals on such a large scale especially considering whats done to humans at the same time
well what do you mea
done to the
whats done to human
aside from whether or not its right putting that aside for one second you if you just allow every animal to live out its natural life in its entirety youre treating them better than a lot of humans get treated
so you d well the animals can do work they can be work animals but its different to have them uh I guess uh okayay so I wouldnt agree with the or you know in this taking this stance I wouldnt necessarily I think they go too far in saying that animals should be removed from labs and factories and stuff but they should be free from suffering that is what is the argument that its one thing to have them work its another thing to slaughter them or keep them in cages where they cant move and stuff
so youre fine with like animal testing and stuff
yeah
you have no objection to that
well it depends what youre testing I guess but yeah ultimately yeah theres no way yeah well it depends how strong of a stance you take you know taking a hard line stance that these animals well I guess the if you test things that are bad for them then you also should be rewarding them somehow is the argument that uh and if the tests
what about lab rats that are specifically bred to have a higher instance of cance
well if its going to help solve cancer in humans then from a purely selfish standpoint we should do it and I would be inclined to agree with the selfish standpoint but but the the point of this I guess is is it moral though because I would be willing to do it if its immoral but ultimately helpful but it might still be immoral to do that
well its not like its not like what they did during the Holocaust and the concentration camps
have you ever read about those surgeons who were basically like tearing little kids up to see how they worke
yeah thats really pretty horrible but
its not like were doing that
well there are some places where we might be doing that to animals I wouldnt be surprised I mean Im sure that theres plenty of really awful stuff thats done to animals or at least that used to be I think that animals rights groups have gained some level of of uh moderation for that
but cause they I mean they are animals rights groups that actually are powerful like PETA or other ones like that
well Im not saying at all that we need to take a step back and say more cruelty to animals Im not doing anything like that
I think where we have now maybe a little bit more regulation on animal rights would be okay but anything radical I think is I dont think is feasible
well lets I mean the question is are animals in fact in you know relatively intelligent things comparatively to lower organisms that suffer you know
are they similar like mammals are mammals similar to humans enough so that maybe its okay to test on insects and stuff or uh bacteria but
well true so
you cant test like you cant run a medical test on a bacteria you cant
so lets
well I mean uh no you actually can run a medical test on a bacteria
youre testing whether an antibiotic works but you cant test whether or not the instance of cancer would be higher in a certain breed of um
okay yeah but what about this then
would it be justifiable okay so were going to say that we have a moral standard which says that we should not hurtharm animals but even less we should harm humans and we can harm animals if it would help humans
is that what were sayin
I guess
or do we just not care about the animal harm to begin wit
well we dont want animals to be harmed if its avoidable we dont were not going to kill animals in the streets just for fun
well actually you probably would kill animals in the streets just cause they really should not be there but thats a different matter
okay but so obviously you dont want to just kill animals for fun but would it be justifiable to say that any animal could be used if its expedient at all for some human purpose and if youre saying that
within reason
well okay within reason sure but
if obviously
its a slippery slope
obviously this would never actually be useful but if electrocuting a cat every day contributed extremely slightly to a cure for AIDS I think thats a little bit in the wrong
you think thats in the wrong
yeah cause even though
but
its really like a costbenefit type thing with the cost being the amount of um benefit uh no the cost being the amount of pain done to an animal
well Im definitely partial to the costbenefit model for anything and I think it works well here too but what about this then would it be justified to kill fifteen people fifteen innocent people to cure a disease and save fourteen people
that depends I think that really depends on in the first place are these people themselves suffering from the diseas
um
do we know tha
uh yeah they are
they are suffering and so are these other fourteen
yeah
okay well thats obviously a point for that its advisable to allow them to die obviously the next part is are they doing this willingl
no theyre its uh unwilling for some large percentage of them
its five people
whats a large percent of five peopl
uh
Im gonna say either three or four
four
so four of them do not want to die even though theyre going to anyway
yeah or yeah well it might not be a fatal disease it it can kill you but it wont guarantee you to die
but the other fourteen are definitely going to die
yes because their disease has pr advanced to the final stage that actually kills you and the other five people that they want to kill their disease is still in the early stages so theyre not necessarily going to die at all
well I think this is a bit of an odd example because there are a lot of questions Id have to lookay at in a specific instance that I dont really anyone could say in such a hypothetical example like why cant we use some of the fourteen people who are going to die anyway instead of the five
because there are two stages to the disease and only we need to kill five people in the first nonle nonfatal stage to save the fourteen people in the final lethal stage
so
or fatal
so these fourteen people are definitely going to die and those five people may or may not die
right but were going to guarantee their deaths to guarantee the lives of fourteen
but you guarantee the lives of the fourtee
well we dont guarantee the lives
how do you guarantee that this cure is going to be successfu
we dont guarantee it
its a ninety eight percent that it will be successful
but these five will certainly die
yes
but those five also couldve died
they might die
and based on the data they die about half the time
so two and a half of them are going to die
in theory yeah so is does that mean the solution is to kill half of the
there are five people
so kill two of them and then chop off one of the guys limbs
in a lot of instances sometimes thats just fitting anyway
laughs
but I think in this instance you kind of need to jut let those five say if they dont want to die and theyre and theyre like and they have a fifty fifty shot you cant kill them
okay so lets do the whole situation with animals except you dont know if the animals are willing to die or not and youre just going to kill some animals to save other animals
lets just assume that there are no humans and you have no way of knowing if those animals would justifiably die want to die but cant you assume that any creature doesnt want to di
I dont think so
I dont think with the majority of animals you can even say there is a want
so you dont think animals have desire
I think they have desires in the form of base instinct
okay
I dont think they have enough comprehension to say well to even deal with a hypothetical
well but wouldnt you agree that to a certain extent humanity is just instinct plus intelligenc
I mean dont people do things a lot because of their instincts even if they might rationalize it post fact
but how can do you seriously think a lab rat has a grasp of a hypothetical situation what if it were to di
uh no but just because you dont have a conception o something bad that can happen to you doesnt mean you dont want bad things to happen to you
so were dealing with a creature that does not understand what it is to die does not understand that it might die and were expecting to assume for it its stance on whether or not it would die for the greater good
well I would argue two things to counteract that what you said
um first of all that its not that it doesnt understand what it is to die I would argue that it understands what it is to die just as much as a human does
I mean do we really understand what it is to di
well thats fair
thats fair
plus um the thing that it really does understand which is the key here is pain
that even if it doesnt understand death it certainly understands pain
and wouldnt were assuming that
does it hurt thoug
it hurts yeah
we dont know that it hurts
no it does
we know that it hurt
it involves removing organs while the creatures alive and
well why cant you sedate i
so well give it anesthetic righ
but if were giving it an anesthetic then arent we already kind of saying that we care about how it feel
I mean if were giving the animal an anesthetic then how can we justify killing it to begin wit
dont you only give anesthetics to things that you want to morally protec
thats true
I mean thats a valid point but again this really depends on your own personal sense on a lot of things
this goes a lot deeper
do you believe in the death penalt
do you think that the death penalty is considered cruel and unusual punishmen
personally I think it is but
well I would agree with you on that but I would also argue that the stance that we share about the death penalty might also necessarily mean that we should support animal rights or that we should oppose animal cruelty to mammals and stuff
okay but if you would permit me to take a stance that I dont actually believe in ends justify the means so I can support a stance that I do believe in the death penalty is supported fairly widely in that um on the stance that
economic righ
wha
economi
economic no
oh okay go on
um the death penalty is not in fact cruel or unusual punishment
because its painles
but torture would be so therefore we have to state that theres a distinction at least in U
s
law between death and um
and pai
homicide essentially and torture
we have to say that death for the purposes of U
s
law specifically is not painful and not torturous
well I dont know if it matters so much the law as what the U
s
does and they do torture you know
well thats a different matter
but when the I mean
whether or not they do torture theyre not actually allowed to
yeah I know but theyre not allowed to because its politically unpopular to allow things like that but I would argue that the United States government supports torture and the death penalty for exactly the same reasons that they dont really care about individual human lives
okayay um
and that by the same token
what you said before there is an economic side a lot of people are pretty much condemned to death because its just not economically fitting
I believe that an average human in general calculations is calculated at like seven million dollars
yeah okay economically speaking the death penalty is expedient but
Im not talking about the death penalty Im talking about like reactions
um costbenefit again
would you save these peopl
is it economically soun
uh well well say it is
there maybe it wasnt seven million maybe it was like seventeen million I dont remember I actually do for some reason remember that there was a seven involved
okay
but when calculating whether or not you should intervene to save lives the value of a human life is calculated and recalculated
okay but umm the argument against the death penalty and against torture would be that that individual human lives are somehow special or that should that they should be protected as a constraint on our behavior
so in other words what you know whats the morality that were gonna say the death penalty is based on
you know like there may be an economic reason we both know that the death penalty is economically sound because otherwise you have to imprison these people and thats expensive
but the reason why I would be opposed to the death penalty is because I dont trust the government to make the determination of guilt because they get it wrong so often
thats true
personally I just think that regardless of the cost I think that denying someone their life is just against everything that aside from basic human rights which it obviously violates
I just think that this is a violation of everything that the government and the country stands for
well I agree but then I guess I am there is sort of an impasse between that and animal right because well would you agree that retarded people or very very stupid people should be treated with the same human right
the same human rights yeah
and therere definitely dumb people who are less intelligent than chimpanzees
uh well yeah
I mean they do exist they might not be very common but there definitely are people who have the intellectual capacity not even as much as an animal
a lot of those people are its a little hard to find people like that a lot of them are in permanent vegetative states
well okay fine
well even then some of those are killed
yeah true well thats another one I guess
I mean the whole vegetative state thing
well I dont know what I would decide in a situation like that
oh well I mean I certainly wouldnt tell anyone to pull my personal plug but if someone requested that their plug be pulled well Id be cool with it
oh yeah but what if well do you support do you think people have the right to suicid
yeah definitely
so you dont think theres even if someones not necessarily in their right mind you think they should be allowed to kill themselve
uh if a psychiatrist says theyre not in their right mind then no
but how do you so what do you go to your local um district court and say I would like to requisition the proper forms to kill mysel
uh yeah thats one way to think about it
and then you have to like make your case this is my psychiatrist he says I am of sound mind and should be allowed to shoot mysel
well first of all I think most people could probably manage to kill themselves and I dont really think they would need to get the permission
so I think that theyd probably be okay with it
the main
but Im saying
in the case in the case that you described
this would never happen in practice
well It would happen
Im saying in your idea if youre saying that suicide should be legal which I mean its illegal for whatever thats worth
yeah well Im talking about in the case of someone
but how would you legalize suicid
in the case of someone being hospitalized or imprisoned that wanted to be commit suicide that would be the case where they would have to get the forms
like in the case where youre under the protective care of the state or of a hospital or something or psychiatric ward or whatnot
well then that becomes assisted suicide
its not assisted you just need permission to kill yourself
but for someone to pull your plug thats assisted suicide
yeah that is and in that case you need the forms
but I would argue the same thing applies for a suicide where youre not actually ill
like if youre in a psychiatric hospital or if youre in a prison
if you just want to commit suicide cause youre unhappy then that should be allowed
so you think prisoners should be able to apply for the death penalt
yeah and think a lot of them would take it
but then where do you see the line that theyre not in their right min
uh the not in the right mind well a prisoner is different because I would argue that being in the prison system is a kind of cruel and unusual punishment or a torture in and of itself just because prisoners dont have very many rights and they arent treated well and you know whatever horror stores about rape and so on
but I would argue that offering death is sort of a necessary humane thing for prison and for hospitals you know the pulling the plug assisted suicide thing if youre suffering you should be able to stop suffering
I think suffering is worse than death
in a lot of cases its hard to judge suffering and no one knows what it is to die whos around to tell you what its like
right which is why I would rather have a mystery over a guaranteed bad thing
well sometimes the evil you know is better than the evil you dont know
that is a saying but I am not necessarily sure that I agree with that at all
you dont think thats ever the cas
well it could be the case but the evil you dont know assumes that you know that it is in fact evil
something after death could be good
or if there is an after death its probably nothing in my opinion obviously
Im just saying uh its not the evil you dont know its the you dont know you dont know
but it could be evil
but also could be good
but just as easily evil thats why its the evil you dont know
but its not the evil you dont know because that assumes that it already you know its gonna be some evil you dont know
no thats just the expression
well I only buy the expression that applies in the case that you know its evil otherwise an unknown is better than a known bad
but the whole point of the expression is that you dont know what it is but it very well could be worse
yes which it could be and its a good word of advice to make sure that you know that he evil you know is really that bad
yeah
but if thats bad you might really want to just go
it depends you know
but if its so what if its so easily worse thats what the saying is trying to get across
but what are really the chances that death could be worse than tortur
I think that kind of depends on whether or not you see the torture ongoing
if someone has a life sentence and if they consider their life sentence a day of torture every day
exactly
maybe theyre better off dead
that would be the case I refer to
if theyve got parole in twenty years then I think theyre making a rash decision killing themselves
well I think its okay if people make rash decisions thats fine
people make rash decisions to do lots of stupid things all the time and we dont
well to kill yourself thats a little final
yeah I know but eventually itll weed itself out of the gene pool
then youre getting into something completely different
yeah I know uh well lets go back to animals though
I think our gene pool sucks enough already like just walk down the street and tell me how many people are doing something good for the gene pool
wait say that again
I think the human gene pool is pretty bad already
oh yeah
if you could just walk down the street and tell me how many people are doing something positive for the gene pool
good point
it doesnt lookay good
yeah good point
um but lets go back to the animals though
okay okay yeah weve gotten a little off topic
Im pretty sure that there are therere uh some level of rights and protections granted to great apes and dolphins and stuff
because theyre deemed humanoid in one way or another
yeah but isnt it a spectru
I mean arent all mammals kind of like humans like I mean we definitely share a lot of genetic material and stuff
I dont think were in the best place to decide where but there is a line somewhere that dictates basically whats human enough because if you say that everything is to some degree human then why draw the line at mammals maybe birds hydras hydras are technically animals if a hydra is then why not a protozoa which is an animallike protist
then why not any other protist then why not any other bacteria theres a line somewhere there is definitely a line
okay but why are we drawing the line and whats the rationale for drawing it where we have i
the line right now is the line at which we think maybe the lines a little off center where we think these animals can understand their own situation in the sense that theyre sentient
uh well I guess the question is is sentience relativ
I mean can you be is there just youre sentient or not or can it be youre kind of self aware kind of sentient I mean I definitely know some people who seem less sentient than others
well yeah I think that any human well not any human if were going back to the vegetative and the disabled mentally disabled no offense to anyone in wheelchairs Im not going to say theyre worse off than apes I think that a chimp is less sentient than a human hands down
okay I agree but so then
hell
hell
uh Im trying to phrase this
couldnt you then say I mean so were drawing the sentience line arbitrarily right now I mean what about
were trying it relative to ourselves
we see our own sentience as our ability to think abstractly to uh think of a hypothetical and to well I mean there are tons of tests for sentience theres the mirror test can you get the animal to lookay at itself in the mirror and recognize it as its own body and its own movements
before to come up with the idea
yeah
then after I used the methods to test that design then you just keep iterating on that
yeah
so youre supposed to use like keystroke level modeling and stuff to test our idea
and UARs
and thats like supposed to support that our idea is a good idea for collaborative shopping
so actually I guess like that we should just look through the model answers to the models and then we can like identify the key areas to work it and we can build our stuff from there
what are we supposed to like do for our keystroke level modeling thoug
are we supposed to compare it to the keystroke level modeling that we did before because
I guess we can
technically when we did that homework they said that it wasnt for collaborative shopping
yeah
so I guess yeah we can just like have some sketches of our final product and just put it in CogTool and compare it against everything else that we have there
mmhmm
I think it would
its going to be hard to like top google notebook
or the right click context menu
yeah like
yeah but see if you make it
you can offer a feature google notebook doesnt
that justify
even if its a little bit longer it would justify using our method instead of that too
thats true
I think thats what we are supposed to do
even if its not faster than google notebook it would be something thats like community based
yup
yeah
yeah its go
its gotta let them you know
its not only about buying a couch its more about building a community apparently
I feel with like the google notebook all it really does is a
like all it does is allow you to like takes a where the page is and then it just and a note
yeah it just like link and then subtext there
yeah
so yeah I mean we could just argue that it takes really like small amount of time to like put stuff on the google notebook but like the entire couch buying process is not limited to just you know putting the list together but you actually have to go through them
and discuss
but yeah discuss you know like maybe list them by price or like sort them by price or something like that
so its only like a small portion
I feel like yeah
you could argue that the time it takes longer
it talks about the group meeting time
do we need to like set up a group meeting time with like Bonnie or Joh
umm its in like two weeks or so theyll have another sign up thing
its one of the mandatory times
so wait is it well have a sign up thing in two weeks or do we have to meet with them in two week
I can bring up the schedule
is the final report the thing thats worth twenty percen
yes
okay
and thats due tomorro
no
n
oh okay
its due December third
then whats due tomorro
nothing
oh okay wow
I totally thought that it was due tomorrow so oh my God
but we wanna get started now so that we dont panic towards the end
so basically what they said was you guys dont have homework for two weeks so you guys should start working on homework six
yeah yeah
okay
did we had three homeworks so far or fou
we had three
yeah theres four and five at some point
yes
ones a think aloud and the others the cognitive walkthrough
yes
homework three was CogTool
and cognitive walkthrough is November fifth
and our group meeting is November tenth
so are they going to talk about cognitive walkthrough tomorro
umm
because I probably will not be able to go to that
no the subject for tomorrow like I know one of them is speed dating which is Wednesday
and tomorrow was
I know I read the paper on it that we had to read and it was about umm favorite objects
and stuff and how like people and like how some cultures are attached to their favorite objects and what they mean and what makes them a favorite object
I need to go to the DMV and get my learners permit
get my
yeah looks like the topic for tomorrow is products and services slash design for self
theres no reading though
uh there is they put is on umm
its not on the syllabus schedule
its on blackboard
and they also have a new schedule on blackboard
ah yeah
it just says TBA but yeah it is on blackboard under the folder
okay so ah
so it looks like we need an idea and some evidence supporting our idea by our
yeah so I guess we can look through the model that they provided the correct model
the correct model
then we can figure out like exactly which aspect we
it seems like a good idea like I dont
remember when we went through in class we talked about like role strain and theres like a lot of role sharing cause they each have to this this
we would want to build something that supports that
and reduce double work
yes
key phrase
double work
its more economical
and tomorrows October twentyseven
theres nothing on like this new scheduling even
it says to be announced but its under every file for every lecture they have
I know but like
they suck at
Im going to check
so it seems like google notebook is kind of what our original idea was in a way
like it saves the link and then you can put a comment
yeah
so why was John so against i
John wanted us to build community
apparently google notebook does not
oh my God
do we call something community notebook
but its the most efficient
it java thats the word really in the title no less
are we meeting with Bonnie next tim
yes please
please yeah
I mean some people who met with John
like Alyssa was they met with John and they were like oh yeah he was so nice to us
dude the guy forgot that we had five members in our group
he mentioned like you forgetting his name
uh so I uh hi
what are you like
arent you the guy that teaches the clas
yeah
yeah I saw you are you the T
are you Arunas T
okay so I guess like on here it says even though John and Bonnie are reading this we have to make it like not with the HCI jargon
yeah you have to make it like
or at least like explain it to a regular audience
act like this is like you know a project that a company like or like work for a client
so do we
should we like decide an idea firs
I think that would probably be a good idea
like go through ideas that support what weve found in the
so are we going to like go through ideas and see which one is most supported by the work that weve done so far
yeah yeah
maybe we should start by kind of going through the models and seeing like
kind of what we were doing in class seeing what the problems were like role strain role sharing umm where all the breakdowns are
and also that really can like you know figure out
can get a very narrow target where on and everything else
yeah we can work on like
I guess this would be the part where we have technology that we are trying to find where it goes in the
yeah
this wiki is like private righ
yeah
okay
okay lets look at
the name of oh flow model thats it
what uh
I should have brought the homework
its on the slides
which lecture is it i
number eight
ah there there ah
model solution to the model problem
which
ah
number eight
no no no like which lectur
methods of making
Ive been counting
hhh
I just watched the office last night
okay
so should we like focus on ah
these are nice
I like the colors
uh should we like focus on the breakdown
they said dont only look at breakdowns
yeah okay
so I guess the first thing that caught my eye was like the the part about verbal planning preference price age and status where they were like uh where they would just sit down and talk about the couches theyve seen and stuff
so I mean thats a good starting point that we can build on and from there add the rest of the crap and other stuff
so we want to replicate
its kind of like replicating what they do in real life but we give it more efficient and
well have to make it so that when they are not home they can still express
yeah and not their conversation
thats community
so we should like let them put in their like preferences before hand
I get the
yeah I guess
yeah I mean
and then like could be like a page where you can like at a glance see what people want
were supposed to support all shopping correc
not just couch shoppin
yeah
okay
well yeah I mean it would be kind of awkward if there was like a if there was like a page that only supports couch shopping
couch shopper dot com
you can basically you know
you can basically like have a
like a say for whatever theyre buying like if theyre buying a table right now
so they start a kitchen table shopping session and then every basically says uh before we start looking these are my likes and dislikes for a kitchen table
key it in and then uh so everyone at a glance here can see basically what people are looking for and what they are not looking for
do we wanna make it like qualitative or like quantitative like preference
do just wanna people like answer in like I dont know like in three four or do
I think we can enter in free form and do the same thing use natural language processing technology to figure it out
yeah see like wheres the line between like what is possible and like what is technically possible
well I know NLP is technically possible
but what is like feasibly possible given our like
I feel like free form might be a little hard
like people might forget to like put things in that they feel is important while
we could like have certain like questions like what is your price rang
to me its like certain categories right and then whether this is a what you want in the couch or what you want in the product or dont want
yeah you could have like plus minuses
thats a problem like stuff for price
wha
like when you got uh
okay for price lists and stuff there should like be a price range right rather than just
and usually price ranges are better
yeah okay
so its an idea
yeah you wanna go
did we ever like go through the ideas on the wik
yeah we can go through them
we were going to but then had that meeting with John
yeah the community meeting
wait no on this wiki like
yeah we havent havent gone through it
that was we made this after the meeting with John
after the meeting
hhh yeah thats why you put like community
all the community stuff
yeah
I was just reading Daves and digital affinity diagram representations like he just put in like all the buzz words we can remember digital affinity diagram representation
we can probably make some features of our system too that you like dont have to use but if you choose to use it like it will make it easier
like something you you can say the space you have to put the couch in
that way like it will check the dim
like if you want to search for couches you can like put the dimensions in and be like will it fit in this space
but like none of the couches umm I mean guess not none but like
some of the couches on craigslist had had the dimensions
the stuff on Macys definately had the dimensions
yeah I mean you could just parse it
have like interns like parse this code
I mean technically the person could just like if they wanted to check the dimensions could just like type them in themselves and the computer would then like check if it fit in the space or
so so like having users entering in their preferences is like the main ide
yeah
I was thinking like each user can designate like five top preferences and then for each one like for each of their ratings their own ratings
they can like base it upon their preferences instead of
I dont know its kind of hard visualize I think but
I mean like in an ideal word world you can just like rate your preferences and then you know the thing would automatically go through all the results and like pick the best couches for you
but the thing is like the repeat
I mean its just like John would be against this because as you look through the couches your preferences would probably change personally in like non deterministic way
well hed also say its that its not supporting communities because your not getting to know your roommates by looking at the couches they dont like which kind of gives you an insight into who they are
well what what if the system just does the community work for yo
like it I dont know because it knows
afterwards it would give a report of this person likes this type of stuff by analyzing how they rated couches
you know like ma maximize the you know total happiness or like min minimize the total sadness
its like Its like pandora or something
a bunch of couches just show up and youre like yes no yes no and then itll
yeah based on your selection this is the kind of person you are
you are a psycho
yeah
okay so what kind of like preferences do we want users to have to enter i
price range
yeah because we have to make sure theyre they can like go across all products too
like ah uh you know what we can d
you know like how in the cultural model we can just base like the preferences on like the cultural model because people like care about these stuff you know its in the model dude you kno
they
theyre definitely influencing preferences
yeah so price like you bought you duh really
uh locatio
slash distance I guess
or we can put it as like location or shipping options or transportation options
cause if youre like buying off like Macys theyll deliver if for you
yeah you dont really care where the Macys is thats delivering it
you just care whether or not how much the delivery is and when they deliver
so how would you enter that i
would there be like a check box I okay with being having it shippe
or you can say umm
like who would be against like getting a couch shipped anywa
if the shipping cost too much and you can are within driving distance
like I guess someones gonna
but is that like isnt it like combine in the pric
if you buy from Macys doesnt it show you the price
to ship it
it doesnt show you with the shipping
the shipping is added on
another issue we have to have though like with letting them enter their preferences is we cant really
Johns like well Aruna has allergies and she says she wont get a one with a cat but then shes actually willing to compromise and get one with a cat
but then we could just as Annie said we could just have them rate their like preferences
but then she might end up rating it really high on the preference list because you know its its an allergy but shell still but shell still compromise at the end
but that could be a factor
yeah she k
she keeps saying that she wont get one with a cat but then like her actions later
yeah like now you say that Im wondering if even having them entering their preferences does it help the community buildin
or does it actually hur
so you know how like people enter
like think about this you know how we enter so much info about you know facebook
you meet someone but you like actually know like what kind of music they like
you know everything about them
theres like less to talk about
you cant really say you like the kind of music because you read it on her thing
so its gotta be like really clear that you stalked that person
so you get to act like
are you talking from experienc
no speaking there was an XKCD comic that made me think of it
umm so
so like what if
okay so if each user had five like five preferences and then each of the preferences they can rate with like five stars say so then itll itll each add up to like twentyfive total per like item and then say like the system will just sort through everyones like numbers and then figure out like whats at the top
wait where the hell were
no no no
they will add up everyones number like per item
but
but that would mean they would have to look at the same items
but what happens if their preferences are differen
like you cant like yeah
be well the thing is like its okay if their preferences are different
like
but then you end up with getting data from some people and not getting data from others
like if if Aruna was the only one with allergies and shes the only one with allergies as a preference then she would rather not have something with cats and no one else puts down uh that they have a problem with cats
yeah you would be comparing apples and oranges
yeah you would only have one data point instead of five
oh crap Im speaking with a stats
but I think that like price is like you know like quantitative enough that we can actually like
I think price and location
those this I thought should be just separate like because it seems like thats something everyone would like care about
yeah so like
like I think it should just be like a thing you can filter or sort by
sort by price or by like distance
or and then like maybe filter by method of delivery
you know what it could d
if other people enter in like price and like location thing so while you visit like craigslist it could just like show you next to every item be like Aruna would like this couch because it fits like in her price range
or like if if something doesnt fit it could just like like it could show a red I dont know cross and be like this couch is I dont know not in Arunas price range so it would just like not look at that one
okay well but then then again like when Aruna can compromise
yeah because the thing is that she only compromises when because it is a group decision
if shes the one buying the couch then allergies rank really really high
yeah but cause yeah because even when cat when Kate came in and started talking about oh this couch is nice but oh its got cats then Arunas like oh
well Arunas like well maybe because it has cats and a little damage we can you know compromise to get the price lower
jeff was like I dont like that
so like its kind of hard like unless they actually meet together like buy the thing like just like get together as a group its kind of hard to like unless they have like real time discussion
how are we going to like simulate tha
build a community around this
well could you do something like how google notebook how you record the site or the link or whatever and then you can put a comment but then like within our site you can like search a key word and it will bring up all of the links that people have posted with that key word in the comment
so you can see like what she says like I like the color and price or whatever
then if you type in color or something you can see like what couches people mentioned
but like what if she says I dont like the colo
its going to come up with
yeah but then you get to at least see that she doesnt like this color and you can see which ones she does like the color and which ones she doesnt like the color so when you are looking you have the knowledge of oh Arunas
or you gotta have like two different like tagging fields like positive negative and you can just like drag color into positive
then that will take time
fitts law
but it would be like really convinient
because then you actually have to drag stuff into boxes
rather than telling someone hey I dont like that color
which ones faster entering it in or like dragging i
it depends on how big the box and target youre looking at
you are the equation
but what if people just prefer dragging though no matter how long it take
the we have to study that
uh where I guess we can have positive and negative fields
its a good idea
wait so are we making the users enter in their preferences beforehan
I think that thats a good idea
uh what are like the preferences were havin
price range
well it seems like because each item that they might be shopping for could be drastically different it seems like we have to let them as a community which preferences they want
so its not going to be set
but like okay we have to have like a set of preferences that theyll pick from
yeah basic all like when
but why thoug
but like how how are we gonna how are we gonna have people entering in their preferences if we dont like set up the stuff for the
like say say like
theyre not programmers
theyre not able to
each person enters in five top preferences and then those er wait I dont know and then you consolidate it into a list and then theyll like figure out which ones most important which ones least important
but like think of it like though implementing the perspective like
itll just be by the value
you know like you could designate price as like ten and then location as nine blah blah blah and then depending on the importance it can probably be bigger
but like if you dont set up the uh implementation for entering in the price range
like suppose that theres nothing set up like how how is a not programmer person going to be able to like set up a preference and have it like implemented in the thin
like am I making sens
like
yeah youre talking about having predefined stuff versus uh something new that you have to code up
yeah you have to have like some sort of options that their like gonna pick from
could we like technically just not have them do preference
cause I mean like if they leave a comment obviously you dont have to leave a comment
but if they do decide to leave a comment theyre probably going to mention why they dislike or liked a couch and within that like if someone says that they like the price you can go to that couch and see the price that they liked and be like okay they like at least
so thats like google notebook then
it is like google notebook slightly but we have to like umm change it to make it more community based
well you can umm compilate preferences on the fly based on selection
yeah thats possible
so if a like say if you bought if you looked at a couch and you rated it maybe a two out of five the its gonna lo then is gonna so so
its gonna look to the page to find the price
look through the page find the key points try to correlate that with other choices youve made in the past and then when someone else is looking at that page you know you can have like maybe a small bar on the top that says you know ah like John would like this Annie might not like this based on past references
the only problem with that is that its it doesnt give you a list of what the people are looking for
could you
but it could like you can once you figure out what people like you can just make it like spit out like you know how pandora does
just like John prefers couches like you can say like according to my calculations
john prefers couches within this price range
he prefers couches around Shadyside and this color
that way the problem with that approach right generating the list of preferences based purely on observation is that what happens if I show you a really really cheap couch that you would like based on price but you hate the color and to you color ranks more than price righ
so you rank you rate it like a two out of five even though if it was a color that you liked you would have rated it a five
so right now the system would look at it and say he doesnt like this couch because the price is two hundred is one hundred dollars and the color is green
so you end up with false data
couldnt you do somethign like
could you also support the explicit data entr
well you can I guess
you just need to figure out how it fits into the work flow
well what about something like you know google notebook how you can highlight the link and then click the add button
well what if you could also have other features where you could like highlight the price and then there would be a dropdown list and you can say price and then it will record that price
like so instead of having to enter something like manually the things you like about it or dislike about it you can be like it will have a drop down menu and you can be like like and then it will have another dropdown menu and you can be like price and then you could like highlight the color and be like dislike and then like color
that would be kind of cool
like that would be really cool
it would be really time consuming but it would probably be faster than entering the data trhough keystrokes
it wouldnt be that time consuming either like you could just have something like you know once you like once you highlight this it just shows like like and dislike
and then you click on one of them and it has everything
its like you dont have to like click you can just pull your mouse over the
yeah kind of like any thing like up here
it has
yeah kind of like up here where it has like and arrow and then you can click on one of these
yeah
you can actually save time by not highlighting
just right click over the word and then you can generate an n best list
yeah yeah
Im sorry
Im sorry man
you just said n best list
ok so Ill just record
um
what were we talking abou
I was gonna check the kernal spec
I cant figure out any of them that get past the tid other than
a pcp
oh pc pid
pid yeah sorry
yeah I did a search and theres no pid in the whole thing
like the letters p i d
um
this but
exec yields sleep none of those have pids
doesnt have a pid just a status pointer
oh by the way it turns out status is an integer not a
yeah I noticed that
yeah so I changed that
well then what about your tcbs like
tid
when youre vanishing and youre not the last
yeah
thread
yeah
cant someone try to look you up while your vanishing
yea
um but when do you want to look someone up for yield
as so many times were passing in a t and castwoi runflag only two times righ
yup
at which point in time what happen
you either get put into a queue um or youre in a queue
but if youre in a queue then youre not in vanish
right
or no you might be in a queu
in which case they just yell to you when you finish vanishing
Im worried about times when you have to look up somebody
mmhm
and work with them but theyre tcbs been freed or something like that
well we remove it from the hashmap before its freed
yeah what if I look it u
then it yields to us or somehow some sort of vanish
or if theyre looking it up while we are removing it from the hashma
but then thats just a hashmap block
I think we should definitely lock the hashmap both maps
well
if we wouldnt set up doing the scheduler I suppose if we cant switch out from the scheduler
mmhm
so theres really no waste conditions with the scheduler and other things
actually no there are
because the other processes other processors
yeah
um but the p has a mutex inside of the um scheduler
so we cant lock up the
oh hm
I mean if we use the processor a lot
hm
but
uh definitely think that we should lock it
uh
because if youre in the middle of removing and then you get a timer interupt and someone else tried to yield to you
hm slightly tricky
that was good sushi by the way
thanks
um I mean it wasnt good just delicious
oh ok
um hm so theres really two places we look up tids
castwoi and in uh scheduler
schedule
and both are locked both have a processor lock and the other no contact switch lock so in this case all we have to worry about is other processors doing stuff at the same time
mmhm
so what if we lock the add and the remove with a processor lock
Im fine with that
um
the only thing is if we lock add or remove with a processor loc
yeah
um when we go to remove uh we havent been through the scheduler yet so were not like scheduling locked and so we get a processor lock on that remove and that map righ
mmhm
and then we go to uh we get a timer interupt which then tries to schedule
we also I we also have the disabled context switch
we also do dis so we disable context switch during any operations to the
Im tempted to always link those together but there are cases where you dont really link them together
but yeah yeah in that case they would be grouped together so we need a functional law
yeah that would be fine for that
eh Im really okay with it
okay
yeah
um do you interface a bunch of fails with vanishe
standardin n
because the errors that Ive been running into with Simics now you know just during debugging
I havent really started to debug yet
I took me a bit of time to get everything up
I mean I do have a bunch of vanishes like in the exception handlers
in exception handlers okay that could
in the page fault general protection fault all the exceptions um except for page fault all the other exceptions will kill the process which includes a vanish
yeah because um Simics when it crashes theres its a triple fault handler and them some like idt like two hundred seventy or something like that
some really high number
really
and Im like huh
wait is i
maybe two hunrded and thirty
triple fault reall
um so
yes it does vanish inside of exception file exception handler
but thats so weird that it would treat
slightly weird
oh something else is um
Im thinking hang on this are tcb and pcb the design decisions for those have they been locked dow
mmhm
we kinda have code around that you know that initializes them and changes values
and that feels slightly dangerous
okay
I dont know
I mean its not so many that I feel like we actually needed like initialize tcb thing but
it just
like right now tcbs are only created in two places thread fork and the initial
not thread fork just fork
tcb
oh you said bcps
sorry I meant to say tcb
okay
tcbs are in uh third fork and
and the initial
initial and pcbs are in fork and initial
right
and thats probably not going to change
hm
okay
thats cool
das ist cool
hm
yeah that shouldnt change
triple fault thats weird
because like theres a bunch of different things that could cause a triple fault but
hm
I mean the weird thingy is that its it seems like its trying to access uh the index the iut is using ≋
mhmm
is way out of bounds not way out of bounds but its like two hundred and something
which is not
is it two two somethin
wait is it an id
did it say idt or does it say like ldt or gd
idt
and does it say general protection faul
maybe
yeah thats my code prints out general protection fault uh that means that someone sent a int with the idt out of range
yeah yeah thats right
and that idt is printed in hex
its in he
oh thats really out of range then
yeah I think thats Im not sure where thats coming from
I think it might be coming from a vanish
is it two two zer
I think so yeah
thats coming from
is it whenever you call shel
or whenever you set up the in
I was getting the exact same thing
alright
I was getting
well
I dont know which one that was from
I initially I was the one that set up the pcb correctly in um the initial setup
okay
so anything and actually no it would get it
it was weird what happened was
so I forgot I didnt do that correctly
so I didnt setup who the queues correctly
mmhm
and uh I would get into a infinite loop in the memory management where it would uh it would get the pde
mmhm
and then it would check it to see its valid
and it would dereference it
that would cause page fault
and eventually that would
and it would skip the call to pde
ah because it tries to dereference a pde which the pde should be in kernal memory but we dont check
I should check and make sure the pde is in kernal memory
okay
thats what the problem is there
I mean fixing the init is fix that
maybe we should make a note of that just so we dont forget it
yeah
we should like record our conversations you know
so that we can just play them back later as notes
yeah we should definitely listen to them
thats true
rip off Megan having to listen to us now
hi Megan
um
dududu
lets vote and just
oh woah
that guy just did an amazing dive
oh so the ide check in to make sure its in bound
pde
oh pde sorry
pde
okay
yeah I should probably go over page faults with a fine tune comb
so that we make sure that everything is safe
you dont run end up in an infinite loop like that
Im trying to nap safe for now
like I checked stock
I check tcb in there
one to get its pcb I check its pcb
yeah
min
we should make a corrupted kernel stack or something like that uh just to like check
mmhm
because this seems to be like common checks like check tcb then pcb maybe even throwing in a canary in too
a canar
um a static integer where you put at the beginning of a structure
oh
and at the end of the structure just to make sure it hasnt been written over
thats interesting
Ive never heard of that
what would we define it to b
just something really weird that wouldnt come up normally
well that might not come up normally
it would just be a random integer
hm
like canaries in the land mine or uh not land mine
in a
in a yeah
man I wish that uh
was that hexidecimal that you used for the seventee
because then you could spell Gabe
dead Gabe
or Gabe beef
Gabe beef thatd be cool
um
yeah
yeah
so the like seventy pages of Japanese culture reading I did last night
uhhuh
turned out to be the wrong reading
oh no
I mean it was necessary
its just we were supposed to read an article or something for today
uhhuh
so oh well
oops
it took me seven hours
I cant read
anyway so um
I know the feeling I cant do any of that kind of stuff
so if I have two mutexes and wait no
I added one mutex and one semafor
there already was one mutex for page the pages in the pcb
yes
I added the mutex for queue
okay
you know to for adding those queues and added a semafor which is signal in you know in vanish
yeah
um yeah and that seemed to make sense
when I add somebodys when someones when I read chil
mmhm
um I add its semafor to ours
okay
I go through each of the lists and I change each of the childrens parent to bs
oh okay
and then I add them onto our lists
okay that makes sense
not in that order but thats basically what I do
yeah
I mean first I change their parent
oh wow a bunch of stuff is an illegal memory reference now
yeah the we have to explicitly check for null
when we compute the address of a struct and stuff like that
oh my god
also he thought about that case that I was saying that array
right
where if you allocate like an array of arrays
okay
and you get a bunch of null array pointers thats invalid so
yeah
yeah so whenever we
so in the IR there are a bunch of places where I get the address of something
and after I get that we just have to check for null
well
you can just read from the address to do an implicit check
I guess
you can
like a compare
yeah
there might even be an instruction cuz its six eighty six like check this address
oh like die if its null
yeah
um
whatever we can do that in the end
what was that case you were talking about using a conditional move for
um for array bounds checking
so like instead of doing index is less than zero jump to thing that seg faults do compare
and then like compare with zero
and then C move less than something into dereferencing null
oh okay yeah
so if its less than zero itll try to move something at to into null
otherwise itll be fine
and that will make the control flow a lot better
okay
itll also make the instructions shorter
right
um
thats why it itll be much more efficient if we dont have it completely in the IR
oh also allocation with new tau of N for N less than zero must fail
what what does it do now if you try to do that
like new int brackets minus one
itll
what does it do
I think so it itll just itll call calloc with minus one
oh wouldnt it
but calloc is
calloc is a signsig
signsig its is unsigned isnt i
so that would be
so it would be something ginormous
yeah
it would be ≋
hhh
the max int
okay
uh which is
two to the thirty one minus one
at least
well
times the size of the object so for an int if you do new int minus one it would be sixteen gigs and that would just fail
well no sixteen gigs cant
oh no size T is sixty four bits isnt it
no he said it was thirty two
what
I thought it was the machine word size
well in the handout it said that we should assume that size T is unsigned int
that doesnt make a whole lotta sense
I know but thats what he said
Im pretty sure thats wrong actually
it could be
I remember I tried looking once
anyway um so this array layout stuff that weve already pretty much figured that out
um so I guess the implication is that the typechecker should catch extern functions with array return types
cuz that doesnt go
I think so
theres a whole section on that
it just the array layout section
yeah
it just says arrays generated by C cannot be returned to L five
blah dee blah
so it doesnt say what to do
so its unspecified
it doesnt say what to do about it
so its unspecified
yay
unspecified behavior um
right so these optimizations
um most of I say we d ehh huh
weve already done a couple of them
weve already done instruction selection all right
yeah parts of it
wait aligning jump targets
seriously
um generating good code for conditions or loops
aligning jump targets
you can do that with an assembler directive you can be like dot align four
so that doesnt cost us anything so lets just do that
yeah
so anyway weve already done most of that generating good code for conditions and our loops already make sense
um
I dunno if we were really brave we could try like using L E A for certain types of multiplication and addition
yeah that should be it could be a uh final pass thing on the assembly
well it depends on all the operands being registers
so I mean as long as I the code is generated in a consistent manner we can look for certain patterns
right well I mean for something like an expression two times X plus one that can be turned into an L E A but thats like that might not be recognizable in the assembly
yeah I dont know
Im sure that the register allocation in G C C is really complicated because for s things like that itll r realize that if those are registers then it can be faster
I dont really want to know how bad G C C is
uh constant folding and propagation I think we should do that one cuz some of the other ones are really nasty dead code elimination we can do that one
common subexpression elimination I dont want to do that
yeah how many do we have to pick from that list
three
so weve already got one of um and I say j I just say we do constant folding and dead code elimination
well we kind of so we have instruction selection but we also kind of have eliminating register moves improve instruction selection
really
well thats like the first thing on the list
well no thats different
there was one thing I did to improve instruction selection for ifs and then the other thing I did to improve instruction selection
oh yeah the munching into a specific thing thing um okay
so we can look at maybe doing register coalescing
whate whatever if its in the notes then fine but I dont wanna have to figure it out
yeah also size T is long unsigned int
so thats sixty four bits
what is he smoking
I dunno
look on the fish machines
find the file
what its oh but it has to be sixty four bits
that doesnt make any sense its like the size of a thing in memory which could be sixty four bits
and like if its sixty four on mine itll be sixty four
it does not make any sense
the whole point of sixty four bit is so you can have stuff thats whatever
so then negative one as an unsigned sixty four bit int is what four gigs
terabytes
er no
four gigs squared
no sk squared no its
its so minus one interpreted as unsigned is two to the thirty one no its yeah
two to the sixty five minus one its sixty four bit
what no minus oh y oh so thats two to the thirty two minus one
sixty four bits of all ones
no it depends on what your it depends on what size the assembler thinks it is cuz doesnt our code just put it in the assembly as minus one
so that would make it sixty four bits of ones wait no it doesnt it passes as a thirty two bit
it passes it as thirty two bits to calloc
yeah
well then itll be two to the thirty two
minus one times
the size of the stuff
so two to the thirty is one gig
two to the thirty two minus one is about four gigs
so its four gigs times the size of the thing
yeah so if its an int its sixteen gigs
whatever it
the point is that doesnt make sense
ah thats disgusting though so like every time you realize how many like conditionals and stuff are gonna end up in this
well for all of this we basically just seg fault if its broken so we could just use the C move thing
yeah I guess but still
so we can add a new I R thing thats like if this condition is true seg fault
every time you dereference an array
thats bad
well every other language does it
I suppose
um anyway other optimizations
what other ones are there
um constant propagation
thats part of constant folding
um I dunno my main concern is how were gonna come up with three to five pages
I know like these are pretty well defined things
I could Im pretty sure I could go on for like half a page about the munching thing
the if thing was like just obvious
so um
and remember I said about the if thing early on I was like why dont you use this um
the jump less than or equal whatever
yeah I know
you were like nnn
I just forgot how awesome pattern matching was
okay
oh should describe each optimization how you implemented it any heuristics you developed for its application and whether you found it to be effective both on contrived examples and the provided benchmark suite
he didnt provide us a benchmark suite
whatever
seriously
maybe when he releases the tests
also maybe we can just make a thing thats only effective on contrived examples
yeah
Right so the background for this is that its for my child psych class
and these are qu these are questions that Ive written based off the suggestions that um were given for the paper assignment
Um so for all these questions please keep in mind how you would answer them specifically in terms of your own childhood slash how you were raised or you intend to raise your own children and how you see children being raised in society as a whole
those a those are the three things you should keep in mind
but otherwise its quite straightforward
but otherwise its quite straight forward exactly ha ha ha
so question one how do you see nature that is genetic makeup and nurture physical and social environment contributing to a childs developmen
nature and nurture not nature or nurtur
you can treat is as an and or question if you would like
theyre fairly open to interpretation
well I see both of them making a contribution
and uh especially the oh the nurture the environment or lack of it
hh hh hh
children coming from a good home versus a socalled broken home children with access to good food and good education versus no access
so I think it makes a tremendous difference in how the child turns out
ok excellent
question two is what do you think influences the development of specific traits such as athletic ability food preference choice of friends and intellectual abilit
oh boy
well lets see choice of foods and friends is mostly what you grow up with
you eat what your parents eat or what youre forced to eat
Um you may be influenced by your friends in the sense of being introduced to junk food for example
but again a lot of the primary influence is you either get good or bad eating habits from your immediate home environment
um athletic ability thats a tougher one
Well basically the question is looking for whether or not you think its something that is inherantly biological or something that you acquire through social interaction or environmental factors
I dont think people are born athletes
Certainly if you decide to become an athlete of a particular kind your genetic makeup will help in a sense youll have longer legs or good bones or whatever but if you dont have parents who are willing to encourage the ability or if you dont have access to a running track or a gymnasium or whatever it is the environment counts for a lot
mm
in my own mind Im an olympic gold medalist
hh hh hh indeed you are
right so what childrearing practices do you view as most and least effective in terms of discipline encouragment etc what is the right role for a parent to play in a childs lif
most effective leading by example
least effective coercion by punishment
very concise wow
°so Dad°
°whered you go
I should say most effec or least effective coercion by reward and punishment
ok Ill add that Um but in terms of then discipline what how do you see discipline working the
aaah Most effective least effectiv
yea
aah
that looks ridiculous hh hh
the village stocks
I know right
I mean you didnt beat the crap out of me when I was little
right and I never once felt I had to either but why I mean I cant re
well I mean cuz we were talking about it in class like different different methods of discipline different methods of enforcing rules in a house and I mean howhow do you communicate to a child this is how we do things in this house and if you dont do things this way this is the consequenc
I mean ok well it doesnt even have to be specific to me as a kid like what how do you see like an ideal scenario like that playing ou
if you if if the kids not allowed to put their feet on the chair like what how do you communicate to them they cant do tha
do you like scream at them do you hit them do you say Ill give you a candy bar if you dont do that like
I think no its I would say explain the reason for it
I mean those are all ridiculous extremes but yknow
and try to get the kid to understand why that thats rule exists I mean the last thing you want is thats the law because I said so
ok
right ok so no handing down of ha ha commandments
no as they say no appeals to authority
∬hes ironing right now by the way just for the record thats why he keeps disappearing he just put away the ironing board and were at Paps∬
thats easier said than done of course
ok so the next question is do you believe that children learn more from their peers or from older children and adult
oh I think they learn more from their peers simply because their peers are the ones they associate with most and however well aah I mean obviously you learn from your parents
you learn the roles from your parents you learn the interesting stuff from your peers hh hh and for older children naaah I dont know I dont think I uh it depends on how yeah Id say more peers
mkay hoooo lets see This is the one for you
No actually thatt the next one my bad um what changes in childrearing practices have you witnessed across generation
so it was primarily for Pap that one but
well for my wha
well for my generation there were certain things that you did that brought out the leather strap
jumping on the bed was one I can speak to personal experience from there ehm
ooh that was administered by your da
yea but I think sometimes my mother but usually my dad
and then of course there was the corporeal punishment in schools with the the cane
and was that at the Christian school or
well theyre all Christian in Ireland so
thats true k
well there was a oh no nuns no teachers this was a this was at the boys national school so that want run by a religious organization
but they wouldve been brothers handing down the whacking or nuns or just teacher
and what kinda things would you get caned for and like to what exen
God
Um not doing your homework or answering questions incorrectly when you should know them
god
yea when youre supposed to learn something about a subject and you might get away with one or two wrong answers but if youre consistantly
and it was a han
yea six
Si
if it was really bad I dont think I ever got six but six of the best it used to be called
god whatd the cane look lik
it looked like a walking stick but made of really skinny bamboo so it would go whshew
oh god
would sting when it came down
it was a very skinny walking stick flexible
and why the han
and if it had followed that trajectory we would now have an advanced design carbon fiber model
tscheehehe Shing shing
oh brother
and why the han
because it was easier than the buttocks hh hh
ok so have you noticed any cultural differences in the ways that children are raise
Mister resident alien
oh I dunno if its cultural so much as generational the fact that when Im in a restaurant and I see the parents the Yuppie parents smiling indulgently as their little brat almost goes headfirst through a display case hh hh
it doesnt have to be I mean just you
hh hh theres where the leather strap might be appropriate hh hh
oh look little Benjamin is shitting on the floor
hh hh ha
how cute its in the form of a heart
oh my god
hes not stealing hes expressing his desire for more treats
tyha
no but I mean you say that but you didnt beat the shit out of me when I was little so
but you werent a monster for some reason
an I think part of it was you learned to talk very early on and we could communicate with you I think its a big differencewe never had the Terrible Twos bebecause you could talk well before two and
that is true I think I mean it really does play a big role
see you shouldve had a nother one then it would all have been different
its not that there wer its not that there werent some battles but it was just yknow I heard the horror stories from other people because I think they were just trying too hard
they had this idea that
although I mean thertherere kids who cant actually produce speech themselves but theythey still undoubtedly understand a lot of what youre saying so it is possible to reason with them even if they cant respond to you in words but I still definitely think it makes it more difficult yeah
alright nearly there um have you noticed any sex differences in the way that children are raise
not apart from the the stereotypical stuff you know the boys play with the tanks and guns and the girls play with the dolls because thats what people will give them
the same thing with dressing them
but in terms of attitudes of parents towards the children disciplinewise chores career encouragement that kind of thing no difference
I cant say I have because I havent really paid attention to what other people do unless theyre blatantly setting the child up to be a psychopath in later life
ok and I mean if you reflect on your own childhood though I mean obviously I know the way that you guys raised me I wasnt told that I was destined to be a secretary or whatever but um I mean the way when you were growing up did you notice differences in the way that boys and girls were raise
um∬I cant say that I did but they were probably there I just never if theres anything to it Im oblivious∬
ok nnnuh thats fine
alright and the last one is comparing two like the most prominant theories of this type of child development theres stage theories and continuous development thetheories
and so stage theories the kind of dumbeddown explanation is that children go through distinct stages as they mature and they have to be ready to be ready to move out of one stage before they can go on to the next one Piaget
yea
um and the continuous development is that children gradually learn new things as they mature and kind of master each task as they go that theres no specific stage
specific stage
and so my last question for you is which one of those theories do you think most accurately represents your views and why would you say tha
thats funny because well yea when we we talk theres a thing included in some topic of computer science called process improvement
its an essay question
hh hh
and there are process improvement models that have been put out by the guy who died recently Ross Hunter and theres a stage model that he used
hh thats funny
and there are computing theories about you know this company in that stage one stage two stage three whereas this one is yea theyre doing a little bit of this but here theyre doing that from a higher level
but in that model theyre two things that can coexis
uum
because the the the proponents of the two respective theories are like bitter enemies in psychology and
yea I think well
theyre not in this yea
yea I mean they ththe the stage theories came first so continuous development references stage theories even though they dont agree with it theyre like oh well you see suchandsuch a kid is obviously exhibiting elements of this stage but also of this stage but they dont actually believe in the concept of stages
so I think its more two models that
Whereas Piaget in the stage theories idea was really hardcore about like you have to have accomplished all of these developmental milestones within this stage before you can move on
Doesnt correspond to age II mean it roughly does but ththe individual markes are the things that you gave gone through the things that you have mastered and until you have done all of them you are stuck in whatever stage
yea but not but not necessarily
ah I mean so its its
so which one of those would you go fo
well the problem is its never an eitheror
well yea I mean I understand that but like or dyou have any kind of leavnings or or you just ambivalent about i
I duno I think practically I would just with continuous but the uh I can certainly see how there are some adults that they may be chronologically adults but theyre still teenagers
ok so thats thethe stuck in one stage kind of ide
yea
mkay well unless you have anything that you would like to add or things that you think I left out or whatever then that the end of the questions
any other profound words for posterit
hh hh that will be immortalized in this four page fantastic documen
hh hh
shit you could write a book about any one of those questions
I know well I mean
I kind of did more for these questions than was necessary for the assignment because they give you like two example questions in the assignment and they say like talk to your parents and your and your grandparents or whoever in your family about these issues and make sure to involinclude mention of nature versus nurture and continuous versus discontinuous development in your analysis they didnt say
try to get the essence of it yea its
soo um yea
tsk right
well this is good because Mam is not here and I was hoping I was gonna have an opportunity to do the two of you separately because I figured if I did both of you at the same time you would pollute each others responses
And then its I mean its hard enough to get down one persons responses if your trying to write two peoples different responses at the same time youd go crazy
ah yea thats better to have yea
ooh my god
this call is now being recorded
hello
hell
hi mom did it tell you that the call was being recorde
ya whats going o
ok good its working
I have to do an assignment for Language and Thought where I have to record a telephone record a conversation and then transcribe it
so do you have ten minute
I dont have ten minutes right now can I call you bac
a little bit late
ya I have
work in two and a half hours
in how long do you when do you wor
from ten to two
oh ok so can I call you like in a half an hou
ya
ok
bye
bye
Google Voice this call is now being recorded
hello
hi brent
hi mom
how can I help yo
ok so so I have to do this transcription for language and thought
ok
worth ten percent of my grade
alrighty
have a ten minute conversation and then transcribe it
so what are you doin
Im sitting here watching the
I was asleep
and now Im awake
and Im watching the city council meeting
so what do you have t
come on
ask me the questions
there is no questions we have to have a conversation
oh
for ten minutes
theres no survey or anything
oh ok
well thats easy
yep
how are yo
good
how are your classes goin
good
I have a test a final tomorrow and a paper due on Thursday another paper due on Friday
and then a final on Monday
good for you well youre in college
thats what youre sposta to be doing
I talked to the guy who wrote my recommendation for law school
he said the same thing you did about the personal statement
dont apologiz
ya about my GPA
ya you just say that you enjoyed doing other things
stop apologizing just say I had an interesting experience in college
I started a business and a charity
look what I did
isnt this interestin
did you read th
I read your revision
I still thought that you apologized too much
reall
uh huh
ya your revision needs a revision
is that o
ok
how come you were sleepin
I was on call last night honey
wheres Willso
hes right next to me
on the be
on the bed and
he wants special dog jammies for Christmas
oh Willson
so what are we gonna d
if we have
five people but only four
ticket
for the Redskins gam
I dunno
hows the fraternity hous
its good
hows the roommat
hes good
hows The Dud
hes good
he survive
hes good he was
supposed to live in the desert
they dont always have food
supposed to go through feasts and famine
ya
we had a meeting tonight
for two hours
a fraternity meetin
ya
where do you sit in the meetin
hu
do you sit towards the bac
or towards the fron
in the back
oh gosh
dads listening to a lot of people talking at the city council meeting
a woman in a cowboy hat
abou
I dunno what theyre talking about
medical office buildings
I dunno what she has to say
I thought they already made the decision on tha
I dunno
Is it about the parking or somethin
its about something like
limiting the medical offices in the city
but it was so interesting that I fell asleep and then you called
and Im awake again to listen to it
local politics
its important
how do you transcribe laughin
do you say hah
I think Im supposed to leave it out
you still have to send your essay to Willie for him to help you just add his opinion
I dont know how to change it any more to make it less apologizing
well first off you dont have to say it so much
youre redundant
Im gonna print the essay and then Im gonna talk with you about
how I would rather you state things cuz there was certain things that I could see
that entire sentences should be omitted
reall
yep
o
ok
Im tired now
I need to go
to bed
ok bye
bye
wh
what was up earlie
just the people that were around us I was like oh my god that douchebag motherfucker
wait who was i
oh just cause like every time jarrett is in the room like just the sound of his voice grates on my nerves
and Im just like you speak like a tool
and you look like a tool
if it sounds like a tool and looks like a tool
and from what I learned in school about ducks leads me to believe that you are a tool
if it walks like a duck
possibly also a douche
maybe a bitch
you dated him
you know wha
way to throw that back in my face
lets use my track record to indicate that that means nothing
way to throw that back in my face you sick twat
I love you
dont you even
were done here
were done
well who have you date
wha
dont even
I mean Im pretty sure that Jon qualifies as a pretty big tool
I love how shes like who have you date
not goingto lie
yep
I mean you know
that was really bad
you sortof didnt realize it at the time
this table seems really depressing all of a sudden
I like this table
this tables the best
she has a successful relationship under her belt
you sick bitch
my boyfriends great
weve been dating for three and a half years
you know wha
were going to get married
oh that doesnt mean anything trust me
I have a cock you can suck on
oh no we have a great culture of mutual love and respect
its good stuff
is that code for good sex or just good drug
Im going to transcribe all of this
its going to be great
please do
please
oh my God I want this to show up in a paper for MacWhinney
it will
is he seeing this transcriptio
by the same token
Ill keep my comments to a minimum
hell be in debt until hes like forty five
wha
by the same token hell be in debt until hes like forty five
lifes a tradeoff
you kno
life is a fun time
its a fun time
I didnt want to come back here so badly
I was just like wrestling with the idea of just not taking my finals like
yeah
I was like how much would that hurt m
Id probably get a d in everything but I think I could handle that
I think if I just stopped now I wouldnt fail anything but I would just
oh wait
okay I might get like a c in something
oh no youd fail this
youd fail this
this whole project is worth like seventy percent of our grade
oh that is true
that is true
wha
what project is i
for research methods
for research methods in cognitive psych we have to like design a project an experiment do it and then present it and then write a paper on it
the project is legitimately worth like all of our grade
and so far weve just done the project
well all aspects of the project
like the paper itself the presentation
what was your project o
we were looking at the possible existence of internet language as a separate lexicon such that it hinders comprehension when you switch from internet lexicon to standard written English
its true
basically Facebook makes you dumber
it happens
which I think is our tagline
but we didnt find anything that suggests it happens but basically were just attributing that to our really really poor protocol
and our really really terrible participants
yeah
some of which were on acid
Kelly was honestly on acid when she did this experiment
I wasnt on acid
you were not but Kelly Im pretty sure was on acid
yeah
that would follow
actually
you sick bitch
wha
you read things no
this is long as a cock
a long cock
I was like that could be one of many lengths
that sounds like a type of bird
this is gonna be a stellar transcript
the big kind
so excited
by the way
its only like three inches
Im really looking forward to it
wha
oh
its only like three inches
oh I thought you meant cocks
he was like thats only three inches
I was like
I was like Andrew what i
Im sorry
thats less than three inches
whoa
yeah
fun fact
this is too
no Im kidding
thatd be sad
hand points
thats how youll transcribe that
ampersand equals hand points
just FYI
how long do you think its going to be before everyone in this entire area hates u
I mean whatever
they were laughing as loudly over there
I cant wait until we replay it
Im hungry for you
we were having a conversation like at minimal
who were we sitting nea
oh no
those two bitches and the girl was like
and then they talked twice as loud as us like ten minutes later
and they kept like staring at us all the time
and then I was like you sick dirty bitches
and then they said terrible things about what they did in high school
like you think cause youre a freshman that I care about yo
like
no
like Im sorry Im not like
and how they got out of cheating in high school
yeah she was just like
what was she talking abou
she was like
she just didnt hand in papers
she was like I didnt hand in the paper but I was like
oh she was like I didnt hand in the paper but I like emailed the professor and I was like hey I just wanted to make sure that you have my paper because my computer crashed and like I dont have a copy anymore so like I just really want to make sure that you have my paper
and then the teacher
shes like and then the teacher emailed me back
hes like oh I seem to have lost it but Ill just give you a b
or like an a
and shes like I didnt even turn in that paper
im like you are a dirty sick bitch
please go to Pitt
like dont go to my school
fo sho
im gonna pee on you
you dont belong here
you dont
you dont belong here
you do not belong
no
no
well she wont last long
she really wont
if she keeps up that attitude
sick bitch
yeah i wonder how shes doing so far
CMU eats people like that up and spits them out
hope shes failing
oh i have
fricking i have so many students in my psych class that are like really bright and just dont try worth balls
and its really obvious
and Im just like fuck you
you know wha
theres a bunch of people who arent as smart as you and try really hard
that would be Scott
that would be me
that would go
yeah fuck you you sick bitch
I wonder how many times Ive said that so far
youll have to see in the transcript how many times Ive said you sick bitch
at least three
oh Veronica Im sorry
I really dont care
Im working
Im gonna transcribe whatever the fuck I get
itll be awesome
youll have the best transcription
my this is gonna be a metatranscription
Im gonna be transcribing about transcribing
transcribing about tran meta
I like the meta
friggin also im supposed to be drinking for someones birthday right now and thats not happening
all we talk about is work anyway
whose birthda
Vicky
oh reall
Yuh Vicky Yuh
she is turning twenty one and I was invited to her party
initially I RSVPed yes
I dont know anyone whos not twenty one yet
I feel like I was the youngest person out of everyone I knew
um
Im not twenty one
wait are you a junior or a senio
shes a junior
Im a junior
there ya go i
Vickys a
Vickys a ju senior and shes not twenty one
I dont turn twenty one until Im a senior
Fay I dont believe is twenty one yet
Fay Ka Fay is her name Ha
Fays not twenty on
I feel like I forgot her last name
no I forgot her last name too because you did that
now I think its Han
no I think it might be I think its Han
it might be okay
Im reading this
Im reading this
In recent years a new form of written English language has emerged
neoEnglish i like that
reminds me of neoNazi
I dont thats what we want people drawing comparisons between
shh
or The Matrix
lets think The Matrix
and that works cause its technology
specific platforms
lets just turn it change everything from internet lexicon into Keanu Reeves from that point forward entirely
wait I should edit this
yeah go for it
give me the bread
fuck I cant really eat this
you should have seen him
like he was trying to grade a paper and hed get through a sentence and hes just reach over and like subconsciously grab the bread and hed be like no I cant eat
no not until after the paper
and then I still didnt finish the paper
cause yall bitches have been distracting me
I wuv you
aw
Im gonna pee on you
Scotts signs of affection
well ya know
Im just gonna nosh on this
Im just gonna make a CD called like the sounds of Scott
all Im saying is is if I die this year youll have a lot of key choices to paint on the Fence
and youd better show up
well just make you a second Fence
I will watch from below
oh please do
please just make me several Fences that will fit all of my witticisms
theyll have to like extend the Fence like forty feet into like the parking lot of Margaret Morrison
Ive already done the math
Scott with an exclamation point fits perfectly
on the posts
Scott
Scott
or Scott with like a cock
Scott
just draw a penis
be like Scott penis
and then it will be like actual size next to it
write that
and then people will think I died and it was tragic because I would have been such like a bounty for the porn industry
it would have been amazing
I cant believe youre not sharing your talent
what is thi
does anyone know what this i
wha
is it a bur
or like a spider bit
its too small to be a burn
I saw that Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhall movie
mhmm
which on
Love and Other Drugs
how was tha
how was tha
it was good
there was lots of naked
like lots
thats what I heard
it was awesome actually because he has a good ass
I will say this now
his ass
oh my God theres this one scene where just like they just stop having sex and he pulls back on his underwear but like only part way and then he like stands up because shes like okay you can go home now
hes like okay
and then just like underwear half on his ass
shirt like kinda tucked in
and like oh Jake Gyllenhall
you my child
Jake Gyllenhalls awesome
hes awesome in so many ways
although hes not Arabian or like Middle Eastern for that Prince of Persia
or British
that was
anything
Anne Hathaway
he keeps confusing his ethnicity
he thinks hes every ethnicity
well I dont know where the fuck Gyllenhall comes from
but let me tell you Anne Hathaway
sound Irish
she is a sexy bitch
she was naked for like a solid twenty minutes of that movie
at once or like
like you never actually saw her vagina but you almost saw her vagina like so many times
but like youre just like wow Anne Hathaway
you can do this
you can just be naked
good for you
good for you Anne Hathaway
I wish I was one of those people who could just like be naked
well whats it called
I watched I saw Megamind with uh
were they nake
no they werent but no Noah
I heard that sucked
actually it was good
is that the one with the blue hea
it was funny but it was not nearly as good as any of their other previous stuff
but I just saw it with Noah and the entire time he just screamed heteronormativity the entire movie
he would
I just wanted to punch him in the face after a while
like there was small children all over the place
whatever its a childrens movie
what does that even mea
its basically like portraying society in a way that like doesnt really allow for homosexuality
like that just implicitly or explicitly suggests that hetero is the only way to go
and hes just been using the word heteronormativity for anything that happens ever for the last like four months
heteronormative
and Im just tired of it
I mean
like Im
Im just like tired of his use of heteronormativity
oh my God
everything is heteronormative
Im just like yes
I realize that the world is a straight world and that its sad but you need to stop using that word before I punch you in the face
just pick a new word
there we go
headshot

I had a good one too

thats called being lucky
no its called
no like I was shooting for awhile
and its called knowing
called luck
its called luck
youre applying the law of large numbers
no no like
its not luck if you like
its luck if you flip a coin and get heads
that is how this game works
none of the guns are accurate enough after the first shot to not be luck
yeah
the AK is pretty accurate
the first shots accurate
the next ones arent
goddamnit Teisenbe
goddamnit Teisenbe
goddamnit Teisenbe

we all have shitty guns now
the FiveMGs arent that shitty
the PnineOs not that bad but the map
yeah this isnt a great map for it
the PnineO is
you you you dont need to get lucky at really long range
what are you doin
keep at a distance Keep the bots like completely you can aim by click click
keeping distance is not a good idea cause the bots have rifles
yeah but like if their if their back

so nothing can like pop out
I was so shocked but um did you like the movie yesterda
ya
what was your favorite par
I didnt see it i wish id gone
Tell joseph what happens
well um one thing happened was her hair um rapunzels hair was magic
magi
and then fling cut it off
fling is that the princ
His name is Flin
Tell the story of rapunzel
Rapunzel um the queen was sick and she was about to have a baby
yeah
and then there was what what made her feel bette
A flower drink
yep shampo
and then um
she felt better righ
yeah and then an old lady came and disguised as a mommy
whatd she do to rapunze
take her
took
and then so she grew up and every day on every year on her birthday she looked out the window and what did she s
lanterns
say wha
lanterns and her parents were like the prince the king and the queen and since they didnt know where their daughter was they like lit lanterns in the sky
And how old was she when she asked her mom to leav
eightteen
and whatd she d
go out
went out
she did a lot of things remembe
paint
she painted
what else
and there was a guy named pascal and like he was a little baby guy
yeah what did he d
and she played hide and seek
and that got her to it changes colors
thats not a gecko its a chameleon
chameleon um so so what happened when she asked her mom what did her mom say when she asked to leav
no
was she really mad or was she kind of ok with it
she was mad
yeah and heres a tough one
do you why did the mom the evil witch lady keep rapunzel in the towe
because she didnt want her to leave
yeah she didnt get it
its cause her hair had magic powers and when rapunzel sang to her mom she brushed her hair and her hair made her stay young because she actually was an old witch but she wanted to stay young and look young forever
she didnt get that
thats ok
um yeah um so how did she leave the towe
you already knew that part though
the the saying rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair
Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your gold hair
is there more than tha
i forget
I think thats it
So what kind so was the movie like animate

I dont even know
you dont know
thtats ok

yeah but i forgot
hh face smack

you do peter eyes you roll your eyes up like that peter doesnt even do that
pick any job for just one month what job would you hav
what job would you like to hav
assume that you would have the skills and knowledge to perform adequately
Well clearly
itd be a pretty terrible job if you couldnt perform it well
yea if you could do anything good for a month and afterwards you arent very good at it anymore so they have to fire you
my gut reaction is like astronaut
but I dont think thatd be that exciting of a job unless its the one month that youre out in space
yea well lets assume that youre out in space
I think that might be cool but astronauts do a lot of work
itd be cool for a day or maybe two but for a month they do a whole lot of work and experiments and have to be super disciplined
yea
maybe I would want to be a poker star
that would be a sweet job
because then you make a ton of money and its exciting
and
you get kind of famous
yea you get kind of famous some people know who you are get to hang out with other cool people and talk strategy
pretty good job
yea
I dont think well maybe being a sports player
but thats
yea again but I mean you can get most of the thrill of that by playing sports
yea
I mean playing them on a professional is cool and all but not really that much more exciting I dont think
no
other than the you know fame and forturne that goes along with it
yea
you could be like the head of a state for a month
I would not want to be that
thatd be hard
itd be incredibly hard and stressful
yea maybe thats not a good one
could be in charge of somethin
whats just a cool jo
um
I mean we skiped rock star
oh yea rockstar would be nice
thats a cool job you get to music all day meet a lot of sweet people everybody likes you
everybody that you meet likes you
baisically
that would be pretty cool
doesnt seem nearly as stressful as most of the other like fame jobs
yea could be a spy
wouldnt want to be a spy
I dont know if youre good at it you might like it
thats true
assuming that you can get dropped at the middle of a spy mission and already be you know knee deep so its not like youre just starting or something
fair enough
yea
um
lets try a new Chat Starter
okay
uh if you were required to wear a hat at all times what sort of hat would you wea

We shared we shared this one but to be fare we ate dinner really late
We were really hungry
You spent so much time on the road
You guys you get tired
Of course you get tired
It was so frustrating
Its tough No wonder
It was fine
I cried I laughed I sang a little
Thats when the traffic stopped
When you san
Wonder if theres a connection
So we started talking about uh that we started talking about the fact that were really enjoying operations and supply chain management
What do you mea
The class
Like the course
Oh the class ok
I started thinking maybe to do a phd in it and she asked me why
I said because then we could retire and open a consultant service and then we talked
Thats pretty close to what youre planning to do with the uh guy from MIT
Correct
Its not eh I dont know how it will work and whether something will come out of it
I understand
Thats ok
Hes not gonna do it for the money hes going to do it uhhh
So it means you like basically industrial engineering
Thats the bottom line
Hes so good at it
The professor says ok anybody here wants to answer apart from Eran
Eran already knows it
He actually said in the second lecture you can you cant answer any more you can teach the class
On what operation managemen
Supply chain management yea but uh
Lior is majoring in industrial engineering
Lior Koren
Lior Koren
Yes I know
In which school now Orego
Georgia Tech
In in Georgia Tech
You consider that majo
No one of our family friends daughters
Thats a thats a mighty good major at a mighty good school
What is he wait what is he doing her
She no Koren Lior Koren
Got it Im confused
From Massachusetts remember Pini and Einat Kore
Oh she got into Georgia Tech that gir
She also got into Carnegie Mellon but not the engineering school
Shes not doing very well
Reall
Yea thats what Einat said
Im surprised
She went Greek
She went Greek too
She went wha
Greek She joined a sorority
You want that phone instea
No I was wondering if you could see anything with the sticker
Why did you put the stickers ther
I dont know
We were bored one day
There were stickers
It doesnt take much
To entertain the cre
Look how nice my wallpaper is
Nice
Wanna see min
Sure
Did you see my new wallpape
Oh crap
Oh nice
I know these people
Did you see min
No
Oh nice
I know these people too
Are they the same peopl
Its the same people
Shocking
Its a different photo though
Yeah
One is from Cannon Beach
The other one is from I dont know where
South of Yellowstone
Yeah
The southern edge of Yellowstone
Right before you out of Yellowstone into
Tita
Oooh pretty
Great Titán
Thats a good picture
By the way we stayed at the the the the hotel in the Great Titán
And we we stayed in a cabin
Thats what we did back then
Its a beautiful view
We stayed in a cabin
Thats where we stayed
I dont remember
I believe you but I dont remember
I remember the cabin from the Great Canyon from the north rim
I dont remember that
I just remember we just remember going down
I remember going down going down a third of the way
I mean we we got up in the morning
A lot of stupid people
The kids no the adults
And then somebody said lets go down
Somebody said
Who di
Danny
Danny
Who els
Lets be honest
So we said Ok lets go down
Thats from the north rim
Thats higher than the south rim
So were going and going and going no water just really not ready with a bunch of little kids
Were going
Were going down into the Grand Canyon
Were just walking down
Got up in the morning were walking down
No food no wate
No Really
Are you seriou
Yea
Its ok its ok we never made it down
About a third of the way third of the way we got tired
We realized
No no no come on
Got tired going down and we realized that we still had to go everything we went down back up
A third of the way we realized that we were going down into the Grand fucking Canyon and there is a reason they put a grand before the name
It was amusing
Oh come on
It was better than the Vadi Kelt expedition
Yea but then we were ready
To what swim down the ehhhh river the river the stream
Yea with the camera camera got wet there
We were wading to a track down the eh the eh stream bed
Yea we go the camera got wet
Whose idea was that
It was Aryehs camera anddd
Whose idea was eh to walk down not on the trail on the bed
I dont know not mine
Totally mine
Oh wait
No you werent even there
You werent even a concept yet
But it was very unpleasant
Supposedly I was a concept from day one
It was very very unpleasant to tell Aryeh that his camera his beloved camera got wet was traumatic
yes so obviously the big thing to talk about is
release
release
because apparently no one knows what were doing
I mean we do but no one else does
so
so were recording them using your iPad and then making transcripts
no I might bring an interface and an actual microphone probably
I wasnt sure if we were gong for like the subtle like people arent aware that theyre being recorded
the idea is that they should know but we shouldnt make it blatantly obvious
we should know but we shouldnt like put a cam
we shouldnt like stand in front of them like shoving a mic in their face and be like
that would just make them nervous
exactly thats
thata what we wanted to avoid
a big giant microphone is staring at them
well usually in Japanese class they record all of the presentations and stuff
what they do is just take a regular old tape recorder and put it on the table
okay
Im just not sure if
I feel like I can type fast enough
Youre sayig that its not necessar
I mean were bound to miss something
okay I mean as long as
as long as we are fine with taking the time afterwards to go through all of them and that we know that we can tell people that in a way that
because the whole point is that we just need to make sure that people actually talk about something and then we can get a written version of it
yes
part of the thing is that nobody ever took notes before and didnt even try
I think as long as theyre okay with being recorded I think thats the better solution because its more thorough and thats more correct
if you think taking notes is a viable alternative
it could also be very distracting
someones like typing away and its like
and like and at thi at this hour they said something so insightful and now theyve said something really dumb
dont put that on the record
whipe that from the record
um
but yes um food
are we going to have food for releas
I think I think before we talk about food we should talk about how we want to
yes this is true
so weve got uh how many groups do we have twelve thirtee
thirteen
thirteen
um
well okay Space Game was the fourteenth one
no the fourteenth one was Not Asteroids
oh right that was the one that died
yeah
uh Space Game I think should still present
they went long enough that they
yeah
I think I I think their postmortem could actually be useful
if he sticks at all to the postmortem thing it will be useful and if he completely doesnt do anything relevant to what a postmortem is
then
its not a very good postmortem
well if he uses this to start another politics debate
maybe have him do some
right
cause you can say what about GCSs policies didnt allow the project to do whatever but
well if it gets
instead of starting like a flame war
yeah if it gets into an off topic flame war
was he saying that befor
yeah
last meeting
not not last meeting
it was the last meeting of Space Game where he said he was cancelling the project and we asked him what the problem was and he basically went on this flame war rant about why GCS sucks
yeah that was fun um
but if it gets to that well just tell him to stop and move on
I think were gonna have to time limit them anyway
yeah were definitely gonna have to time limit them
were gonna have to cut it off at five minute
we we wanna have room for Q and A
thats cause thats what happened the last Spring was a bunch of people left as soon as they could
but a lot of peole stayed
but not nearly as many people as you would who were there
so do you wanna try four minutes and just no Q and
I would just say keep it at five minute cause some groups might have less to say and we might have more time for questions
well we could mention that you should try to be concise and not take up time if you dont need to in the email
yeah but also like when we play the games a lot of the times its the creator thats standing right next to the game and thats another time you can ask questions
thats true and then and then they dont feel like theyre being grilled by the whole club if theyre the one up there whereas like you can like as an alternative we can go up to Chris afterwards and then say all right why dont you think like the club is condu conducive to your games
well but the real reason we like Q and A during postmortems is because there are interesting questions that can benefit the rest of the club
yes
yeah
and they would also be good to have on record
would an hour and a half be too long to do all of the
I dont think so
okay cause if we gave everybody seven minutes and said
just like five minutes for
well well we could say five minute cutoff for speaking two minute cutoff for Q and A
an hour would be fine which is about five minutes
well how about four minutes for speaking and a minut for Q and
well I dont wanna like restrict anybody to anything but I would just cut it off see how it goes and cut it off
I dont think that everyone will be seven minutes
um
youd be surprised
five minutes and then at the end of five minutes whatever just cut them off have the next person go and that should be a little over an hour
yeah
okay
and then we can have food and games
I still think five minutes is I dunno i its a problem because we have so many groups and
but its but thats still only thats like an hour and ten minutes cause if you if you give every group like thirty seconds between
we could try to do food during the Q and A so people would
Im not sure if that would be distracting and that if that would also like encourage people to stay by saying that theres pizza
all right I have an idea why dont we try something differen
why dont have them speak with a five minute cutoff and then have all of them stand in front as as a panel and then have people ask whoever they want questions or just the
theres thirteen groups people will forget what the people at the very beginning said
cause its like what happened at Pitch Fair when everybody did their thing and at the end nobody could remember
who said what
yeah
yeah
that was actually the biggest problem with Pitch Fair
its a little bit different but I feel like its easier to ask questions like right when everybodys thinking about whatever youre asking about
I I think thats the case
I guess it depends on what kind of questions we want them to ask
if theyre questions specifically about the things that were just said then sure but if theyre more general things like
I remember asking Chris like really general general questions last time just cause I knew that hed have interesting things to say um and that would be the kind of thing for like a panel but my the problem is that its a lot of people and I think that would work better for like five people or something but for thirteen I think thats probably too many
cause when you add with Lisa and Sanchez and and uh Paul and Audra
this is why we seriously need to start limiting the number of projects that get made
well
ho
thats I mean the whole
well discuss that later
the whole point of the having smaller projects is that there are going to be significantly more of them
yeah there would actually be more projects if we had shorter projects
there wouldnt necessarily be more semester projects there would just be more projects
we probably handle those a bit differently
thered be less at a given time
right if we had smaller projects you wouldnt have one day when there are like seventyx that youd need to present
so yeah the food
um are we gonna have food during the uh you know during the postmortems or afte
wait what did we do last
well last Spring it showed up when we were sitting there and it was just sitting there
yeah yeah and it was really awkward cause everyone kept looking at the pizza
so why dont we let people ea
yeah
we could just order it so it comes an hour into the meeting
see I could the only problem that I have is that when you server greesy pizza while people are playing games
the thing is though its fine as long as there are napkins
yeah
I think eating pizza while the postmortems are going on is kind of distracting and rude because people would be constantly getting up and getting pizza and not really paying attention and its the most important part I dunno
if its the most important part why are we compressing it so much for the other thin
because playing the games and talking to people individually is also really important and its kind of we cant have everyone play their game while giving a postmortem but if nobody gets a chance to play everyone elses game because everyones a lazyass and doesnt give their builds I think theyre both just as important
right
Id say we dont wanna sacrifice one for the other because they are equally important
postmortems are a thing that happens only once a semester but those games will be played again when theyre more polished in the future
yeah
for example the arcade uh late night there would be plenty of chances
and Release in the Spring
to be actually getting to get
it is in the Spring but
seeing your hard work from this semester pay off in the form of someone playing and enjoying your game I think is a big part of feeling like youre done like that the semester is actually over
why dont we do the gameplaying thing first and then postmortems out of curiosit
because people would leave well that was I thought the initial problem
yeah I think postmortems are a tougher sell to keep an audience than games
like lets play games and then everybody gets really into it and theyre like guys stop having fun lets talk about this
theres really no easy solution
well no if you want the pizza to come an hour in I can do that too
what do you guys thin
its fine
I think that would be good
having having postmortems then pizza come right as theyre ending
well it is gonna take time for everybody to set their laptops up then get the games ready to play anyway so we might as well be able to eat
and Im thinking the pizza could bribe them into staying
well thats yeah thats when were eating
like theyd have the pizza to look forward to after the postmortems are done
Im trying to imagine what an exodus would look like if we said like all right were gonna stop playing games now and then you know postmortems and everybody sit down in a chair
everybody but the project leaders would leave
Im trying to yeah
I dont think it would be that bad
well okay two thirds of everybody but the project leaders would leave
assuming they came in the first place
lets see what else is there
is there anything els
um we need to send out an email we should do that as soon as possible like today
about Releas
about about just telling telling project leaders well about Release to the whole club but also to the project leaders specifically
I can do that today
we also um need to ask for builds of the games from last semesters right now only Moonwalk is up cause I put it up there um
can somebody who has the list of the projects from the last this semester and last semester I guess send that to me so I can check off what I have and
bother peopl
okay
I mean I was going to at the end of this semester just bug everyone
okay then you can do that too
make sure when you ask them about builds you ask them about like the people who were on their team and and uh like a description or something like that too
right
what do we do about the people who graduate
oh
like Sarah
well I was on that project
that was fun
I think I can find a way to contact Sarah in any case
yeah we dont have much of an alumni program
well we have more uh yeah youre right
they can stay on the mailing list they just need to either change their email themselves or ask us to change it for them
but I have all the project members for Panda Cook and that was that would be easy enough to write a description for it so just a build for that
all right so anything else in regards to postmortem
right basically brief summary
um were limiting postmortems to high hard cap of uh five minutes for each postmortem cause uh if it they drag on too long everyone will leave before they can play the games
um
and were gonna be recording them and then transcribe them later
so what should we talk about no
I mean that was
and then and then after postmortems we play games
yes
how much food do you think we should ge
uh I usually go by uh dollar amount so between like one twenty and one fifty however much pizza I can get for that much money is usually
thats cool
I think that should cover it
Im not sure how many people are gonna show up
so I think by comparison I think the last uh the last two Collab Sessions were like seventy dollars
yeah they should be about equal
so yes weve got the uh then weve got also got Paolos event do we want to talk about that briefl
lets talk about that
okay so Paolo has an event on the eleventh which is essencially um its its essencially like GCS arcade where it would be we all show our games at to the public
what date is this agai
you said the sevent
the eleventh
oh got it
its a Saturay isnt i
yeah so did he did he change the time so that its not at the same time as BV
I dont think so
okay
its at its at the same time as the inviteonly BVW its not the same time as the first show which is open to the public
so its the VIP show
yeah
um
but its the VIP show and its cooler
yeah and you have to be invited
which we were but I dont think we need apparently we need paper invitations and theres no way theyre gonna print out paper invitations for the entire club
he he said like in the email he could possibly be possibly like print out actual invitations for us but yeah its it was mainly like an
just that the VIPs later so they have more time to practice their acting cause its like theres also a performance aspect so its the same thing
yeah
okay
yeah if people arent as cool or yeah so it doesnt overlap with the public one so it would be okay
when is the public on
one I think
oh so its the same day
one until I I think the next one is at like five or seven or later in the evening
cause the problem is if theyre right one after the other wed need time to s get out of there and set up
yeah
the thing for Paolo
or we could always leave early
wha what kind of setup would we have to d
Im not sure
were probably just gonna have to plug in our laptops because
how big is the space gonna b
we assumed Paolo is doing most of the setup since its his event
yeah we were told that he has like tables and power cords for us
so it sounds like that
how many tables does he wan
wha
oh so basically we still dont know whats going on
well we know its at
the how what space is it in and how many people is he expecting like is he does h
how many games does he want from u
oh a lot of project people
as many people who can do it in essencially
people wont be here because its just like Saturday of finals week
okay
thankyou ladies for doing my experiment
whats gonna happen now is my experiment is how people make concept maps as they are learning things
and so the name of the game is Mao
and Mao is a game where you learn the rules by playing it in a trial and error sort of way
usually the game is played with a full deck
and there are alot more rules
I gave you a paired down version so we could go for a paired down version so we could go for the same rules and not have much variability
the rules were
partners in crime is when two of the same card are put down
thats
continuity is when a card increment of values is put down like a four and a five or a six and a seven
law of fours you say
law of fours
and it then gives the person whose turn it is after you four cards
law of fives is
actually wait
can I hear what you think law of fives is
you haveto put down another card after you put down the five
and what do you think law of fives is
what did you think
the same thing
mkay yes ‡ law of fives is where you put down the five you haveto put down another card after it
Firstname can I hear what you thought have a nice day was
so sometimes when they said
to the best of your ability
put down the sevens
you would say
have a nice day
and so I started doing that too
but I didnt really know if that was correct
and I have literally no idea when else I should do it
okay ‡ and what do you think have a nice day is
whenever you put down a seven you say
have a nice day
and if the person before you put down a seven you say
thankyou very much
yes
so ‡ seven is like seven days in a week
so to have a nice day
and then if you receive a seven like if its your turn you say
thankyou very much
what did you think crazy eights was Firstname
I thought it was reverse the way we go
but now I think its like just the person before you goes
and then it goes back to where you were
and what did you think it was Firstname
I thought it was always reversed in order
its you skip the next person
oh
so ‡ in the game with like five or six youd see that because only one person was skipped
because theres
yeah ‡ it was confusing when it was only three
only a game of three
yeah ‡ so the order was never reversed
okay
what did you think bowling was
Firstname
when the two cards
so ‡ theres the card thats already there
and if the card youre putting down makes those two cards add up to ten you call spire
yeah mkay
so thats the game
what rule did you get really fast Firstname
what was the first rule you got
continuity
and why do you think that was
because thats pretty similar to games like EgyptianRatScrew
where you like try and like match cards that are like in a row
like one in numerical value
and what rule was the hardest for you to get
have a nice day
and why do you think that was
because it seemed completely arbitrary
it wasnt tied to any pattern that I could see in the cards
okay
because I just think I wasnt looking at like singular card values
I was looking for patterns
okay
and what was the easiest rule for you to get
Iguess either continuity or partners in crime
and why would you say so for you
because the names made sense
okay ‡ and what was the hardest
because like they defined it
spare because you introduced it in the last game
mkay
and why do you think
again because I introduced in the last game you didnt have time to learn it
yeah
okay ‡ what did you
why do you think law of fives was like kindof hard to get „ Firstname
because you hadto be watching
like I dont know
hm
I dont know
Iguess with that rule you just had to pay alot more attention
about the other rules
and why was the law of fives hard for you
I kept forgetting you need to also put down a card
so I understood that it was similar to law of fours
but it was like Id forget to put down a card
okay
so yeah ‡ thankyou so much for doing this for me
can we play again
no
okay
so ‡ like I said well be playing a card game
after each move just write a quick justification of why you made that move
I wont be able to give you any instructions
were not doing this for gesture or anything
so dont be worried about that
were not really doing it for speech either
so just feel free to speak
as youre playing a card please write like call out the card that youre laying down
thatd be helpful to me
because I cant see the video of them
mkay
so ‡ lets begin
dont pick them up until I say
alright
okay
so ‡ this is a card game called Mao
before you pick up your cards there are rules
and the rules are are partners in crime continuity law of fours law of fives have a nice day and crazy eight
mkay
pick up your cards
well start with me and go clockwise
and begin
continuity
seven of diamonds
failure to say have a nice day
failure to say continuity
and then remember just to write down why you put that down
if its just a guess just put guess until you can formulate something
law of fours
failure to say thankyou very much
okay ‡ so the last recording was interrupted
we havent moved forward on the game
I just laid down a four and called law of fours and partners in crime
the rules again just to refresh are partners in crime continuity law of fours law of fives have a nice day and crazy eights
these are yours
alright
can we
ugh we cant ask for rules „ okay
law of fours
failure to say partners in crime
remember to write down your justification
okay
okay ‡ keep going
law of fours
law of fours thankyou very much have a nice day partners in crime
unnecessary saying have a nice day
unnecessary saying thankyou very much
continuity
three of hearts
Im sorry I havent been calling out
okay
continuity two of hearts
law of fives five of clubs
unnecessary speaking and failure to play another card
what
but failure to play another card
continuity
continuity seven of spades
failure to say have a nice day
what is this
partners in crime
failure to say have a nice day
failure to say thankyou very much
thankyou very much
what
have a nice day
did you write down
have a nice day seven diamonds
failure to say thankyou very much
once again if you could write down the justification
law of continuity
thankyou very much
you dont haveto say
law of
okay
partners in crime
this is so stressful
continuity
failure to place another card
I dont understand this game at all
failure to place another card
so when youre done describe done
oh ‡ okay
continuity
failure to say law of fours
this is so frustrating
my turn
law of fours thankyou very much
unnecessary speaking
failure to say partners in crime
I think the only rule I understand is continuity
continuity
so scared
partners in crime
partners in crime
crazy eights
okay
partners in crime
not your turn
failure to go
continuity
failure to say have a nice day
shit
thankyou very much
the name of the game is Mao
so ‡ thats the end of the first game
if you could put your cards down
actually lets talk about it for a second
so ‡ what rules did you understand
continuity partners in crime
law of fours
law of fours and law of fives „ I think
mkay
crazy eights I think also reversed our order
yeah
so yeah so it
that took not as long as I thought
so what were gonna do
okay
so ‡ were starting game two
if you wanna like label the first one as game one
and then separate it somehow
and go to game two
you dont haveto say what card youre placing
just kindof as Firstnames doing is a good one just to write down like the card
okay
yeah ‡ either ways fine
the cards not that important
its just kindof how were dealing with the rules
okay
once again the name of the game is Mao
the rules are law of fours law of fives continuity partners in crime have a nice day and crazy eights
well start with Firstname and go counterclockwise
continuity
or please write down
partners in crime
okay
partners in crime
is that clover spades
thats spades
spades
crazy eights
wait
I need to finish writing down my reason
have a nice day continuity
thankyou very
not your turn
ah
failure to go
so now its my turn
okay
continuity
have a nice day
failure to say thankyou very much
not your turn
damnit this is
is it my turn now
what did you say when you put that down
the six
yeah
nothing
not your turn
continuity
thankyou very much
unnecessary speaking
failure to place another card
law of fours
hm failure to say continuity
continuity
crazy eights
you dont haveto play another card
okay
law of fours
continuity
not your turn
damnit
continuity
partners in crime
continuity
failure to say card
and failure to say law of fours
oh
and once again just keep writing as you
crazy eights
so ‡ Firstname just called crazy eights
continuity have a nice day
thankyou very much partners in crime
failure to say have a nice day
what
thankyou very much continuity
did you say have a nice day
I said
okay
thankyou very much
continuity
failure to place another card
continuity
for my turn I drew
I just dont know if you missed it
you can do that
I dont have anything
oh
partners in crime
and also because if I played Id end the game
and I want to keep it going
thats why I drew
once again if you could write down
crazy eights
so ‡ Firstname called crazy eights
continuity
unnecessary placing of an extra card
failure to say have a nice day
if you could write down
wait what did she say when she put that down
Firstname what did you say
I said
continuity
and then I put down another card
but it wasnt necessary
okay okay okay
okay ‡ partners in crime have a nice day and the name of the game is Mao
failure to say thankyou very much
fuck
damnit
youre close
continuity crazy eights
not your turn
law of fives
thankyou very much
failure to place another card
remember to write down
I dont understand
this is so stressful
okay
partners in crime law of fives law of fours
the name of the game is Mao
failure to say continuity
no
but atleast youre almost winning
I suck at this game
continuity
continuity law of fours the name of the game is Mao
damnit
oh ‡ lets see
okay
oh ‡ shit
I think I figured out most of the rules
mkay
I just keep forgetting about things
okay ‡ so if you could just respond when I say a rule
tell me definitely I have an idea or not at all
mkay
okay
law of fours
I have an idea
definitely
law of fives
I have an idea
definitely
have a nice day
not at all
definitely
crazy eights
definitely
definitely
continuity
definitely
definitely
partners in crime
definitely
I have an idea
that was everything „ right
okay ‡ law of fours is a maybe for me
have a nice day
thats
mhm
thats when
probably shouldnt say
hmhm
okay so ‡ now
so ‡ this is the third game
and were all
oh ‡ Im not
but the two participants are going to speak out loud justification aswellas write it down
actually instead of writing it down
but if you could write down the cards you put down if that makes sense
but I dont haveto write the reason anymore
hmhm because were just stating it out loud
mkay
and then were gonna play this game until we all think were pretty okay with some of the rules
all of them dont haveto be definitely
but this is just kindof to get us on the same plane
mkay
once again the name of the game is Mao
Im calling the rules
law of fours law of fives have a nice day crazy eights partners in crime continuity and a final rule bowling
you added a rule
fuck
well start with Firstname and go clockwise
partners in crime
and why
because every time someone has called partners in crime its because theyre like two of the same value card
crazy eights
and why
because when you put down an eight its like a wild card that changes the rotation of play
and then because its a diamond card I assume I need to put down another card on top of it
unnecessary playing of another card
okay
thats totally not true
okay ‡
law of five
because its kindof like a wild card
but like it doesnt matter what was below it
and that means I haveto put down another card
so Ill put down crazy eights
because it doesnt matter whats beneath it
and that changes the direction
okay ‡ Ill start talking
spare
one two
whats the
because I think they make a spare
okay ‡ continuity
not your turn
okay
partners in crime
because
because a two was put down
continuity
because a three is higher than a two by one
oh ‡ I havent been
I havent been writing down what
oh ‡ thats okay
dont worry
okay
continuity
because a two is one less than a three
continuity because a three is one more than a two
and the name of the game is Mao
and why did you say that
because whenever youre done you say that
mkay ‡ Im gonna give you more cards just so we can keep playing
okay
but I win
yes
yes
okay so ‡ its my turn „ right
I put down a four continuity
because its one more than three
okay
and law of fours also applies
because
because its a four
then you get four cards
because I said law of fours correctly
otherwise I would get four cards
because I would fail
okay ‡ continuity
and because its a five
partners in crime
spare
and because its a five continuity
Im putting down a seven and calling continuity
because its one more than six
and have a nice day because its a seven
oh
I cant play anything
I mean Ill put down a three
I dont think I can play the
thats just all that I have
thats just all that I have
failure to say thankyou very much
failure to call spare
okay
oh ‡ maybe threes you say thankyou very much
continuity law of fours
okay
partners in crime law of fours
and why did you say those things
because there was already a four down
and law of fours because I put down a four
and these are yours Firstname
oh ‡ okay
continuity
because five is more than four by one
also its a diamond
so I feel like I haveto put down another card
so Im gonna play a two
I dont know why its in my head that you haveto put down cards after
but it is
crazy eights spare
okay
crazy eights continuity
and
failure to say partners in crime
that too
and why did you say crazy eights and well continuity
crazy eights because its an eight
and continuity because I had thought
and I guess I still have this wrong
that Firstname put down a card of the same value as the continuity
so I wasnt sure if continuity would also be the same value
but maybe it cant be
so ‡ were going clockwise
and it was Firstnames turn
and then she said
crazy eights
for putting out an eight
no ‡ at first it was going this way
and then she called
crazy eights
so its your turn now
really
okay
partners in crime crazy eights
so
spare
not your turn
partners in crime crazy
Imean just crazy eights
failure to say spare
oops I said the rule wrong
I should have had law of fours
not your turn
I think I can put an eight down
I
what
have a nice day
partners in crime have a nice day
failure to say
thankyou very much
why did you say partners in crime and have a nice day
partners in crime because its the same value
and have a nice day because I thought sevens were have a nice days
right yes
but apparently sometimes theyre also thankyou very much
thankyou very much
spare
continuity
spare
incorrect
why did you say spare
so I was thinking that a spare is something thats in the same suit
and its more than like two numbers away from the card
so something was just like a random card that is in the same suit
continuity because its one less
and because its a five
continuity law of fours
because its one less
and because its a four
continuity law of fives
and why did you say that first one
because five is one more than four
and law of fives because I put down a five
and I put down another card because I put down a five
and I put down law of fours and call spare
unnecessary calling of spare
why did you say spare
because
also you forgot to say continuity
oh yeah
I thought because it was like a sandwich like four or five or
mkay
I dont understand spare
yeah
continuity
and then we
okay
unnecessary placing of a card
no
really
okay
continuity law of fours
and why
because four is one more than three
mhm
law of fours because its a four
okay
continuity
law of fives
thankyou very much
why did you say thankyou very much
its like a shot in the dark when youre looking at me
I either say have a nice day or thankyou very much
but Im not sure so I alternate randomly
failure to place another card
okay
yes ‡ I see you looking at me
and I can tell you expect something further
and youre about to penalize me
so I pick one of the two and just say it randomly
can you place another card
failure to say continuity
theres no penalty for failing to say continuity
there is
but I wanna keep the stack
oh ‡ lame
I have so many cards
okay
continuity because three is one more than two
I just realized theres no aces or faces in here
mhm I paired down the deck
continuity because two is less than three
and just FYI I know
thats not a mechanism of the game
Im just drawing to keep playing
okay
so ‡ that was my turn
oh ‡ okay
continuity
because
because three is one more than two
mkay
partners in crime
because its the same as three
continuity because two is one less than three
have a nice day
crazy eights continuity
failure to say thankyou very much
law of fours
continuity law of fives
and why do you say that
because five is more than four so continuity
and then whenever I put a five down I saw law of fives
okay
thats it
thats all I do
failure to place another card
okay
okay
okay ‡
partners in crime because theyre the same suit
and law of fives because I put a five down
put down another card
have a nice day
whyd you say that
because its a seven
okay
partners in crime have a nice day
failure to say thankyou very much
spare
because seven plus three is ten
AKA a spare in bowling
oh
thankyou very much because Firstname put down a seven and told me to have a nice day
and the name of the game is Mao
but thats what you say when you win
mkay so ‡ now
I think spare is the only thing I didnt figure out
Im gonna call out the rules
and then tell me once again definitely I have an idea or not at all
partners in crime
definitely
definitely
continuity
definitely
definitely
law of fours
definitely
definitely
definitely
law of fives
definitely
definitely
have a nice day
definitely
no idea
crazy eights
maybe
sorta
and bowling
now definitely
sorta
okay ‡ Ill get the camera
mkay so once again thankyou guys very much for taking part in this experiment
once again Im doing concept maps of how people learn
and it was kindof hard to do because I can confound by you guys saying out like you did in the last game
thats why I had you write it down
Ill be going through those later
so each rule was
partners in crime is when the same value is placed
continuity is when a value one less or one greater is placed
the eight to two in normal Mao the ace to two you do say continuity
but in this one I took it out
okay
thats probably an oversight
law of fours is when you play it the person whose turn it is after you gets four cards
law of fives is when place a six correct you place another card
the one time I didnt give Firstname a card because
oh ‡ I gave him a card
but then he didnt place another one so we just moved on with our lives
sorry if that confused you
okay
have a nice day was when we placed a seven because theres seven days in a week
and then when youre receiving a seven you say thankyou very much
crazy eights skips the next person
and thats it
what was the Firstname easiest rule for you to learn
partners in crime
and why do you think that is
it was the very first one that happened
mkay
was it like
like you put one down
Firstname put one down
you told him he was wrong
and then it was a pretty standard rule from there
yeah
okay ‡ what was the hardest for you to learn
which ones you could put down without having to have some connection to the other one
so the lack of rules
yeah ‡ the lack of rules hard
okay ‡
okay ‡ Firstname what was the easiest for you to learn
I think partners in crime and continuity were
I think partners in crime came first and then continuity soon after
but the reasons were similar in that they could happen at any card
mhm
so ‡ they happened the most frequently
so ‡ you had the most like data points to interpret
mkay ‡ and what was the hardest for you to learn
law of fives apparently
because it seemed very often people would put fives and fours together
and it was hard to like separate those and experiment while playing
mhm
also sixes I had one six the whole game
I just didnt pay attention when anyone else put one down
and yeah and then at the very end you put one down
and it was like nothing
I think that was the first time I realized
the first time I put a six down and apparently it was partners in crime
oh ‡ okay
yeah ‡ theres no rules for sixes
is it like you can say partners in crime for sixes
oh ‡ no ‡ not the not like a full
okay ‡ just that theres not additional rules
yeah ‡ exactly
in regular Mao there is a rule there
but I took it out
there was supposed to be a rule called bowling which is kindof my fault
Im sorry
and bowling is when two values add to ten you say spare
but we didnt get there
so yeah so thankyou guys for playing
also I was trying to figure out what suits were important for it when I stopped because it didnt seem like they were
doing anything
yeah ‡ once again in normal Mao you haveto match the suit
this one I took it out because itd be alittle harder
final thoughts from Firstname about generally how you think your learning process went and what helped you learn better
where did things click for you
sometimes I try to do just random stuff
and I think that was helpful because alotof the errors were very clear
mhm
I started writing down the areas like halfway here
and I started to pay alot more attention to that because I think that was like alotof learning
like and saying unnecessary speaking was like
I couldnt figure that one out
but have a nice day after a five was
okay
could you repeat the question
I dont remember where I was going with that
oh ‡ it is final thoughts like what helped you learn more what clicked
when were things like
oh ‡ I know this now
I like the pace of our game being slow
I feel like if you play this in a group of people its much faster
and I think write this down
lets see
laws of fours was pretty easy because there was like a distinct action following that
so ‡ that was like easy to pair those two together
looking back law of fives place its the to place another card
okay
I didnt put that together
okay ‡ so ‡ you had alotof errors with that which is what you said helped you learn
yep
but its an interesting
but yeah
Iguess I didnt see the common thread
mkay
and Firstname same question what helped you learn the most and when did things seem to click
I tried to repeat everything that was correct and not repeat something else until Firstname made a mistake
and so it clicked when there was one where he made three mistakes at once
then I got most of the clues
okay ‡ and that was the three fives in a row „ I think
and
he forgot to say thankyou very much and didnt haveto put another card down and didnt say continuity
okay
and yeah I think that was after a five
that seems like it
and then yeah I couldnt learn the cards with the rules because theres no mistakes with the rules
mhm
I had „ yeah
that was interesting
so ‡ yeah ‡ so ‡ how this worked is in my concept maps there are rules that are
so theres oned twod and threed as in dimensional
so ‡ partners in crime and continuity are just one
you play it
boom thats the rule
the hardest then are law of fives and just law of fives because not only do you haveto recognize it but you haveto play something else after
thats like a two step
the middle tier of difficulty is the sevens for thankyou very much because it is a reaction for it
but its just based on that card
so ‡ I think actually it goes with what you guys were saying where continuity and were easiest law of fives is hardest and in the middle somewhere you got the sevens and the eights which is kindof what I was hoping for
cool
so ‡ thankyou so much for playing again
okay ‡ so this is play through number one
this is using cards two through eight
yeah ‡ because its usually using the entire deck with alotof rules
Im pairing it down just so we get alotof intermissions going
are we allowed to ask any questions
Im not going to answer any of them unless like
you just did
oh ‡ shit
I shouldnt have said shit
aw I said it again
said it again
okay
okay ‡ Ill pick this up
the name of the game is Mao
Im calling rules
law of threes law of fours
no ‡ Im sorry
Im gonna scoot back
the name of the game is Mao
Im calling rules
law of fours law of fives continuity partners in crime have a nice day and crazy eights
okay
you may pick up your cards
well start with me going clockwise
once again each time you make a move please write down a card and just add justification of why
mkay
and we keep our cards private
hm
keep our cards private
yes
so ‡ here we go
failure to say partners in crime
partners in crime
okay
do you need like the suit also or just the number
yeah ‡ the suit would be great
partners in crime
partners in crime
crazy eights
not your turn
failure to go
do I keep this
partners in crime again
failure to say crazy eights
and then once again write down your justification
should I write down the consequences of whether it was valid or not
whatever your thought process is
failure to go
god youre slow
its not your turn
he hasnt gone yet
so ‡ do you still go when you fail to go
okay
continuity
unnecessary speaking
failure to say law of fours
phew
partners in crime law of fours
crazy eights
as a side note Im gonna be drawing cards
thats only to prolong the game
thats not the mechanic of the game
okay
not your turn
you called crazy eights
so on my turn I drew a card
oh ‡ okay
law of fives partners in crime
failure to place another card
law of fives partners in crime
failure to place another card
law of fives partners in crime
the name of the game is Mao

partners in crime
I have an idea
I have an idea

crazy eights
law of fours the name of the game is Mao

okay
here we go
okay
well start assessing this time
partners in crime
definitely

so ‡ this is game three speaking out loud
final game
what time is it
game time
two zero zero tenish
oh okay okay
I thought it was
okay ‡ here we go
yes ‡ were playing cards
in a group study room
okay ‡ can you put the cards down please
the name of the game is Mao
Ill call the rules
law of fours law of fives partners in crime continuity have a nice day crazy eights and bowling
were starting with Firstname and going clockwise
and remember well be speaking out loud our justification for each card placed
and the rules still must be said
partners in crime because the previous card is the same value
continuity law of fours because the previous card is a three
and because its a four
I dont know if I should speak or not
okay ‡ I will speak
because
partners in crime because the previous card had the same value
continuity because the previous card was a two
partners in crime because the previous card has the same value
continuity because
wait „ no
just law of fours
failure to say continuity
okay
my justification for just law of fours is that you could do law of fours any time
partners in crime law of fours
and whyd you say those
oh ‡ because theres two of the same card
and its a four
okay
continuity law of fives because its one less than four
and its a five
partners in crime law of fives because theyre the same value
you didnt say why you did law of fives
what
you didnt
because its five
partners in crime and law of fives because its yeah another five
have a nice day because its a seven
thankyou very much because you said
have a nice day
have a nice day because its a seven
and partners in crime because its the same value
continuity thankyou very much because Firstname said
have a nice day
and because six is one less than seven
have a nice day continuity because seven is one more than six
and because its a seven
thankyou very much and crazy eights
thankyou very much because the previous person said
have a nice day
and crazy eights because you can do it any time
continuity also because one above seven
boom
partners in crime crazy eights because theyre the same value
and because its an eight
partners in crime crazy eights and that phrase you say when youre out of cards thats something about Mao
because the name of the game is Mao
Im gonna give you credit because Firstname helped you with that
but yes
oh ‡ oh ‡ my apologies „ camera
you placed an eight „ correct
yes
you placed an eight „ right Firstname
yeah
okay
oh ‡ do I go again
I pick up for my turn
its not your turn
failure to go
partner in crime crazy eights because its the same value
and its an eight
and because I deduced it was my turn
continuity have a nice day
thankyou very much law of fives
law of fives partner in crime
thankyou very much because it was after seven
law of fives on each card because it was a five
and partners in crime on the second five because the previous value was also a five
failure to place another card
Im gonna pick up for my turn
continuity because six is more than five by one
law of fours because you can place it any time
Ive been forgetting the rule bowling so well play without it
yes
okay
continuity because three is less than four
is there no justification for that one
because I dont have to say anything
okay
oh
crazy eights because you can place it any time
theres no rule
I will draw a card
continuity have a nice day
because its one greater than six
and its a seven
thankyou very much the name of the game is Mao
when I said six
what
okay ‡
I guess I didnt have any sixes this whole game
I had one six
so ‡ were gonna go through the rules again
if you guys could tell me with what certainty once again definitely I have an idea and no for each rule
start with Firstname this time
partners in crime
definitely
definitely
continuity
almost definitely
oh ‡ definitely
law of fours
definitely
definitely
law of fives
definitely
almost definitely
Firstname can I hear what you think law of fives is
sure ‡ I think you can place a five any time
that seems to be the only thing Ive noted
and what do you think law of fives is
hm placing timed and if you place it you get another turn
except there is one time when Firstname didnt take another turn after he put it down which is why its almost definitely
okay
have a nice day
definitely
definitely
crazy eights
definitely
definitely
okay ‡ good so ‡ now were gonna stop here
which
so my continuity Im just not sure how the eight to two works
did I say continuity for that
no ‡ Im curious
oh ‡ okay
thats like rule whether there is a rule there or not
oh ‡ okay
also Im not sure how like triples or anything like that works
and what are gaps for you
there is the one with the five so Firstname didnt put another one down and the lack of rule for a six and putting it down any time
mkay
