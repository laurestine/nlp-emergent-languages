Right
and I
I already got another apartment
for when I move out
oh you did
yeah
Wher
it's on the corner of Columbia and Cole
uhhuh
and it's a one bedroom and
so I had to put down like a deposit and
you know and pay the rent for it so I could hold it
mhm
but that's okay
oh good
Then I won't have to , you know how
all the people are looking for houses now
yeah
yeah , I'm sure they are
well that's good
well , so what have you been doing other than wor
um
Not really much of anything
um
I usually I just come home from work and like stay home
and
e- I don't know
I haven't done much
uhhuh
We went to Santa_Fe yesterday
oh yeah
you know me and Henry
Well that's cool
yeah but otherwise
it's been a kind of boring summer
mhm
Like nobody's here
Just like Henry and Leroy
yeah
yeah it's been boring for me too
but
at least I'm saving money I guess
yeah when are you coming bac
The nineteenth
oh
When does school star
The twenty second
oh okay
I don't even know
I just knew it was around the twentieth
yeah
I think it's the twenty second
mhm
but
yeah
Have you talked to Le
um yes
I haven't talked to him since I think like Tuesday
mm
but he's coming back to Albequerque tomorrow
oh he is
yeah
I thought he was going to Philadelphia
No
No h-
he doesn't have the money
oh okay
and then I couldn't get off work
oh
so if he came then
like I would still have to go to work
oh okay
so we decided that that was a waste
Because when you went
to Oregon he told me that he was
he wasn't going to be back until like August because he was going to like visit you
yeah
yeah that was originally the plan but
then like apparently my mom agreed /
oh
that I would work for this place for exactly three months
Like and I didn't know that
mm
so I'm required to work until the sixteenth
oh
so
it's kind_of a bummer
Well that suc-
Are you
you guys are staying in the house righ
ca-
yeah
yeah
That's what Lee said
I forgot
yeah
but who's going to live with yo
I don't know
I was hoping it was going to be you
oh
but
oh well
Lee said that that you guys wanted to try to live by yourself
No that's what he wanted
oh okay
because he told me because he told me you know that you guys
that was
because Suzy was moving out and then he said
if I w- if I needed a place to stay I could stay there
but you guys had wanted to like try and live
just you two
oh
Well that wa- that was his plan
and I said to him no , I want to live with Stephanie
oh really
I didn't know that
I wouldn't have gotten like my apartment and
oh really
yeah
oh
I'm sorry
We'll blame him
Maybe you could get your money back now
I don't know
I mean if
it's a month to month lease , so I'm sure
oh really
yeah
How muc
but I d-
It's two ninety five a month
mhm
Which is pretty good
yeah that's good for a one bedroom
yeah
I might
I don't know , I think that I want to live by myself
yeah
Well you've wanted that for a while
yeah
so
Now that I have , but I didn't , I wouldn't have done that
if I would have known it was like definite that you wanted me to live with you
Well th- but I said to him , I don't know if Stephanie could live with me because I'm such a slob
oh
I can't live with with Henry and Leroy because they're slobs and they're
and they don't listen to me
yeah see I thought you w- you might have like gotten used to living with slobs /
oh
since they were
Well no it's just that they like I mean I'm sure you would respect my like cleanliness
but they don't
yeah
No I I try and keep it all in my room
but
mm what is Ann going to d
um
I don't know
but I know that she won't live with me because I hate John
oh , I forgot about him
yeah
That's that was like the last thing she said to me before I left
oh
was that we could never live together because of him
Which is fine by me
yeah
Because you know when he comes he comes for like three weeks
yeah
and I would just go insane
yeah
hm so I I really hate him
I had to- I had totally forgot about him
I guess I k- sort of like blocked him out
I I think most people do
but
yeah
so
That's kind of that
but it's weird
I haven't heard from her all summer
reall
yeah I wrote her
but she didn't write back
mm
but her birthday is Thursday so I should probably call
I think
I don't know
Have you talked to Netti
No
mm
No I haven't
w- we played pool with them like on Saturday night
uhhuh
with her and Anders
and some guy named Mica
oh that's oh I know him
He's my my friend Medea's brother
oh that's Medea's brothe
yeah
oh wow
yeah
They don't look like each other
I've a- I've actu-
h- I don't know if I've ever , I've only seen him from afar
oh
He looks like John Travolta but he has like curly blond hair
oh really
yeah
He's supposed to be pretty cool
yeah he is
He was real nice , yeah
He i
oh that's good
Well that's nice
Anders doesn't live with him , does h
No um , he's like Nick's friend or something
oh
Or
Mick or what's that guy's
May's boyfrien
m-
I don't kno-
Nick
yeah Nick
yeah
and I guess like Nick and May were going to go but they didn't
but they asked this guy
Mica
mhm
to come
I don't know
Now do Nettie and Anders live togethe
No
Anders is living at like on Wesley
I don't know if he lived there before
Still with that guy Mark
Right
yeah
and
and Nettie like started living in this place
on
Girard
uhhuh
You know h- like going to your house
oh okay
and
you know across the street from Jefferson
Jefferson Middle School
yeah
That's going to your house , righ
yeah
She lives right across the street from there
oh well that's nice
and she lives with somebody named
Christine and /
yeah
Lily or something
yeah they were in one of my classes with her
mhm
I remember
Like Christine she's kind of big
yeah
yeah
and then Lily is like has blond hair
I don't know if you know her
I don't think I know her , but I've heard of her
yeah then it's like
hm
When did she move in ther
Like in June I think
uhhuh
Is it nic
It's okay , it's kind of gross
Like
oh
There's like roaches all over the place and stuff
ohgod
Nettie would hate that I think
yeah she was going like
quite crazy
and like I guess the girl who had it before like didn't know how to clean like
period
and it was all gross and stuff
uhhuh
but they
we went
on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so
mhm
I guess it's okay
oh
Well that's good
mm
yeah
The only person I talk to is Mark Diener
Ho- how many times have you talked to hi
He calls every Thursday
Really
yeah
but he's just so cute , I can't say no
He's gotten much better too
oh really
yeah he doesn't get on my nerves
but he gets on my mom's nerves
oh really
Because when she answers the phone he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour
and then she's always like I have to go I have to go
Typical Mark
definitely
so I I told him that my mom's like afraid of the telephone and she doesn't like to talk
but
he's the only one
m-
yeah
hm
I- does anyone hang out with Suz
mm , no
No
That's good
I guess
I guess little Felipe is staying at your house
yeah , I heard that might happen
yeah
and
I bet she loves that
oh yeah And every time I ask , because I see him at Kinko's all the time
uhhuh
and
He's like
she never leaves the house
All she does is bitch
But it's so true
He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then
stays home like the rest of the day
yeah
Why am I not surprise
yeah
so when I was thinking of who I was going to call , because you know this phone call is free
oh it i
yeah and I was
so we can talk as long as we want
and like
Well actually it's supposed to turn off in fifteen minutes
I think the whole thing is screwy
oh
but
you know my dad was like well why don't you call Suzy
and I'm like that is the last person that I want to talk to
For fifteen minutes
I mean I talked to her
like
three weeks ago
and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill
Which I did
and she just forgot
Because she spent the money on something else
and I was just like , whatever
She's totally nutsy
If she like ends up trying to stay I'm going to have a nervous breakdown
Well I think she's already determined to leave , isn't sh
yeah , but see , it's just like her the last minute be too lazy /
Right
to go through with it
yeah , I mean that's just ,
generally speaking , her personality
yeah
Because she was telling us she was going to move out last January
mm
and she was too lazy to do it
so
maybe Felipe will drive her out
ohgod I can't stand her
So , anyway , how are you doing these day
Things are going very well
I think I had mentioned before that , um , that uh , that uh , that there's a company now that I'm working with
um , uh , which is very much just , just myself and Guss
oh
And that
No , you hadn't mentioned that
eh , oh , okay
okay , so
eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at , and you were entertaining offers
And ,
Well i- , well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to , to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts
So
oh
So things are going extremely well
So , I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount
You know , he'd , he , uh , there would be a minimum amount of work , of about uh , a day a week for the next two three years
mhm
Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it would make sense to do this
And ,
and , um , I've been getting substantially more work than then
mm
So I'm quite pleased , quite pleased
Well that's good
So , um , so I have a bunch of work that I need to do on my flat this year
I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time
But , it should , uh , it should come out this year
oh , well that's good
It should be done in a few months
oh , yeah I remember
So
you talking a little bit about it at one point
yeah , yeah
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soo
um
I don't see the finances occurring
uhhuh , right
for a while
um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well
But
ah well
I am working on that one
uh
It's just
But
uh , uh , the the the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up
ah
uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had
oh , harsh
Harsh
yeah
yeah , but , and
Not a whole lot I can do about that now
Indeed
Indeed
have to deal with the situation
And
So that's what I'm doing
Sounds good
But
Anyway ,
One of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic , uh , correspondent has been work
I've actually been doing a_lot_of it
oh wow
And uh , I turned in my Master's thesis back in May , and I'm actually presently working on , um ,
several , uh , articles
oh , okay
Impressive
from it
yeah , actually it turns out that one thing , one little
bit in what I was doing , uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end
And , uh ,
from what I had been reading in the literature
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half
yeah
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there wasn't much discussion
yeah
yup , yup
But ,
Anyway , I had been
kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique
mhm
And it f- , made
w- the one type of solution occur , which
was seen experimentally , but none of the other models had , uh , ha
Yes
They basically , the- , I I'm looking at , um , multi mode lasers
And one of the
things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , uh , states , where
if you look at the total intensity
uhhuh
of the laser , you get
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency
Yes
okay
If you look , i- if you separate out the different modes of the laser
mhm
and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency
okay
So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other's
Exactly
hm
oscillations on these other frequencies
And
uh
you can
With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency
in a transient , but you can't find that frequency in a driven , uh , frequency
You can't find so that it will sustain
okay
Yes
So
yeah , that that particular frequency according to most models
damps out very quickly
And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it
hm
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it
Got it , got it
I see
So , um , I found a
simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty
And in most cases , uh , insoluble
But
yeah
it gives a driving term
oh , okay
So , it actually
creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer ,
you just can't always write it down very easily
Exactly
oh wow
So , so , so you , you- , you're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser
laser , uh , whatever it is science
But which , um , is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing
Indeed
Indeed
Be- being an experimentalist , not a theorist
But
Indeed
oh wow
oh , impressive
But
So , so , so are , so are you going to get an article in Nature or somethin
um , actually ,
I'm not sure if we're shooting for op- , I think
Optics Letters is probably the one that we're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though
I don't think it's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters
hm
But , uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles
yeah
hm
impressive
And
I , I don't know how much you know about scientific literature , but letters are much more prestigious than , articles
oh , okay
oh , w- , I I didn't realize that
okay
yeah , so that that's why it's actually a big deal is
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master's thesis , is ,
not at all unusual in Physics and
yeah
uh , i- it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all
And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that
people have been seeing th-
You know , people see the anti phased motion , and it's true they do in the transients And
I was having a_lot_of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature is in
has this frequency in the transients
Yes
eh and not driven
And , uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis
but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there
this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was ,
that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency , yet their experiments showed it
as a driven frequency
oh cool
And s- and so Neil
then /
Said oh just a second I
like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up
Exactly
And I was like , well I've been telling you that Neil
Indeed
So
Cool
That's
Cool
that's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a_lot_of time on now
um
Well it'll look good on your C V , your resume
So so you might as well spend the time
Yes , well , uh , th- no , it's definitely worth doing
um ,
and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for uh dealing with the burglary issues
oh yeah but
that I've been dealing with
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park
Yes
yeah , okay
yeah
I mean the thing that i- this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to
oh
It's not a question of whether or not ,
you know , that , that was easy , it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into
Exactly
Exactly
yeah
And so the problem is that now they found out that it's worth breaking into
yeah
And unfortunate^ly
Well , i- it's kind of odd
They've stolen very weird things for the most part
hm
A- as far yeah as a
The first time they broke in , they
what they stole was just bizarre , mostly worthless
stuff
And ,
huh
the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the preamplifier of my stereo
Unfortunately , because it's a nice preamplifier , it has an off board power supply which they didn't steal ,
which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless
huh
So
That's bizarre
Bizarre
So , so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh , the off board amplifie
Actually , no , all they stole the second time was my bike
huh
Which was actually where the major problem came
Exactly
Exactly
yeah
Is that I suddenly had no transportation
And so ,
I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike , and
mm
that that cost me a_lot_of time
yeah
Exactly
Because , yes
Spending a_lot_of time hunting for bikes , and
nah well
then getting one purchased , and then having to ,
you know , go get it and things like that
But ,
that's dealt with at least
And so
uh , that's yeah
at least dealt with
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this
But
yeah
yeah
At least
Well that would make sense
during the summer I can actually ,
uh
according to the stipulations of my grant , or my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer
But um , guessed what happened
Wha
um
The
Agai
Let's see , two weeks ago
I know Sue is going to r- Rhode Island
eh Right Right
Did she see her mo
Yes she did
An
Yes she did
An
um , which was um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen
I spoke to her mom on Thursday and
and I asked her I said listen I said please come to Shabbat things have come to a point where I may have to resign relinquish my ,
uh parenting
uh would you mind taking her back and she said no
She said she'd be more than happy to
Reall
This girl is like has everything in her dreams you know
It , it is , it is , it is , it is as my husband says uh ,
uh Al_kadir the destiny Selema I'm telling you , it is like Allah has just painted the road and all I had to do was get on it and follow it
I- , I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me
I told mom I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah ,
only Allah can make the way clear for you
uh
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother
Reall
mhm mhm
And , and , and is she seem like she's together enoug
She's in a , she's in a two year program
She's in the program now
She's doing very well
When I talked to her it's a , I , I'm talking to her like I'm talking to you
I wrote her a letter and told her I said I think I said I I feel like I know you even though I never met you
They seemed surprised that , I mean most women you lose your baby that's it
But almighty God is
You never even get a chance to see them again
That's true
That's true
But that's what she had wrote me
She said , she said , she said it , it is just awesome to her what is , what is happening
yup
mhm
aw I've heard of that
yup
So Francis
Did she say how she felt about what had happene
No
We , we haven't really talked about that but I'm planning on making a trip down to visit her
Well , what how does Akina fee
She , she's , u- , u- , very happy about it
Very ha-
Well did she come home and say I saw her , I look like her or wha
We , we talked on the phone and you know she talked about her sisters and you know and things we've spent the night with her sisters
and things and it's just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , down there and really caused Francis a_lot_of stress
and Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know f- because she just was acting like a total nigger child
uhoh
Hope the research didn't hear that
uhoh
wait wait Alita I'm telling you nobody can handle her but you , okay
And um , but um ,
but she , she was very concerned about me and everything and um because the child had told some , some lies about me and about you
oh
oh
oh no
And about oh yeah mhm
oh goodness
yeah
That we were abusing , that you know , oh yeah she , she did some eh , and it was , it was very , very bad
My daughter inlaw Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday
Told her that she couldn't talk to Jasmine play with Jasmine because she hurt hur- because she said she hurt Jasmine's Jetta
you know and she said that if it wasn't for u- Jas- for Jetta you know Jasmine's daddy wouldn't be oh she'd oh man it was
aw
You know that has always been very scary to me even after
I said to Mark ohmygod What's she going to say because I knew what she would do when if I took her somewhere
you know what she would say and I , you know in these , the climate of today ,
Yes
people saying something like that
That well , you know that's and Francis was very concerned in reference to you know she was in school and things and Francis was , w- , she was very , very concerned
She said Alita she said this little girl has a serious problem
She wrote me a letter
mhm
you know about her needing a_lot_of love , a_lot_of help and different things like this , but you know you've heard the saying I'm sure from your grandmother the fruits of your parents or the sins of your parents will be waged back at you ,
hm
you know , and and I , a- , again my husband said we were going to give it a month , you know and said if he was even going to have to sheik pray over her , you know for the Jen
hm
You know , I mean , we're d- , you know , and I think we're still going to be doing that but I , but I think he's at a point now where he's reserved us
of that um , you know that she may end up going to t-
oh well the thing is your whole life has been around her
mhm
more or less
mhm
mhm
I mean it is you know I mean absorbed
mhm
mhm
where is , you know
mhm mm
And , and , and
you know ,
I mean
This is a lou- , this is a lousy eh I , I , I truly believe that Salem
I don't think , you think she'll be better with her mothe
I , I have no idea
I , I really have no idea
But
And um , but you know the , the , the ,
i- , if this does happen and I do believe it may happen , you know we will have an agreement , she and I , you know , she will become the , the legal guardian and that
uh you know I'm , I just want her to understand everything that has happened in the last several years
yeah
and things like that
She needs to be clear about that because this child won't be like the other two
eh eh
You know ,
Well , she , she said that she was
Andre said that she was
oh yeah
She was like her two daughters , yeah
mhm
yeah
Th- , they had the same , maybe just
problems and , and different , she hasn't been with her children for ten years
Her , or her two girls
ah
And they're twelve and ,
they're no they're nine and
thirteen or something like that
yup , but she's , she's working very hard
She's trying to become a counselor in this drug program , and things and
and she sounds like she's really trying hard
And I , and I just believe it's you know time ,
you know and , who would have ever thought it though , you know what I mea
Does she know that you're Musli
mhm
mhm
uhhuh
yup
yup
yup and
So th- , that's been my most interesting things in the last three weeks
oh that's some deep , that's just too deep
yup
yup
mhm
yup
Been very , very , very , heavy
From like mom said she said even if it was going to be in September , she said the little things I can tolerate you know
if if that happens you know
But you know I always worried I said you know even after you left I said , I just hope Arlita knows that I ch- , you know I tried my best you know and
Everybody has to keep them , Selema , everybody , everybody
You know , and I told her I said you know it's a shame that you can't go no place and , and I can get a go- , good report on you
you know , and um , and by her going to Francis and things , and ,
and , and Francis seeing for herself , she was like whoa
Did had did Francis feel she had changed a_lo
oh yes
t- , oh yes
You know , mhm , mhm
a- , ah
um , but , but um , but you know I feel very at peace about everything
uhhuh
I feel very at peace you know
Well it's good to hear from Francis who's had a_lot_of child-
Yes
Over six hundred
oh
Over six hundred foster children
oh
Yes
mhm

Goodness
Wait , wait , did they do it , like the same thing they had to do last tim
No
You know wha
That same thing happened to Aliah

She had to take all that stuff the first time but then the second time
Nope
She
yup
yup
j- , j- , and , and mom , mom said , I mean Jasmine was about two months old mom said oh goodness
eh , I mean cause Jasmine's not , Jasmine is not nowhere like my other other little babies
She is not cuddly sweet
mm , mm , no w-
She don't have time for that uh
She does not sit still or lay still for you to change her Pampers
This little girl moves
I mean sh- you lay her down on the bed she gets up and she runs from , well she doesn't run but she crawls real fast
And she has t- aw
And you're like okay
And she's not a cuddly sweet little thing , she , and she climbs up the stairs , Selema
She's seven months old and she's climbing up the stairs
Climbs down the stairs and mom said so we found out , when did we find out Barbara was pregnan
Last week , we found out and mom told her
Mom said mom said , Barbara , m- Jasmine is just moving she's moving out the way too
too quickly she's just she just was not a little sweet little cuddly
you know , no way
uh lay there let me look at my grandmother kind of thing
No no way not at not one bit
oh oh what a- Amway is probably going to have a rule though I could just
I just got back from the gym
oh good
uhhuh
How's it goin
oh pretty well
It was really crowded today
yeah
I kind_of assumed everyone would be at the shore
uhhuh
I was wrong
Well it's the middle of the week or whatever so
But it's the fourth of July
mm
So
yeah
People have to work tomorrow
Do you have to work tomorro
yeah
Did you have off yesterda
Yes
oh that's good
And I was paid too
oh
Is it paid toda
No
oh
But
yeah , so the gym's going well
oh
But I still need to go more often
Well how often are you goin
Only four days a week
yeah
Got to get that up to five
mm
But , I don't really like going with Anne Marie because she doesn't like to stay very long
Wh
I don't know
She kind of , well unfortunately for some reason she's not like into cardio vascular
So when I'm still riding the bike she's completely finished her weight lifting e- , routine
mhm
And like I haven't even started mine
mhm
You know and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular
mhm
It's true
And that lifting the weights won't lose weight
mm mm
You won't lose it , you know , but
No I mean you might lose some but that's only when yo-
For a woman who is lifting not that much I don't think
yeah
You would
I mean yeah I mean the only thing is just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time
yeah , So I don't know maybe she'll catch on soon
You do burn a_lot_of calories an hour though , lifting weights
uhhuh
But yeah I mean you're not going to , I don't think you're going to lose that much
n- , and also lifting weights at Bally's means you're standing on line as for as much time as you're actually lifting
Really
yeah
That's too bad
yeah
So it's is it really overcrowde
Well , I mean obviously since I work I can't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there
mhm
mhm
But I me- I'm sure for people who go in the daytime it's probably dead
yeah
You know and I go um , like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings it's totally dead
mhm
So
But you know
the weeknights is pretty crazy
yeah
yeah
I found a gym yesterday here that's only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars , twelve fifty
oh yeah
Wow
yeah
It's at the hospital nearby
Well that's a deal
yeah
yeah
So
uhhuh
I think tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up
Even Charlie's going to joi
No , but it has to be debited from a bank account so it's got to be debited from his
yeah
In your letter you said that he eats constantly
ohmygod
Reall
Alice , I've never seen anybody eat as much as he does and he's so skinny
mhm
I mean
the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals
yeah
and we go through a box of cereal every two days
Reall
yeah
Wow
He eats at least like four of cereal a day like in addition to like meals
uhhuh
And when he goes to work he brings four sandwiches with him ,
uhhuh
a bag of potato chips
uhhuh
um and you know and then little sweetie things
chocolates and cakies and stuff like that
uhhuh
And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like two fried eggs
mhm
on toast with cheese
um
vegetarian sausages
um and like like fruit and ohmygod it's just crazy
mhm
It's crazy how much he eats
He was probably starving when he was here
yeah
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal
He likes Cocoa Pops
oh boy
Wow
That's pretty crazy
yeah
It's all about being a blue collar man
I guess so
They're the ones who can eat all day
Reall
Well I mean he does work his ass off so
yeah
But
hm
hm
So , I , I assume it's hard for you not to eat as much as he does
No
I learned quick fast in a hurry because I've gained so much weight
oh reall
yeah
Actually in the first week I was here /
mhm
I gained a_lot so
Well it's hard to you know not eat when so- , when somebody else is eating
Well
I'm figuring it out fast because /
okay
with not working out and all
yeah
it's pretty miserable my , my crunch tape
mm
So I called this woman today
and um , she's a dressmaker and we're going to go see her next Thursday and talk about the , her making my wedding dress
Slate green
yeah
uh
See , that way I can have exactly what I want
Exactly
And it's only like , it's only going to be about two hundred and fifty pounds which is about three hundred and fifty dollars
uhhuh
So it's pretty good I mean comparatively
yeah
And it'll be exactly what I want and it'll look good on me , you know like fit me ,
Sure
which is necessary at the moment because I'm plump so
mhm
Now , daddy got the invitations together for you today
uhhuh
And in it I put , paint samples from Sherwin Williams
uhhuh
of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of
for the bride's maids
uhhuh
oh I already told them all black but dad doesn't want black he said
Mom and dad won't have black
They don't want blac
They're really o- opposed to it
di-
Did you call Sharon and tell her tha
No
Could you do tha
okay
Could you call Kate and tell her tha
yeah
Just say you know my parents are really opposed to black
yeah
They won't buy me a black dress
They won'
Here wait
Let me look for my phonebook
No
Never mind
I can just open the , the thing here
Now wait
What , god we got so much furniture in this tiny apartment
It's crazy
There's drawers everywhere , to figure out where everything is
okay
Let me give you Kate's phone number
You can just leave a message
okay
okay
two one , two one two
uhhuh
two two six
uhhuh
O one two five
okay
okay
I'll do that
But uh , yeah , apparently like at Lisa Manachi's wedding like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were
Reall
Like everyone at mom and dad's table
yeah
Who was at mom and dad's tabl
Weirdo
All the , just all of Lorraine's friends
mhm
Who you know o- , of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before
mhm
But
yeah , and Adele still talks about the black dress
Wha
How hideous they were
Adele wasn't at Lisa Manachi's
Adele went to the mass wedding
She di
uhhuh
oh
And she wanted me to take her and I refused to go and she got mad
Reall
Well I said , I said I , I would not feel comfortable going
I was not invited
mhm
You know and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that's a mass is open to everyone
I was like well that's fine but I don't , I would not feel comfortable going
mhm
I think that would be obnoxious and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me
Right
To the /
you know the other thing , the reception
I won't , I just wouldn't go
mm
So they had to take it down and drive her home
mm
So they're always kind of pissy at me
mm
That's okay
yeah
yeah
I mean I've been thinking about it and the black's not going to be so hot you know but
mhm
yeah
Apparently they were also carrying lillies
which is kind of goofy
yeah
Well I guess she did that to , because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the
symbol of the virgin Mary
mhm
White lillie
White lillies and black dresses
mm , my goodness
That's funny
yeah
yeah
Adele was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral and she had to keep reminding herself
mm
So now did you , do you think , you think my wedding's going to be pretty tasteful righ
But
oh yeah
Now what about the matchbook
Well I'll work on it
I still think about the matchbooks
yeah
I'll , I'll tell dad that you still think about the
Don- I haven't forgotten those and they'll still be enough time when I come home for me to order those
yeah
I'll have remind him of that little /
item
yeah
huh how fun- You know I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day /
and she's telling me about you know her sister's wedding
And at her sister's wedding they uh , they provided champagne and beer
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it
mhm
yeah
that's fo- , f- , that's actually kind of common but it's /
oh it is
it's pretty declasse
Well I kind of thou- , I mean of course I didn't say anything to her
yeah
You know I said w- , as far as I knew we weren't charging people
yeah
Now
But uh , yeah dad's already Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day
And there were having a sale
on the wine dad wanted
Are you talking to m
Of course I'm talking to you
I can hardly hear you
oh
I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something
I'm talking to you
oh yeah
No dad told me that
oh he did tell you
It's all Chilean
yeah
yeah
Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or /
mm
something like that
I don't know
mm
The- , There's a pretty good sale so
mm
So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale
An- , do you know if Jack called Spencer ye
I told him this morning to do it this , this week
uhhuh
And he kind of , he just keeps forgetting
yeah
But o-
How's he doin
Much better
yea
yeah
He's of- , he's often chipper
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen
Pe-
ohmygod
Is that because he's not sleeping and
Well because he couldn't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom
oh
So I think it's time to give all the cats a bath
mm
yeah and the- , you should do that
I know
It's a two person job though
I'll have to get somebody to help me
mm
yeah
hm
hu
What pric
uh , free
Free
which is even better , yes
Wow
mhm
But what about yo
uh , then I'll work on me
uh because see if I don't
I , if I don't get back like next week it's no big deal
I could just stay here
So it's not important for me
Right
You se
So the main thing is to get your , your deal
So you might not come back her
Right
Got you
See I'm only be there for like three or four days
Right
So I mean if it's going to cost me an arm and a leg it's cheaper if I just stay here
Right
So you don't need
Because I don't have to do anything but work that day so
Right
Well what happens to your work the
Well I just won't do it
But I mean if I have to pay you know , a thousand dollars it's not
expeditious to make a thousand and
That's a big word
Those crosswords are making you use big words
pay a thousand
Is that what it i
Getting bette
uhhuh
mhm hm
That's the purpose
uhhuh
Increase your word power
mhm
So
Well
you know that would , that would be the
the thing
I mean
there's no way I'm sure you're not going to get back
you know within a day or two of the time
You know because there're eighteen hundred flights that
that go back
I'm not on American
On American
On American
They go from London
oh this is a flight to Londo
Right
I see
Right
And then just get the connecting flight
Can you get me a connecting fligh
Well that shouldn't be a problem
Susan said there's no inter-Europe flights
Right
Right
No , I can go down to the place here and
Sure
Sure
uh nothing's uh possible with Susan
No , everybody who doesn't have a ticket a month ago is not going to fly for the rest of the year
So you don't want a ticket to Milan , for nine hundred dollar
Well again that's the point
I mean if it's going to cost that
uh
It's easier for me just to get yours than
not do one
okay
You se
mhm
I'm eating a banana , excuse me
It just
I see
You know it just depends on if you would
just like the
you know stand by that's the
Well
You know to have a sh- you know
And I'd have to stand by in London by myself
uhhuh
Like a big girl , yes
Yes Exactly
but exactly
That's the , that's the thing
You know we just pick a ,
Amazing
just pick a day you know like probably the Tuesday
like the first of August
would be the best time
Right
um Mondays sometimes people coming back but uh , you know nobody leaves on Tuesdays
Well do you think it would be better to come like on that Friday the twenty first and then I'd be closer to the middle of August anyway
uh , well I mean that's some-
Can we do tha
mm that's something you could do
uh , you know the other thing is
Because if you're not coming anyways then
Right
I don't have to fly with you so I could just come that Friday
Right
Well , the other thing is is that you could just stay longer
Right
Exactly
Get a short flight
Just stay longer
Well , yeah , but
mhm
Maybe you came like the twenty first uh ,
It would be uh a little over three weeks instead of
Right
mhm
I think I should go back to work but I think it would be better if I came on the twenty first that way then
uhhuh
If you can change it
Well I can probably change it
Because that way
oh
I'll be closer to the middle of August and
hopefully if there's , when the problems arise with David Steel , I'm not going to even say if
um ,
I can resolve it from here and not have it ruin my vacation
uhhuh
Right
oh that's true
You know I'd rather not have to be doing that craziness and I'd still be there for B B King and Etta James
duh , duh , buh , buh , duh duh
They uh , they ther
Wha
What day are they t- , her
Hold on
You don't have the paper
oh
Well I no I got it
I g-
uh they're here , they're here the twenty third so yeah you'd get here the twenty second
It is true
um
You know and if they didn't have room on the twenty first I could come the twentieth just a few days , by myself a few days
uhhuh
Right
Right
okay
um ,
Where was that paper by the wa
Which pape
The paper that
I copied it for you and gave it to you
No
No
I mean where was it when you told me I had it and I told you you had it
Who had i
I don't know
I don't know
Where did it come from
It's history It's history detective
Who , where did it come fro
The important thing is that we have it
I want to be able to say I told you so
No
No
No
I I No , I know that
I know that
I know that well
That's the most important thing in your life
Yes
No
I know that very well
Yes
You're just not happy to have it
You have to get some , got to get some justice
I told you dumb shit
No
I , I know the program
It's tough
It's tough
uh , so what I'll do then is then I'll go ahead and get it then
okay
um
Will you have any money I can stand b
I've got
Like go get a hotel if I have t
oh I'll have some money by then
oh right
uh , no
Right
Everybody will have the stuff by then
yeah
That won't be a problem
mhm
Won't be a problem
um
The sixteenth you'd have to stay over in Boston anyway
uh if you did that
But again that's not , see I , that one wasn't even available the last time I called
Right
they said call because people do cancel
Right
And so you know during the time we just call
on a daily basis just
Sure
changing
That's groovy
But it's not a problem
I'm excited
The only problem will be the ticket to get to London
But I'll see if we can get a one way
and then buy another one way going back
Where's this ticket , this ticket is to Mila
uh no get it to Nice , from London to Nice
Right
Right
No
I mean coming , when I leave L A the where do I fly t
Londo
London
mhm yeah
And then I'll have to take a boat because there's no , no inter-Europe's according to Susan
ah
Right
Exactly
All the people in Europe are paralyzed
yep
No
It's , it's great
Well let me know
uh no
I'll go ahead and do it
okay
And I'll go and talk to the person here cause they get cheap tickets
okay
from London to Nice and stuff
Is Neil still ther
uh yep
yep
yep
Exactly
He's never going home
uh let's see Saturday
Saturday
Saturday we went out to dinner with uh , Georgio
the other night
uhhuh
And
had a really good meal
We'll go there again when you come
okay
It's really good restaurant
They were people who went to the jazz festival with me last year
They own the restaurant
oh sure
So they'll probably want to go with us this year
That's fine
Nice people
Cool
Cool
Cool
Cool yes yes
So have any of your things close
No
Nothing
Nothing
I just had a nice dream though that David
is was just fine
uhhuh
That he got his money in today like he's supposed to
Right
That was a dream
So he still hasn't made any inroad
uh uh
Nothing hu
He's having trouble closing his station
uhhuh
It may not happen
ohgod
If that doesn't happen he'll commit suicide
The statio
Right
If he doesn't get the station
Probably
He'll commit suicide
He'll be in bad shape
mhm
and then that's because everybody involved will get sued
What do you mea
Everybody involve
Does that mean Shirl Cla
Probably
Wh
I don't think they can but I think they'll try
You know how people are
About the fall one you mea
yeah
yeah
trying to figure out
Well , I told
I told him too that I'll mention to him again
on Monday but
he doesn't , h- , he's not , well of coarse Mister_Oharshi
is not always
prompt in his answer either but
but maybe Mister_Furobiashi too will
Well , I was just wondering maybe I should , should I just pick a date and , and
say I'm coming
yeah , because I think , you know , at first we were talking about that
trying to work it in with the festival but I don't think it's going to be good because of the fact
Right
that we
f- foreign teachers many of us want to go down to that
Sure
which is right after you know which we'll leave like on the Friday night
uh , the third and then be down for the fourth and fifth
mhm
So , so I think probably just work it in to your
general scheduling you know like you've done before and not bother hit it on that weekend
We- ,
yeah
okay
Well I'm , um , what I was trying to figure
I asked some of the students here whether they thought it was better to arri- , to be there before or after the fall festival and they said after
uhhuh
Do you agre
Yes
Well , mainly because there are ,
especially if it's just the few days before , that's when the students finally get down to preparing for the festival and so those days are really pretty
yeah
pretty busy
And so after the festival it's , uh , they're freer , a_lot freer so if you could make it after that weekend
What about , just , I'm looking at the calendar trying to figure , what about , say on November
say if I were there November n-
either come in on the ninth or you know the evening of the eighth from wherever , I probably will already finish the other countries
uhhuh
Maybe make it , make Japan the last place
Last , yeah
uhhuh
um , come in on the either the eighth or ninth , and then leave there on Saturday the eleventh
How are , what are those days , do you know what those days might be lik
Would those be good day
Eighth , or eighth and nint
n- or ninth and tenth
uh , ni- , ninth is yes obviously we have our our special chapel
that week but that's just second period it's just that there are , there's , there are no classes second period
and the students have this special chapel but , but even- , you know evenings for a meeting or something would be fine
I'd like to meet with the parents again , that seemed to be
so well received , uh , last time
mhm
um , and we've got of coarse some more parents
yeah , it's
um , and now we're getting a few graduates going back
uhhuh
that graduated this year
yeah
So , uh , you know , it's the beginning of a
much
bigger /
y- , y- , y- , you would come in on the ninth the
group
Either that or say the at- , late afternoon or the evening of the eighth
okay
We have a
You know I I haven't
English department faculty meeting on the eighth , but
And that goes until what tim
Well it d- they don't start until five ten
oh , okay
Five ten till
So it would be better to come in on , like the morning of the ninth
or like before noon on the nint
yeah
Or around noon or whatever
yeah , it w- ,
yeah
it would be okay
oh
uh , okay
Put down A M and then leave Saturday , um , sometime
uhhuh
Whenever
Because I've been trying to put this together but I didn't know how to , to organize it
I really wanted to organize it
yeah
uh , you know J C J C has been the
kingpin of this
uh , group
Now Mister_Furobiashi the last time I did hear from t- , or , no I guess it was one of the girls that , a graduate that was just over there
and came back and she said when she talked to him
that he indicated there were not many interested in studying in the U S because they were a a not very motivated group
yeah
This , the present check at your students , yeah
Now i- , m- , my first y- , the first year we have about seventeen or eighteen in the study abroad class
Great
In the first year , so a- and the- , and this , the first year bunch are different I mean they
oh
they seemed to be more motivated so it c- , it's true that I'm not sure how many there will be in the second although there are two second year students in the class this year
mhm
So , uh ,
but I don't know where , I I'm not , I haven't talked to them yet to see where they would be
Now , they're interested or just wha
what they're thinking about
mhm
um , well , you can , can , uh ,
talk with them and see if they're
uh whether they're interested in studying , actually studying abroad or planning on it or anything then we'll know a little better
uh-uh
whether I need to have two days there
yeah
or I could fly in in the morning and out the next morning , or , you know , what would , what would work best
mhm
cause I don't want to , I don't want to wear out my welcome
Excuse me for coughing on this
Well , no , that's okay
My goodness
That was a native speaker's cough
oh
And , uh , you know it's not that he can't
He's got the smarts
yeah
He's just been a little bit unmotivated
mhm
uh , June is doing much better
yeah
uh , she had , uh , i- , it was a hard start
She kept g- , falling asleep in class
You can't do that in an American classroom
mhm
yeah
And , uh , you know she was trying to memorize the whole book
and were saying no you've got to use the book , you know you've got to use the vocabulary
We don't care if you memorize it
We don't care if you make mistakes
mhm
You've just got to try to use it
She was looking for perfection
mhm
She's relaxing a little bit and , um , is coming along Hiroki unfortunately he's doing , he's , you know , minimal
mhm
He's doing the minimal
But there is another Japanese girl in his class who didn't come through J C J C she's a high school graduate
mhm
and is very unmotivated , very poor attitude i- attitude and is just
um , really resistant
I'm not quite sure why she's here you know
uhhuh
and Hiroki has appointed himself as her protector
oh dear
and consequently she's failing
mm
and she should be by her testing she should be the top student in the class
oh
she could be easily
but she's just
you know just
puts on the air that she's not interested and
mhm
we had some knock down drag outs with her
mm
She's just really immature the other Japanese girls say , oh , she's just
you know , i- it's immaturity
mhm
But , uh , because he
just
identifies with her
mhm
you know he is not performing to where he could perform or should perform
mhm
And so when she's not around he does better
uh b- you know , not great but better
mm
So he , and it's real interesting , you know , I don't know at what point I will call up his cousin , you know his aunt and uncle live here
yeah , I know mhm
in town
and uh , this has got to be a little bit of a problem because his cousin is a gal
she just passed the bar exam and has set up her own law practice
oh , brother
a_lot_of people who come from two different religio- , religions go there
oh yeah
yeah , okay
yeah
mhm hm
So it was wonderful and
And then what was the , um , reception lik
Well we went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line , and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes , and
uhhuh
we played softball , and , uh , volleyball , and four square , and had dancing and m- music and great food , and
Wow , that sounds like a_lot_of fun
It was
Wow
It sounds like it was great
yeah everybody , a_lot_of people told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to , and that's , I guess , the highest compliment you can get
Wow
So , and where , did you guys go on a honeymoo
We went on a honeymoon to this island off the coast of Puerto Rico
oh god
In the Carribean
But i- , the hardest part was getting there
I mean , we had to take three planes to get there
But the
We got this book from my mom about the Carribean
And , um
I'd always wanted to go to the Carribean
So we just decided okay , we'll go
We only went for five days
It was pretty short but , um
uhhuh
The place was totally laid back
It was this old plantation house that , um , had
this twenty four rooms
And , and , they said in the book like you won't be able to tell the guests from the staff
And
mhm
um , it , it was really , really cool
And they have , you know , i- , mismatched sheets and stuff
It wasn't fancy at all , but it was really cheap
And
uhhuh
They just had the bar open all the time
You could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guest ticket
And
ohmygod
They picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast , and stuff
It was great
Wow , it sounds idyllic
It was really tiny , so , the island is only ten miles long
uhhuh
um
But it was , it was good cause i- , you know , everybody speaks English , and , and yet it's still pretty exotic , you know
uhhuh
We went snorkeling
And , it wa-
God , it sounds great
That's something I really regret is that Norm and I didn't have a honeymoon
yeah , well you should go on one anyway
yes
yeah , we were planning on going one , on one one of these days , but I don't know now what's going to happen
Well , you'll just have to take your kid
I know I think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people we're going on our honeymoon
How big are yo
um , well actually I've only gained four pounds
uhhuh
But is it showin
Which is not a_lot for , you know , for how far I am , but I'm , I'm definitely pregnant
yeah
I mean I have all of the
You know I need to give myself the extra support when I get up
And
uhhuh
You know , like , you know how when you're
You know like when I get up , like , you know like how wide you put your feet apart when you get u
uhhuh
Well I have to probably put my feet like five inches further apart and kind of hoist myself up sort_of like
uhhuh
So
Which is pretty funny
yeah , I'm definitely pregnant
But I'm not huge by any means
But i- , y- , what are you five and a half months no
yeah
So , it's it's just starting to get into the part where you start to show
And
uhhuh
start to get big and the whole bit
But it's weird
Like , you go like , um ,
like I'm , I'm not fatter in anywhere
uhhuh
Except my stomach
I mean it honestly looks like I swallowed
I mean it's really weird
Like
I can see
You can s- I've never really like been up close to a pregnant woman before but you know , like I've seen them at the gym and stuff like that , but never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that I could like actually look at her
uhhuh
But you can see the line of your uterus
You can see in your stomach where it is
It's like this big circle
and it sticks out in that big circle
And it's filling up with a /
yeah
thing
An alien presence
That's totally what it feels like
Really
Does it move around ye
oh yeah
He , he , he kicks a_lot
I don't , I don't know that it's a he , but I call him he
He kicks a_lot
He's been kicking for about five weeks now
huh
But , um , he just started this week
He started rolling that I can feel
I mean they roll the whole time , but now I can feel him rolling , and it's totally bizarre
It's
Do you have a name for it , I mean like a , you know a joke name that you call i
Like
No
I've heard some really good ones
But
The only one that I came up with was Thumper , cause he just kicks so much
He's really an active baby
Thumper
Well that's good
yeah
Healthy
Well , also the monster child is the other thing I call him
The monster child Rosemary's baby
I know
Well , um
Because he kicks so much , it's really , you know , it's really annoying
I mean
Does it wake you u
No he hasn't woken me up yet , but if I wake up in the middle of the night , he is , he does kick and so you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up
What if it's a gir
Well , it's probably not a girl , because in our family , it's o- , if you go on both sides of our family , and you look at all our first cousins , and everything , it's like seventy five percent male
huh
But it might be a girl
I was positive it was a girl
Like the first three months , I was absolutely positive it was a girl
And then I changed my mind an-
now she is a boy
Well that'll be a surprise then
yeah , yeah
I don't know
Are you going to ask them not to tell you if you had
oh we're not having an ultrasound
uhhuh
Because it's really like ,
We went and looked up all this research
There's all this stuff
You'll see when you get pregnant
And ,
If , if you want to know , just send me email
Because I looked up a bunch of stuff , but , there's all this research like on , there's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now
It's not just amnio , it's like other stuff too
uhhuh
And then there's also , um ,
you know , the , the , uh , the ultrasound
But in fact , like
if you look at the l , the la- , the latest research on ultrasound , it's like , they really don't know
Like they assume that it's safe , because , you know , they've had it for twenty years , right
And nothing has happene
They never
Ye- , well they don't know
They've never really done any big studies on it or anything
But the but if you're a normal , low , like there's reasons to have an ultrasound
And if you have to have an ultrasound , then it's a really good diagnostic tool , righ
Right
But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it's not a good diagnostic tool at all
Like ,
is they find as many , um , false positives as they do false negatives
For , for spina_bifida and stuf
Well the only thing they can really check , they can check the heart
uhhuh
And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain
And then they can do like
yeah
But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has , um ,
ah
Defects of various kinds
Like Down's Syndrome
Like sometimes y- But that's not really very good
Like amnio is the only sure way to find out
Right
But it could give you like some indications that the baby might have Down's or something
But it's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancies
So ,
yeah
I didn't bother getting one
yeah , good
I'm sure everything will be fine
oh yeah
And if it's not , it's like , you know , you're going to have to deal with it anyway
Well what are you going to do I mean , if it's not , like and we didn't do any of the testing because , like ,
I , I've met like three people since I got pregnant , where the baby had Down's , right
They found out the baby had Down's
And they aborted it
They had , well , it's not called abortion , it's called termina-
Termination , that's right
And I jus- , I just couldn't have done that
I just
We talked about it a little bit , you know what I mean
Like
obviously I don't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that
But
But if it does , you'll deal with it
I just could not have done that
So it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing
Because , you know
If you're not going to abort anyway , then there's no reason to have it
yeah
I mean there are like some , there are some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life
Right
But then I figured , well , I'll just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then the baby will die when it's born
You know
If it's like that
yeah
yeah , we had this friend
This is not supposed to scare you , it's just because it was on the topic
But , um , but , the baby died at like eight and a half months
mm
I know
I read so many of those stories
They just freak me out
You know
And of course they make you have , give birth anyway
You know you can't have an
You have to
I mean what are
I mean that's how you have an abortion is you give birth you kn-
yeah
And it's dead you know it's dead
And it's a hassle , you know
And you've got to go through all that pain knowing the baby's not even alive anyway
yeah
But , you know
She's a pregnant again
You know , sh- , they're fine
And what happened to the bab
Do they kno
They got over it
I think it got either strangled by its cord or some kind of
yeah that's what they g- They always say that g-
They say that but
cord accident
It's an it was an accident
It's like they don't know
yeah , you know
It's like something happened
Or , or maybe it
it went into
oxygen deficiency or something
Like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time ,
yeah
mhm
and so she didn't even know it until the next morning
And
It was something like that
Wow
That is so scary
But obviously , you know , y- , when you have a baby
for the rest of its life and your life , you have to worry that it might die , you know , or something will happen to it
oh I know it is so scary
It's awful
That's got to be the worst thing
Well anyhow , did you get to meet your nephew at your ,
I did
The baby Jack is huge
at the wedding
He's , he's four months and he's like eighteen pounds
ohmygod
The kid is ado- But it's all breast milk
That's huge
That's like the size of a two year old isn't it
He's huge
He's , he's the shape of a , of a small ch- baby but you know , he's big He's heavy
oh , you better hope that that doesn't run in the family
How big was he when he was born
Well
He was normal size when he was born
Like eight and a half pounds
ok-
okay
yeah
But , um , my brothe- , you know , my uncle is like six foot four , and my brother is big , and , on Gaelin's side of the family there's big people too
So , I mean , he could just be a big boy
That's I mean eighteen pounds
That is humongous
Eighteen pounds from breast milk alone in four months
ohmygod
And yet he's small
You know , he doesn't l- look that huge
He's not very long or anything he's just
uhhuh
And he's not chub- He's chubby but he's
He just weighs
He's hefty
yup yeah well they don't you know they just tell you feed on demand
I mean if they want to eat that much you let them eat that much
and and he's healthy and all so you know she's just like oh well
uhhuh
uhhuh
And do they seem happy and
um I know Cynthia through Rach
oh so she yeah so she is
and so it's kind of like a roundabout thing and I we don't talk that much I see her occasionally we all go out
oh yeah
um but not all that much I'm with Rachel constantly so it's funny that I don't see her more actually
yeah
but yeah
well now she's with Kurth
yeah constantly
I'm so happy for her though he's such a nice guy
he is nice and they're good together
yeah
and now they're going up for the wedding aren't they
yeah uhhuh
yeah because she was trying to get me to go with them and I was like
this was before I even knew about the Spain thing and I was like I don't know I want to go so bad
and I said but I don't have a date and then she's like go with us
yeah
so then I was thinking about it and then when I got this offer to go to Madrid I was like
oh I'd much rather go visit them in /
Spain then I can see all the wedding pictures
yes
I thought that would be great
so when are you going
I think I might go Thanksgiving that week
uhhuh and you're just staying for one week
yeah
okay
and I'm going to take I think I'm going to take some resumes around
yeah really
I miss it so much
do you
do you miss it now
no not at all
You don't
No
I guess you lived there long enough to get it all out of your system
yeah well now get this we might go to live in Switzerland
oh really
yeah because they've made him a job offer there and at first he's thinking nah he wasn't going to take it but now he's like
well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then
maybe he could get in his foot in the door with because they've united with A T T
uhhuh
and then you know the Swiss phone company whatever and /
telefonika
so he's thinking well that would he'd get his foot in the door with A T T so it w-
would might be easier to come back here later
right
and at first I thought oh yeah it would be nice to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain and
right
you know we could learn German but
that's true
I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go it's
like no not another problem not another move
yeah you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning
right yeah
that's true when would he be going
I don't know
um
be going
he said as soon as possible like October
ohmygod
I know
then you wouldn't even be there
I know but
oh my goodness
I don't think we're going I hope not I mean I'd like it under other circumstances but
right is that what he eventually wants to get back to the States
yeah uhhuh yeah
well that's good that's good for you because then you know that it isn't a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain
alright well we don't know hopefully it's not
yeah yeah
so
that's funny that you're still sick of it that makes me laugh because I miss it so much
I think I just miss the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored
yeah and probably when you were there yeah you were there because you wanted to be you weren't w- and you were working because you wanted to work there not because you had to like
yeah but it's just
you have to work
I just
things I just hate everything
well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and
my job is okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's just
well that's cool
I don't know
I hate my job so much ohmygod I can't wait like next well my last day is Thursday but
oh c-
I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so happy
oh that's great
yeah
well do you need the extra time though
yeah
because it's coming up fast
you know oh they're just coming on Saturday next Saturday
oh my goodness
yeah week from tomorrow
oh that'll be fun
or a week from whenever
and have you heard from Ellen and Reuben are they going up
she wasn't sure because well she said ei- either
well she said she would definitely come or at least try to come but Reuben might not because they're going to Spain first
and then they're coming back here so then they thought maybe they'd come directly from
Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it costs extra money
so she wasn't sure what she was doing or how she was going to do it
yeah
but I think she's definitely going to come
oh that's good
as long as they can swing it yeah but I don't know if they'll
and Erica I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her
yeah but he was here I think around
a long time ago
yeah Christmas time and supposedly he was coming back in August but I don't know because I heard
well I heard it from Alberto who heard it from Sanju who heard it from Caroline
ohgod
so who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them
oh
so I don't know
but she'll be up for the wedding right
I don't know because I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming because she had to work or something on Friday
oh
but I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not so
oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse
I know
then you wonder oh my goodness
well my friends I have two friends from France coming
oh that's good
yeah
wow and is his family coming from Spain
just his two sisters
well that's good
yeah
that's good do they speak English
no not really
oh good that'll be fun
and they don't they don't really want to come either
oh God
but that's okay
oh I
I don't really want them to come either
yeah oh yeah that's right because you didn't get along well with his family
yeah they're not very nice well his cousins and everything seems really nice and they've written back letters and stuff and they seem all
excited to meet me and they're like we can't wait to meet our new cousin and stuff like that so
oh
well that's neat
yeah
and then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or what are your plans
I'm just going to not work for a while and
that's a good idea
see what happens yeah
oh goodness
yeah
you have a_lot to do
I know and I've got to ship all this stuff over there we've taken out a loan
I can imagine because how else would you get everything
I know
oh my goodness
what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you
it is yeah but then I have a friend here who she's married and she has three little kids and she's moving to Seattle and she's going to start studying
oh my goodness
and her husband is just quitting he's going to quit his job here and like look when he once he gets out there so
at least she's kind of going through the same thing
exactly
so yeah I don't feel so alone
yeah I was thinking about actually doing a master's in Madrid
oh really
and working like at working like at a T G I Friday's or someplace where I know they'd hire me
oh right
and then just working on a master's during the day and working at night
who would you go with like N Y U or Middlebury
I don't know I'm trying to find an American university that has master's programs
N Y U has one for one year
and I
Spanish Amigamato
I get a masters in one yea
yeah
yeah
yeah
in Madrid
yep
the whole year
yeah and then
I don't have to study at all in the States
no uh-uh
ohmygod Spanish Marcelene thankyou I'm going to write that down
yeah and then Middlebury College you know in they have
uhhuh
you have to go for one summer to but it's just the summer and then you do one year in Madrid and you get a master's
wow okay N Y U and what was the o- Middlebury
yeah
I'm going to go research them at Wash U this weekend then because
I'm just bored I don't know if it's just b- because I'm single and bored and there's like nobody in the midwest who's twenty eight single /
no
and and straight
oh
no
most of my friends are single I was just saying like
I mean I'm not the first one to get married at all but still I'm still in like that first bunch
oh really
yeah
oh my wave must have struck early then because everybody I know is married or getting married and I'm so jealous
oh really
in fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend exboyfriend I don't know what he is but we're always together
about your wedding and I was like I'm so excited
he's going to be out of town or else I'd make him go and we'd go but
I was like I'm just so excited for her I said oh she's so lucky and then they're going to go live in
Spain and blah and he's just like okay okay I'm sick of your friends
that's all I talk about I'm just so happy for everybody
but then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and I'm like stuck
oh but it'll be worth the wait believe me I know how you feel
it's horrid
I know
and you don't know what to do and like I can't seem to adjust to the family thing
yeah th- well there's nothing you really can do
I know
just when you least suspect it that's when it'll happen
yeah that's true well believe me I haven't been looking or waiting I'm like
now tell me about this guy because I know I remember now that you told me something about him
it's the same one believe it or not
yeah
he was supposed to actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it until October
oh really
yeah he's in Korea right now for three weeks and then he's in Spain for two weeks
so what's he doing in in Missouri
he works for Arthur Andersen
oh oh that's right okay
in Madrid and they sent him yeah and so he's on loan or whatever
but he says wimpy things don't you hate when guys say like
oh if things if if we if things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with
oh yeah but
oh that's such a wimp thing to say
yup
because if they really wanted to spend the rest of their lives with you they would make things different
right exactly
and I just looked at him and I thought you know y- you guys suck
so what's wr- what's wrong now with your relationship according to him
just the fact that w- he's leaving and I'm not going to answer the other line because /
oh
I'm on long distance just because he said well in October I'm going back to Spain first it was July and then he extended it
and I saw his list of reasons why he'd extend and I was number one
oh really
and I'm like oh that's good
yeah
but then he's like oh it's just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much
uhhuh
that he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine
oh right
but he doesn't realize that we live different lives
right
for me
you're willing to leave /
it's like it's no big deal because /
at the drop of a hat yeah
I know it's like just say the word and I'm gone
but I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous
yeah well you did that already right
yeah
I did that once
I don't want to do that again so I don't know
well but maybe if you go in November he'll see you know
yeah it'll be different it'll be different to be over there and see him
so where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid
yeah he lives well he lives by Avenido_de_America
oh okay
he lives like toward the airport
uhhuh
which is good and his dad works at a bank his mother is French
oh really
yeah she
does he speak French
Yes he does , fluently
And guess who called here last night , looking for your addres

and he needs to know
a- whether there'll be more than one set up , or just one set up
just one
now the set up would be you know , everybody being photographed in the same place

but just tell him I want black velvet
hu

I have to think about that
okay , okay
we'll
I told him how many rolls I wanted
uhhuh
um , did he , I told him I wanted ten two and a quarter
okay , okay
but I think it might actually have to be more than ten
mhm
Well , I mean obviously , you know , the expenses go up the more he has to shoot
You know what I mea
yeah , yeah
Like there's a relationship between the number of rolls he shoots and the cost of the whole /
oh yeah
thing
no , I know , well yeah , because he has to take it to a place and then got a contact all of them and /
right
stuff like that
right , right Well will all of it be black and whit
um
yes
yes alright
and if it's not going to cost too much , I'd like to buy
one of the rolls , whichever roll is the nicest one
uhhuh
I'd like to buy that roll
uhhuh
okay
okay
okay , so you'll have to think about how many different shots there would be
like people setups
mhm
yeah
okay
and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itsel
I don't think so
what do you think
okay
I think it's tacky
yeah
no I don't think it either
okay
mommy never no- mommy and I did not have any at all
no
I think it's just going to , it's going to be hard enough , and
yeah right , and this g-
I , I don't need that
right and because in that environment I don't , I think you're right on that , I think it would be awkward
mhm
um , and so I think that's better actually , so , if yo- , if you know , this way he could
just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself
mhm
and what I would like to do
which you know I heard about people doing elsewhere , for the color ones during the meal
hm
is you know , put some of those disposable cameras on some tables and let , you know
mhm mhm
mhm
because then I'll , I'll be sure to get pictures from my friends and stuff
mhm , mhm
yeah , that's good
that's good everything
What do you think of tha
yeah that's fine
okay
yeah , I think that's fine
mhm
okay , well I told him I would get back to him
How many rolls did you tell hi
I told him ten two and a quarter , but
okay
it's going to , I think it's going to have to be more than that
uhhuh
like twelve to fifteen
uhhuh
yeah
okay
well anyway , what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people poses
mhm
yeah
no I do
uhhuh
because I mean , you know , he he ah , he has to allot enou- enough time in order to accomplish all of that
mhm
you know , it's not as if , and I mean I know what it's like at Drexel you know , when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken
mhm
uh , it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know and you have to take several shots of each grouping and
mhm
all of that can take a considerable amount of time
yeah
yeah , I'll I'll um , I'll I'll think about all that
yeah , okay and
yeah , I'm also going to have a a list of stuff , of music that I want the D J to play
yeah , okay well you know , any time you f- , you could probably let them know that when you come back here
you think so
I would think so
okay
I can call him and ask him , ah , but I , but I think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself
okay
but anyway , we'll find out about that
mm
I , um , i- you know the invitations have gone out , along with all of the information on travel in Philadelphia , I sent a map
mhm
mhm
lots of people can see how to get to the Art Alliance you know
oh that's nice dad
uh for all the people out of , from out of town
uhhuh
and then I also sent them information on hotels It turns out that the Barclay
okay
is actually the
right next door
it's actually the best deal , because they'll give me the best deal
oh really , wait , hold on , let me get a pen
to write this down
uhhuh
okay
I mean the Barclay , which is right across the street , will
Isn't it it's right next door , right
yeah , right directly across the street
okay
um , is um , I think it's ninety nine dollars
for a double , and eighty nine dollars for a single , is that what it is Ale
yeah , it's eighty nine for a single , and ninety nine for a double
okay , did you check on triples or no
ah , no I didn't but I could do that easily
okay
uh , I bic-
and at that , that's a deal , that's not
yeah , that's not the regular price the regular price is a hundred and twenty
the regular rat
okay , so we're taking twenty dollars of
yeah they're taking twenty dollars off
okay
at the Holiday Inn is actually the same price
the Holiday Inn
man that sounded cr- yucky
was
area
was ninety nine dollars
for a double , without a continental breakfast , and a hundred and fourteen dollars with the continental breakfast , I mean , that's for two
m-
so , at at the Barclay , do you get breakfas
no no that's the room
okay
okay
the room cost is that
okay
okay
mhm
but I mean you know as perf- as well as I do that all you , if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to Diner On The Square , two blocks away
yeah
exactly
and so um , you know in that area of Penn you can actually eat quite expens- , inexpensively
mhm
uh , because there are a_lot_of of Asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks
mhm
and so you know , it's a , it's a it
no , I mean there's Italian restaurants right around there too you know
yeah
I mean there are lots of places where people could eat
relatively inexpensively around the Barclay
yeah
um , and so that actually turned out to be the best deal
okay
uh , that could be arranged and so I you know sent a written
statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know what their options are
okay
and they all have the map as well
okay
okay
so all of that is working out quite nicely
okay
um , as it turns out , the , I think the bed and breakfast is cheaper that that
okay well I can find out about that I didn't do that yet
yeah , did , did you I , should I give you the name of i
The Reserve
Reserve
yeah , no , I didn't do that one yet
okay
uh , but I could do that and let you know
yeah , could you ask about whether they'll do triples there
uhhuh
and rooms with a bathroo
uhhuh
okay
Patroli's mother and grandmothers are going to be you know
uhhuh
Is his father not comin
no
okay
so it's the mother and the two grandmothers , and
and
his uncl
uh , no , his uncle's not coming here , he's com- , his uncle's going to be watching
the grandfather
oh , I see
um , no it's ah the person he works for who's like a really good family friend
oh , you mean the person Charlie works fo
yeah
oh
what's his name
nam
Graham
well that's what I thought was the uncle's name okay
no Peter is the uncle
okay
alright , so that's very nice
Did you send out the invitations that you go
no , not yet
okay
I I've just been at the
uh
you want to hear the weirdest thin
uhhuh
okay , today , I came out of the British Museum ,
and it's just packed , you know , with tourists
yes
whatever , and lots of Italians
uhhuh
and I went , out around the corner , and made a
call home and as I was standing in the phone booth there was this group of
pretty
fairly like like , mid teen age
year kids walking by
yeah
one of them was just staring at me
and don't tell me
okay you cou- , you c-
the young woman the in the house where you stayed in Florence
yes
ohmygod
Isn't that bizarr
and you talked to he
I , I , was staring at her , then I went out , and I couldn't remember where I'd seen her before
uhhuh
and
then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these Italian kids
yeah
yeah
and she just kept staring at me , and then as I got close she kind of like
yeah
walked around
like , behind one of her friends or something , like she was nervous or s- something
right , right , right
and I'm thinking , this is just too weird , and I didn't recognize it as her
right
and then I walk past the bus
and I turn around , and I just looked at her
uhhuh
and then I just started smiling , and she started smiling and so I kind of knew it was her and everything , but
uhhuh , uhhuh
but uh , isn't it craz
yeah , what was her name , Kiar
Kiara
yeah , that's what I thought
yeah
I thought huh
It is a small world
yeah
uh , so she was there with some sort of Italian group , hu
well , it was like a school group , or something because it was all kids you know like
yeah yeah
huh yeah right
fifteen , sixteen years old
right , visiting the British Museu
yeah
uhhuh okay , okay , very good
very good , I also incidentally called um , the marriage license bureau in Philadelphia
uhhuh
okay now if you're getting married on saturday the ninth ,
the latest date on which you can apply for the license is the preceding monday
uhhuh
the preceding Monday
um but although they solicit , they're trying to solicit more throughout the , throughout the globe instead of just Japan
mhm
although they've had most interest in Japan
mhm
And I teach probably two classes and then do administrative work to make connections for these people to have tours
or to go look at companies dealing with certain issues that they're working on in their classes Half of their classes are business half are English Eng- English business
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
So it's really groovy because I mean I have all these contacts for them because of my experience in the business world here
yeah
yeah
And you know and I do a little teaching for them too
okay
What classes did you teach at that would be relate
I taught , okay
I taught
I taught business English
uhhuh
I taught listening
I taught integrated skills and g- beginning grammar
okay
mhm
I'm just writing this down so I
Cool
You don't have to tell them about or anything oh weird
You know wha
Wha
I had a dream this morning about ,
it's weird
I don't know if you were in it
I think you were
huh
But Barry was definitely in it
yeah
And Barry and I
I don't know
We were trying to get somewhere and we had to jump in this water but she wouldn't let go of me when we got in the water and I woke up because I start drowning
I don't know what that means
I got a postcard from her too the other day
That's a
yeah
That's a scary dream
It was pretty scary
yeah
I don't know it was kind of one of those frustrating type dreams
eh w- listen
Was it difficult coming back , going back to the U
yeah
yeah
It was harder than I thought it would be actually
yeah
um harder in the sense that
I wasn't used to the pace
it's
mhm
you know the pace is totally different
mhm
um
And
I didn't really want to see anybody for a while
And I d- , and I didn't , which was fine
And I really missed people
um from Poland because it was all my support system
Coming here w- the only person that really knew and understood my circumstances was Tom
mhm
And so that was really tough because that was a_lot_of pressure on both of us coming coming with him again and all of that
mhm
um readjusting as far as Americanisms
mhm
uh Blimpie's scared me
Blimpie's is the sandwich place
I know
I know oh that's pretty funny
We went in there and it was so yellow
It was just so yellow and they wanted to help so bad
ah
And it was
ah
I just went back and I decided people are a bit too cheery in the U S
oh yeah
oh yeah
And see that wanting to help you so bad just freaked me out
ohmygod
like , I , I just like ran into stores and ran out because
uhhuh
I'd go on the weekdays when nobody you know because I'm
Right
you know I had time off and
uhhuh
I'd walk in there and like five people would say hello to me
I'd be just like leave me alone
i- , it's just
ohmygod
It's just very hard
I talked to Kristen though when I was home
yea
yeah
She seems to be doing well
She's working
which is good and she's got her she's healthy again
That's good
hm yeah
I'd like to be healthy again
yeah
I hope
hey
you know I was going to tell you this thing that I got Tom found this for me about this freebie experiment thing where you can do this and you can talk
uhhuh
yeah
And it was funny because he handed it to me and I was really confused and I said well ,
well is this somebody that contacted you on your email or wha
He goes no I told you about this last week blah , blah , blah
I'm looking at it because it had this guy and it
and his name wa- , his name is Mark Zalin- , Ya- , no , Yalinsky
And it said , and it was
and it was his email thing and it said U N I Lodz Poland
You told me
And I'm like
And it was a Playboy joke on this thing
It was done as an example of what we do
And it was from Lodz
And I'm like did somebody try to get a hold of you and he goes no
I go well there's this thing
I said look at this and it sa- , and it you know is all in code
uhhuh
And he goes ooh weird
He goes I didn't do that
That's really funny
yeah
Small world hu
You're
yeah
And now are you not smokin
No
I am smoking
yeah
Well I did a few when I've been back too
yeah
I've been smoking big time
It's been a rough couple months
yea
Well yeah it's been really busy
The kid sister thin
hu
The kid sister thin
Well no
Not really that but it's been really busy as far as work is concerned
Sure
yeah
You kno
Now things are just like kind of mellow and I'm just n- you know wrapping things up so it's not that bad
Sure
mhm
But it was kind of hellish for a bit
yeah
oh I'm sure
I still , all I want to do is sleep now
I've been trying to nap for the longest time today
Every time I lay down a phone rings and like random people call me
You're not that random but it's kind of random receiving a phone call from you
I mean you're not a random person but
Well thankyou
I appreciate being considered non , er non random
No
You're pretty organized and orderly
thankyou
you're random
No problem
Jody's going to be shocked that I heard from you
She wha
She's going to be happy that I heard
oh yeah
Did you get her postcar
I haven't heard
hm from he
yeah
No huh I haven't heard from her at all
She sent you a postcard
In fact we both sent you postcards

Well a friend of mine from Florida sent that to me
eh yeah
She's from Gainesville
Gainesville Florida
mhm
yeah
And
yeah so I I would like to think that it goes to a good because sending it back to me would probably just be ludicrous so you know why don't you just
So I can keep it
I'm opening it up right now as you speak so I can put a world peace stamp on it
uhhuh
All right
All right
You know wha
I've been saying all right all the time now
I went to this conference in the U S and they're like w- w- where did you get that I'm like
Great
I'm like that's a really long story
See there was this volunteer and she used to know this old man because she used to work and this man would just sit there and say all right
I have another one though too and Tom was really getting sick of it
What was i
I'll have to think of it
It's an- , it's another one of those all right
yeah
because he g- , he says what does that mean when I say it now
It's like
uh I , I need to know more information
Just hearing all right isn't enough oka
aw all right
It's like catchy man
It is
And you know
I can't stop myself from saying it yet
yeah
So but anyway I want to come visit you
Whe

mhm
That kind of thing
Well Jody might have a job offer in Budapest
oh that's right
She was looking at that
Isn't that craz
That's wild
yeah
I mean if i- , if it's June then that , that would be fine
But then you might come back to the states or something

Anyway
So how's the weathe
You know it's really nice
mhm
It's not as , h- how's the weather over ther
How come people are dying in Chicago , hu
It's because of bad administrative things and people don't have any air and ec- electricity and they're dying of the heat
Isn't that
We had a heat wave here for about a week and a half that was , in Nebraska we had one day a hundred and fifteen degrees
You're joking
No
I'm not
Isn't it cra- I thought like you know s- people were saying oh my God all these people are dying in in Chicago
I'm like oh where did you hear this , you kno
yeah
What was it two hundred and something
Well it's up to four hundred and sixty or something
yeah
Last time I heard , yeah
okay
yeah because last time I heard it was two hundred and sixty two or something like that and I was like wow
But that's still , that's a_lot
oh yeah
For something like that , there's no reason
yeah tha-
um It looks like Tejas is completely in the central time zone except for El Paso which you don't need
no okay because I

Because I'm trying to decide whether I should wake up one of my new volunteers

Party calls
total phone
You have total phone
I have
Great
What should we talk abou
Well I don't know
Tell me what's going on in America
I haven't seen the news in ages
Reall
You did d-
In the American news I mean I know what's going on in Russia but
yeah
Well let's see
What's going o
uh
You want me to just give you some headline
yeah
Give me some headlines
What's Clinton up t
up-
yeah
I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh his statement concerning affirmative action
uhhuh
And , and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of
you know of making al- allowances strictly based on race
but at the same time the analysis in the news
shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that
Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems
and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action
is necessary to move you know black Americans
forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been denied
So he's trying to , k- kind of walking a tight rope
You know what I'm sayin
Right
In other words l-
He's trying to please everybody
yeah
Let's see if we can make everybody happy
I think that he's
Then he just ends up making nobody happy
I think you're right Because you know affirmative action is really under attack in the United States on ,
from many different quarters right now
And , and it's a big ,
it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender , I mean not a gender a race
uh color blind we're supposed to be race color blind and yet it's like contractors
that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than
the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever
And it's really you know
Right
And then , then so they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and all of this so it's
Wow
Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in Georgia
violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race
There was you know a new
What did they do i- They were doing it because they were trying to make it more e- like they were trying to make it less segregate
They were trying to make the district majority black Americans so therefore they drew it all the way across the state
You see what I'm sayin
oh right
uhhuh
a , a very narrow district and it created a majority black district which then elected
a , a black representative and then it was challenged because it said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to ensure that it was
majority black and that's not
right
you know
Hell
I'm here
okay Anyway
I'm mulling all this over
yeah
I mean it's , it
So it's interesting because today we had a discussion with students about
because we're doing a pre departure orientation so we were , we had our hot topics
discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about like political correctness
and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment , feminism and
just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia
So that was one of the things kind of like that
But I have I'm not really up on what the attitude is in America because I haven't been there in so long
Well there's a_lot_of frustration I think over the fact that there're , there're a number of evidences that the affirmative action
program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people are saying wait a minute
Why don't we just give everybody
uh an e- try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race
go at it from the standpoint of , of trying to remedy it through the courts
rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what
Right
And as a result some m- some people are getting contracts just because
of the color of their skin and you know what I'm saying it's , it's , it's still
When they might not even be the most qualified
e- either them they're , they're not even , they're not the low bid
you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality spec- specification
Right
And but now you've , there have been several cases where clearly you know it was ,
they didn't get it because they just didn't weren't the right color skin
So now is that
Right
is that really remedying the situation or is it's creating a_lot_of uh of resentmen
And
Right
it's kind of too bad
How long
God what a mess
oh it's a mess
It really is
W- how long have you been there by the wa
Over her
um it'll be three years in November
Wow
So you really are out of touch aren't yo
Well I like to think I'm not totally out of touch
Well y- I know what it's like
I was never very in touch even when I was still America so
oh okay
You're that type
I got you
I was always in my , in my own world anyway so
Well I know what it's like because I've went , having lived over in Korea for almost three years it's
you know when you come back all of a sudden the you know the society has changed a little bit you know
uhhuh
New terminology
New buzzwords
And all that stuff
Right
Of course when you get to be over forty like me um , you can miss that stuff just being an American anyway
It all passes
I don't know
I always think when you get older you're more informed
When I was in college I didn't know what was going on
I was too busy
yeah
I'm thinking of you know like lingo that the young people come up with you know
Younger people
yeah I think I'm more informed now than I was in college
I was sort of out of it in college
But by the way u- d- did I tell you that I have a new jo
Well in your email you said that you're going to start your new job somewhere
You didn't say what your new job was
oh okay
I'm resigned here last week effective August tenth and I'll be taking the job of the director of English language
the English language program of a private university in Atlanta
a larger university
uhhuh
So it's kind_of a step up for me
It's c- it's called Mercer University
oh well you'll have to send us material from there
hey
Now we're talking
Do you do you /
to our advisor
you send people into E S L program
Well we get requests about it
I don't know how many people actually go because a_lot_of them you know don't have a_lot_of money but we get
students every year that ask about it that say they have money
Well you can be
They usually don't come though and tell us whether or not they go
yeah
Well you can be sure that we will send you information because
you know I've got to go down there and we're trying to r- to improve the program we're adding
they're adding thousands of dollars of state of the art language e-
you know equipment lab equipment and all of that and they're restructuring everything so
that's what I'm supposed to do next
Do they have any scholarships for foreign student
I , I'm , I've never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally but I think
We never did either but I keep thinking I'm going to find one of these days
yeah
I know
I'm sure that they pro- You know I e- the question of whether they have scholarships for international students
for the regular program is a good one and I'd like to find out
I'd like to think that they do
and , and I think
uhhuh
they might but I don't know yet
Right
it's not going to be my particular area of expertise you know i-
Right
that that's going to be regular program but still I would like to know
so I can tell people like you
So were you looking for a new job or did they just like come to yo
Well I was looking for a new job and I've been looking for about a year and a half
uh
and when I went to Nasa in New Orleans you know the one that you missed
I know the one , the great one that was so much fun
oh it was a blast but I'm not sure it was more fun than Miami I mean you know But it
it was fun though
You would have enjoyed it and as I said to you in the email the uh
the Russians and the Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious
I mean we had a ,
we had a nice little visit
We really did it's too bad I didn't
oh I can't believe they were calling her Lovie
We were in stitches to hear that she was calling herself Lovie
oh reall
You didn't know tha
Well because you wouldn't say that
Because in Russian it's just you know Lyubov but it's just a Russian name
I mean you wouldn't
think of translating it into English but the thought of people calling her Lovie in America is so funny
Well that's the , that's what she said
I mean I didn't know any
Well then I mean it's so her like it's just so her to do that that I just I just think it's hysterical
Is i
yeah
You should have seen them dancing around with the crowd out there when they had this
uh Carribean band or something running through the streets of New Orleans
It was kind of interesting
uhhuh
But
yeah
And we went , we went on a shrimp boat tour also
It was kind of fun
um
you know you got to sort of do that kind of weird stuff um I interviewed for this job at the , at Nasa
So that's kind of how it got to where it was
you know that was a major
major sta- sta- uh- s- major point to reach is do that interview and that was a good interview so
Right
yeah I kind of I knew they were trying to expand their program and I said well if you're going to do that
call me because I would be interested in an opportunity and so I've taken it you know
Well that's great
yeah
I'm excited about it
It's g-
Well what city were , what city were you i
Were you far from Atlant
No
Actually Branow is located north of Atlanta about fifty miles north up the freeway
which around here is you know not even considered to be that far
uhhuh
But , but this
And I don't even live in Gainesville which is the city where this universi- where Branow is
I commute about thirty three miles from the southwest
It's a forty five minute ride
And I'll be commuting
So so you'll be closer now
Well actually I may be two or three miles closer
I'm going to be commuting down into Atlanta
see I live north of Atlanta
you can do
and
how do you know you're going to get this money
well
how legitimate is this
well people are getting checks
who is
mark is , people above him they're
yeah , but mark's selling to you , of course he's going to tell you he's getting them
well , I don't know , I mean somebody must be seeing them
there are a lot of scams out there too
well I know , but people , okay people are buying in and
if the people above them were not getting their checks , they wouldn't do it
how do you know
how do I know
how do you know they're getting their checks
well why would they , why would they
why would they do it
because you make the checks out to the company , you don't make the checks out to them
what check
when you go in , you make your money order out , you send it to the company
right
you don't send it to the people above you
so why would the people above you be doing it if they they weren't getting
right
how do you know they're doing it
well because , they're spending time showing us
and having seminars , why would they even
just mark you said is doing the seminars
yeah , mark is , and
why would he even do the seminars if he weren't getting his checks that he's supposed to
because he's getting the money
no you don't send them to him , you
oh well it's a scam , he gets it back
well I don't think so
he he does another one too , he does
two different ones and he's focusing on this one now
all right
I mean you send it to some other state it's out in
it's Kansas or something , I don't know
I forget where it is , Oklahoma , I forget
but it's
it's a different state you know
and it makes sense you know , if you figure out how much money
if you figure out how much money ,
, what do you call it
I mean dick already got his free cards , he's been using his free calling card
mhm
and , if you figure out how much money the company has by when you put in the money ,
and you know , like you three thousand in each leg ,
it really only costs for long distance like about I don't know , if it's five cents a minute
and you get three six thousand dollars and you've only made twelve hundred of it
you know , so they make enough money
to pay you , they're glad to do that
right
yeah
so
that
I mean , it's it's a good deal for everybody
I mean four , five cents a minute
nine hundred , of of say , five cents a minute times three hundred thirty minutes
is what
sixteen dollars , seventeen dollars
at minimum , that's that's trivial
yeah
I guess , is that seventeen dollars
that's nothing
and then you got the
who says it's five cents a minute
yeah , is that seventeen dollars
yeah , but who says it's five cents a minute
excuse me
I don't know , it must cost them like so little , because it only costs sprint , if it only costs the customer ten cents a minute on sprint
so they must
, it must cost them only like five cents a minute
dick said it costs anywhere from four and a half to six cents a minute for them
I don't know where he got that number
but , this guy mark , he put his
mark put his , you know , his daughter under him , and then his
girlfriend's under him , on another one and
you know he's got all these people that he knows so that they can make money , but I don't know , you know
mhm
I'm I'm already getting a few people to go to the meeting , so
so that's good
yeah , and , let's see that guy I talked to yesterday , Michael
he's real religious , but he's going to
he he said he'll go
he has to get some friends to go too so
you know , it seems like it's a it's a great great deal it's like
it's like Mary Kay , how Mary Kay works or anything else , so why wouldn't it be legal
I didn't say it wasn't legal , I just I just want to make sure that it's legitimate , that's all
well , it's only been around for not even three months and there are seventeen hundred people in it already
well I would , I would want to know how they
how they do the calls because
what calls
I don't think MCL and sprint and and A_T_And_T are paying them
because they're using their networks you know
uhhuh
how are they getting how's the call being completed and how are they getting their money
and I said , well , you know , that far away from home any familiar face is a comfort even if it is just mike price's
yeah
yeah
anyway , ,
well it was fun
the food was great
it was catered
it was just wonderful
wow
and I won't tell to everything because it's all in your letter
okay yeah , I notice that every time I get a letter it's well we've covered all this
and , ,
but it's still good to get the letters
yeah you can reread them
reread them , yeah , , and I have
reread them Larry
and get my pictures
yeah
oh yeah , see they can't say r over here
some of these hotels , a lot of the hotels when you get
in the elevator and you want to go downstairs you have to press lobby
lobby
lobby
lobby
it's spelled r o b b y
mhm
yep
well when I called the first time to get your room number and
, I
I said , he said who do you want to talk to
I said , Mcgwire
he said what's the name
I said Mcgwire
and he said mister Larry
and I said yep
rat's rim
yeah well they have a problem with that so
it's deep
yep let's see
I'm just going to work and back and forth
I'm filling out applications for jobs and trying to get them sent in
I've got to finish them up monday
yeah well you had you've had an interview at out at valley already
yeah it it was fine
they'll call me if they have any night classes available but right now they don't , so
mhm
and they don't they they're probably not going to get any
so I just have to wait and see
Northridge I don't know anything about either but it's all in the letter
that's in the letter
mhm
let's see I talked to ken and Vicki yesterday ken I and I think ken might have gone to Arizona today to work
he got laid off when they stopped
well you were here when they had the big sink holes in Hollywood
no
due to the Metrorail
well they've had those off and on well , not big ones , but
well , there was this one that was about you know five blocks long it was just
oh really
well not five blocks , but it was you know a good
good size hole
oh it they closed Hollywood boulevard for a long time it was about
sixty feet by a hundred feet or something it was big
and so they shut down Metrorail because you know it's all because of that they're not doing things the way they're supposed to and consequently
the boulevard's caving in
and ken was working that you know so
he he was laid off and he just
they said the other night that he thought he would go to Japan , because he could get the Japan go to Arizona because he could
you know sign up and start working monday
only the pay is not as good as here so he has to work overtime and it's a sixty hour week and , therefore , he can't come home on weekends , so
now I think he I he was doing the yard this morning I said well maybe he's not going if he's into yard work
and then later I saw him packing up the truck
and then I missed when he left I didn't see you know Vicki say goodbye or anything so
he may be off to
to Arizona for god knows how long
we have new neighbors they moved in
well , who are they what are they
they're some kind of mexicans with three kids
oh boy
and a dog
oh boy
but the dog seems fairly cool he hasn't barked too much
is he a big dog small dog
fairly big he looks sort of like a
about bub's size but poodleish but doesn't weigh as much as bub
and Jojo had one of his parties again last night boy they were out there until all hours
well they do that , so
I know that's fine I saw it I looked over I said gee , I wonder if he's got the new people over there already , you know
had is joey still going the lawn
yup
I told you I've sent you some money and then I told you to also pay him because I think he's going on vacation
he went on vacation the second week and I I took after he'd the second week after he'd done the grass two times I went over to
you know give him twenty bucks because I thought I knew he was going on vacation
mhm
and it was Dennis was there and I said well , I know joey's going on vacation so I wanted to give him some money so he'd have it
and Dennis said he's already gone and Vivian said Dennis mowed the lawn today and I said well
you make sure joey gets this money
anyway , he's been doing a good job he forgot one day and
he came over later that night and he was just apologizing all over the place and I said it's no big deal , joey , just do it tomorrow
you know
yeah
no I'm sorry I'm sorry I just feel terrible I said don't worry about it it's no problem
I told him yesterday you might hire him fulltime because you don't like to do the grass
well I I might , depending on how long this money holds out
well we're going to have to buy a new car , dear you know that
yeah , I know that
my transmission's going
you're kidding
I'm sure it is
it's having trouble in reverse
wow
so , I'm keeping an eye on it , but
we just have to do it that's what we'll do when you first get home we'll buy the new car
yeah
maybe have to do that right away
we really do we shouldn't try to get any more miles out of any of these because they're going to get stuck somewhere
oh no I don't I don't really want to I just
want to get out there on that first week and start doing it you know
So tell me a little bit about the day she was born
When did you first see he
um what happened is we went to the hospital , she was induced
mhm
So we get a phone call and th- , she was supposed to
Right finally
um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um , it's my thinking that this will be distributed publicly
Right
at six thirty in the morning but she called and they didn't have any beds
oh no
So she called us and told us that , but then they did get a bed and she went in at eight
mhm
Or seven thirty or , I guess she went in at seven thirty and they started her at eight or so so we hopped in the car and drove down to be there
mhm
mm mhm
for the day
mhm
And um ,
we hung out all day
We had we had some difficult times with the lawyer down there
He was supposed to show up
mm
mhm
and we waited all day and he never bloody showed up
oh no
And um , he and also she was expecting him too
mhm
You know and so that was frustrating
yeah
But anyway we waited all day and
But then five twenty five Mae was born
Right
And the birth mother's mother was with her through the whole thing and she was fantastic
She was just great
She was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just a wonderful
uhhuh
mhm
Woman
person and
She was great
She came out , you know , a couple times during the day she came out and gave us little progress reports of how things were going and actually it was very funny
uhhuh
because the first time she out , I mean here we're out there sort of ringing our hands and
uhhuh
sweating it out and wondering how everybody is going and everything and she came out and could I go downstairs because um , her daughter wanted playing cards
uhhuh
So I guess she was bored
uhhuh
You know passing the time
So I went downstairs to get playing cards with her and
uhhuh
and then later on she came out and she wanted some chewing gum
uhhuh
um , I guess your mouth gets dry and you just want something
yeah
I'm sure
So , you know , it was , it was kind of funny these very
Reassuring in a way I would think
y- , yeah , but these very um ,
yeah
you know they're such sort of specific little things
yeah
And um ,
then but they kind of held her back
I think the baby would've born , been born sooner but the doctor didn't get there till around three
So
so I thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it
No they can hold you back
hm
a little bit , you_know
hm
Once , depends how much stuff they give you
How much stuff they give you
yeah
Stuff
But anyway I think they were holding her back a little bit because they wanted the doctor there
mhm
uhhuh
um , and the doctor showed up around three and Mae was born at five twenty five
mhm
Eight pounds eight ounces
mhm
And screaming
mhm
Really screaming and I was a little scared
I thought ohmygod what have we wrought
You could here her out through the doors of the hall , you know
uhhuh
And there were a_lot_of babies being born
You didn't hear them all
uhhuh
And I , and um , what happened h- , I guess um , that's right
Her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born
uhhuh
And then she said that's her
You can hear her
And um , said it was a beautiful birth
I mean two pushes and she was out which is really great so she's very unsquashed and unbattered looking for a new baby
uhhuh mhm
Right
Usually they look a bit bashed up
yeah
A bit worn
But she's got a nice shaped head and , you know she doesn't look like she was um , you know she's not a cone head
mhm
But did you get to see her in a few hours or
a-
Well what happened no right away there , there was a very nice
delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the day named Tina
mhm
mhm
mhm
And what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to the nursery
mhm
Normally they go directly and Tina very , very sweetly zipped past the door to the out , outer part of the nursery where we were waiting
mhm
mhm outside
mhm
and let us hold her
mhm
So she was just minutes old then
Wow
So we held her for just a couple minutes and
uhhuh
it was really funny because you could hear her coming up the hall screaming
uhhuh
loudly
uhhuh
uhhuh
She handed her to me screaming loudly and I said to Tina and also to the ,
uhhuh
the birth mother's mother there , you know oh Robert has the magic touch
I handed her to Robert
Instant silence
uhhuh
uhhuh
Instant
She just stopped screaming immediately
uhhuh
uhhuh
So he held her for a little while
And then the nurse was afraid to take her back
Said oh she's going to scream again
uh-
uhhuh
And she did
uhhuh
And off they went to the nursery and then you watched through the glass
That must have been very reassuring for Robert
It was very nice wasn't it
It was very wonderful for Robert and for me too just to see , I knew it would work too
Very nice
yeah
uhhuh
uhhuh
yeah
I don't know what it is
He has some , you have a theory
Body warmth or something but anyway
yeah
I think it's partly it but there're certain kind of men who , I think it's men who have like these big
I have this theory that it's men who are very broad right under the elbow you_know like ,
Wait a minute
Broad under the elbow
You mean in the ches
like
No
From the elbow down towards the wrist
oh
Who have like these big broad forearms
I think babies like that
You think it gives , it gives security
I suppose
Do you remember Otto who moved my filing cabinet that time in Philadelphia he's another on
Yes
uhhuh
uhhuh
yeah
He's big
He's sort of solid to me
who
He's sort of very solid and they just love it
But Robert's not big like that
No , but he , but Robert is big below the elbows I'll bet if you check
I'll have to check out below Robert's elbows
At any rate ,
So that was nice and then we watched through the nursery while they do ,
if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you'll survive anything after
It's the most sort of appalling introduction to life
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
But I was kind of scared at that point because we're looking in and there're all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there limp
uhhuh
and there's Mae and she's big compared to the rest and she was bright red and she is screaming and she screamed and she screamed and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse
yeah
And she was healthy I guess
uhhuh
And she just screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and I thought ohmygod what have we wrought here
Did they tell you her apgar or whatever they call tha
How
They didn't tell us anything
In fact , at the hospital they weren't
the , there were someth- , the individual people we had contact with were , were decent to us and friendly
Were nice
but the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us and they wouldn't , like we had been told , we they have a room called the bonding room
yeah
uhhuh
uhhuh
and the whole purpose of the room is to let people be in it with the baby , who /
uhhuh
are going to be with the baby
Right
And they wouldn't let us in there so ,
mm
d- , it was really quite awful
They wouldn't let us , they didn't , they they gave us but they didn't tell us beans
yeah
I mean they really didn't talk to us
They didn't offer us that parenting class that they offer to most people
mhm
We would have had to come back the next day to the hospital which of course we weren't going to do
hm
mhm
um , you know they really weren't very nice and
yeah
I guess they have , their rules are just very rigid
mm
And the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have arranged for um
Right
an additional bracelet
mhm
In other words , what happens is they put one on the wrist of the baby , one on the ankle , one on the birth mother
and then she has a , what you call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff and of course she had given it to her mother ,
hm
mhm
hm
I see
I see
which makes perfect sense
mhm
Well , the only way , they couldn't get their minds around the notion of a fifth bracelet for us
Right
So the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mothers away ,
Right
which we wouldn't ask and which she wouldn't do
Right
Right
And
the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time
and there was supposed to be I D there at the hospital for us and it was all set and of course he hadn't done anything
I see
He hadn't done that , hm
No
He hadn't done anything
He's been just hopeless
hm
I mean I think legally he's not hopeless
I think he's done all the necessary legal things but
yeah
you know in terms of the things ,
He's an S O B forgive me tape whoever you are but he was a fucker
yeah
No
th-
And
laugh
I'm sorry but he was
I think they said published actually
oh well they can edit that word I guess Anyway it's English so
yeah
It's American English
um
You know he , he said things to me like well you'll have her for the rest of your life , you know
yeah
Don't worry about it , which is really an arrogant attitude to take , you know
yeah
yeah
Man
yeah
He was really , he was a real arrogant S O B , so
How old was h
I don't know we never met him
He never showed up
oh
W- , he ended up in the end , his par- , he sent his partner to actually sign the papers who's not even an adoption attorney
mhm
He does litigation
Doesn't know what he's doing but I hope he did what his partner told him to do
mhm
mm
mhm
But he at least was a sensitive human being
mhm
And um , you know so that was nice
He had some sensitivity
We're going to get cut off soon
oh no
And I want to , I hope you
Tell me something then
I'll shut up
You can tell me something
Wha
okay
No
I'm worrying ab- , I'm not worrying I'm feeling like ohmygosh should all of this be in the public record or something
oh yes
Well they just beeped
I think that might mean we have to hang up
okay
We have a minute
um
I want to tell you I saw four parakeets fly across the street in Barcelona
oh neat
Is it thirty minute
It was beautiful
Is it
It's going to be thirty minutes in about five minutes I think
oh okay because there's a beep coming on my end
yeah
You don't hear i
No
okay
Well ignore it so we'll let them go on
Well
Well anyway
oh so that sounds very nice
They were loose or in a
Well I they were loose they were I said the Sheila I think I hear a parakeet
uhhuh
And you could tell he thought that it was nonsense that it was a
uhhuh
crow and then I saw it but the sun was against my eyes
oh how neat
so I couldn't tell and then it flew and when it flew three more of them flew out of the same tree
oh how neat
There was a street
They were beautiful
there was a street I walked down in Barcelona big wide
with all the bird sellers
Yes
They were closed up that day but I'm sure that what these were is
Well it was g- it was a wonderful place I mean I guess you have to sort of discount that they're in cages but
Escapees yeah
yeah It's it's part of
it was beautiful
yeah
I mean it was just so beautiful with all these amazing
yeah
birds and colors
And also in parts of Spain , I don't know if they have this in parts of France , but
Probably not
I saw parts of Spain where they had birds on the shutters and they put them out during the day
It's very popular in Spain but it's not so popular here in France
yeah
It was a nice thing
yeah
um
I've seen very little of it
yeah
y-
I had friends in Madrid whose father bred birds actually
oh reall
In their apartment
yeah
It's quite a big hobby
Parakeets o
No little tiny birds
I don't know what they were
Little
Finches maybe
yeah
Song birds of some kind
uhhuh
oh neat
And he was good at breeding them
uhhuh
so
oh well that's good
So but when you went up to Connecticut , all was wel
Or was that another adventur
up to Connecticu
Did I go to
Then you had to go up and get Jack and everything after
oh yeah it's it's New_York still but
oh
um yeah we got up
We got Jack
We went to the lawyer our lawyer who's been
mhm
Absolutely fantastic start to finish
I think she's great
mhm
mhm
um and then came home and that's when yeah then Robert's mom crashed the car
oh I see it was after that that she did that
So
yeah actually we had to do that at like eight o'clock the next morning because Martha was leaving by nine
So mom and dad were down there for how lon
They came Saturday and stayed Saturday night and Sunday and left Monday
uhhuh
This past Monday like
I'm doing good I was going to Susan's back and forth and my sister's back and forth so
yeah
Susan's away this week so I might I'm going to my sister's tomorrow she needs a babysitter on Thursday
yeah
so I'm going tomorrow but I I feel like I'm
I thought she was going away for vacation this week
she's away now
oh she's away now
but she's coming back tonight
yeah
yeah so I feel like this always happens when I get towards the end and I have this list of things to get
you_know like George he has a little list and I have to bring for him and his wife and his kids and I have to bring for
oh for f- to bring back she gives you the list I wouldn't bring her back anything
yeah she gives me ohmygod she said did I tell you about thi- the episode before I left
yeah you told me
oh she's such a shit well I just can't you know you have to pretend sometimes I bought her just a cute little like
uh makeup type of case you know if you have to go away you put a little makeup and sanitary pad and then I said to myself ohmygod maybe she doesn't have her period anymore
oh
she's like almost fifty
this'll be a funny conversation to listen to
yes and a little perfume inside of it I can't go and give everyone stuff and not her you know I am not going to
break off my relationship with him because of her
so are you still doing shopping around everyday
I still have to get Menash his sneakers I didn't
get them yet and I've to get stuff at the Wiz for Menash for m- m- George
at the Wiz
yeah he wants some stuff for his video camera
oh
he gave me such a list and including sneakers for him and her I I can't bring the sneakers back
because I'm going I don't want to take an extra suitcase with me I got to pay ninety dollars for an extra suitcase
yeah
and George said no I want some back and I bought two extras and they just let me go
well I can't take that chance they might not let me what am I going to do
the baby is not allowed a suitcase right
no nothing not even a carry on
so I
what do you come with one suitcase
no I was an idiot I came with two
two yeah
but I came with a regular one and a regular one inside of a big one
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave the small one's here
and
and take my mother's big one so I have two big ones
that's a good idea
because they really see I'm doing a Michelle I'm getting smart
yeah
Michelle's very you know practical
um tho- the-
the other thing is instead of taking one of your mother's if she doesn't you know want to relinquish it or whatever
she doesn't care she'll get it back
you buy you go the supermarket and you get a Pampers
oh
carton
right
and you just load it up and then you just throw the carton away
yeah that's true no she doesn't care I'm leaving her mine
and she's giving me this one doesn't I don't doesn't matter for me
yeah I told Shera too I says if you need things why don't you start shopping around don't wait til the last minute
ohmygod no she can't because she's got kids and I'm going with the baby all the time and you've got to do things really fast
she schlepped today she says she was going out of her mind you know look
for stuff
well your mother wasn't with her she
my mother had like a luncheon today and she was meeting a friend so she's /
so she went with the three kids
no no Daniel was in a little day camp so she took
oh
Tamara and the baby
really they put them in a day camp
yeah they're both going to a little camp I mean they're bored every day just going to the beach you_know
that's good well good yeah sure that's fun
so Tamara goes three days a week
oh it's really hard like Susan was taking me and she's with her kids you just got to know what you're going for
and do it fast and I get crazy because I say oh look at the dahdahdah
and I start looking and I want to try on and I and and you know I start seeing things and
my father's good you_know he's taking me we went to Cross County shopping center in the morning uh
y- well don't they have ads there in the Sunday paper of stuff on sale
yeah Caldor's you're not even going to believe what I bought in I don't do you have Woolworth's
Woolworth's there's /
yeah
not too many left around here
we have two in in in in in we have a few around
and I always wanted this a jean jacket you know a real rugged you know a regular guy's jean jacket
yeah
and in Israel they're pretty expensive and I saw here they were like sixty eighty
we're in Woolworth's and they have these beautiful jean jackets for twenty dollars
so I bought one it's pretty funny getting clothes in Woolworth's because they're like you know five and dime stores
y- yeah
you know cheapie but it's they're they're it's it's beautiful it's made in Italy
it's really nice
good
and I want to go back there with my father because they have nice books and cardboard books with like cheap two for five you know mark down stuff English
ye-
books
oh sure
um
because this kid's learning English so quickly
the
did your brother bring
I can't stop
give you the money or he's going to pay you back when you go there
he said no he said let Mommy see it she'll lay it out and I'll give it back to her when she comes my mother's like yeah right my foot
oh Jesus
and and my father's like you mean your he didn't give you money he didn't give you money he's almost fifty years old you're still buying
my mother didn't want to say no she
when is your
says that he's going to like pay back some of the stuff
when is your mother going to come visit
well she wants to come in October
yeah
but if my father doesn't want to come or if he has weddings he's not going to leave he gets like a wedding or two he'll he won't go
yeah
and then my mother will not want to leave him which is the r- same reason she didn't want to go to
she didn't want she wouldn't leave him f- for a month or three weeks
but is he feeling okay
yeah he's feeling okay he had a little episode before you know but
so it might not even have been from that he felt dizziness
and maybe it was because of the was the heat or something
maybe the heat it's so God damn hot here you could plutz
felt a little funny he felt a little funny in the chest but that could be a reaction because of the heat
it was really it's it's very humid you know it's hot I mean Tiberius is very hot too
but it's dry and this is humid I don't know what's worse
humid
I think the humidity
it's very uncomfortable
it's not humid in Tiberius in the summer
it's dry no it's like Tel_Aviv is humid
yeah
there was another
did you hear
yes
uh I can't believe it
I was just going to say
terrible I just heard it yesterday Menash was in Tel_Aviv with the kids
he was for the day
he was but my mother called yeah for like two days my mother called
um
your mother in law
he called he called my mother no yesterday but it would ha- he called after this happened
and I wasn't here my mo- so I said what did well what did he say maybe I should call and she said well she he called after this
and sh- and he didn't say anything he just called today also
w- w- where was he with
he was
cousins
it well he was with those yeah he was sleeping at Rishon_Le_Zion but he was going he went to Superland
ye-
it's a big big amusement park I was
yeah
were there
and whatever just going around I don't know what to Gal got pierced ears she she told me
ohmygod you're kidding me
yeah I I called from Susan's because
because it's cheap from Friday night right so I was at Susan's house Friday night so I I I
called A T T I asked how much it would be and I gave her the money right there because you_know
yeah
can't ask her so just spoke like five or six minutes it was ten dollars something it was like the medium price
yeah
wasn't the cheapest it was the medium
yeah
so because I knew where they would be then I knew if I call at any other time like I I might get them I might not
but I know they're at his mother's at nine o'clock on Friday night
so Gal was so excited they sound so good ga- Gal is all excited she's
until she could get it out of her mouth she said I got my ears pierced , earrings
so I'm going to get them each a pair of earrings Talya wants too she just wasn't around when they did it to her
was Talya had her ears pierced too
n- no I'm saying she wants to she wasn't with them when they when she got it done I don't know I don't know why she was
oh oh yeah
w- Wucha took Gal
oh mygod and she wasn't afraid
she well she's really brave
0
she's yeah really brave
she's braver than Talya
oh yeah she yeah
so the the little one is really speaking English here
yes saying doggie ball bottle
well when you get back you have to like
I have to just continue but it's hard you
start getting into this you know into the
0
thing again it's not like Shera and Rick I wish it was you know two English speaking
yeah but you know what Menacher is speaking so much better now I can't get over him
when did you hear him
when we came in May
you were there really
you know my parents said oh he speaks English I says yeah he speaks English I says he doesn't really speak English
funny
but I could see that he must have been studying
well he didn't learn from me oh he wan- no he wants me he keeps threatening I'm going to take a
course in English because you're not teaching me how could I teach him
well speak to him in English
that's the thing but y- y-
it's easier said than done y- when you talk to someone that you're living with you know and you want to get
things done you know quickly and on the spot and you know
yeah that's true
you know what I mean
yeah
it's easy y- it's very easy to say but you can't imagine until but
I mean I
oh I know people will yell at me why Claudio doesn't speak to me in Spanish
right
you know so
God willing you have
like
kids and I hope you would
yeah he'll speak to them in Spanish
yeah so what's happening in that department when's the next thing
well I got to go Friday
did you get your period
for an ultrasound yeah I did
after we spoke aw did you cry
no
no good
no because
okay
I was you know it was late
uhhuh
it was thirty two days but
oh
um I thought maybe there would be some slight ch- miracle that something may happen
yeah I hoped it will I'm telling you I just
two girls that I work with
went through these things and they have kids now you know
so I'm shooting up every night and
uhhuh shooting up your tushie
Friday Friday I got to go for the ultrasound
in your tushie
well in the morning and at night I give myself a shot in my /
mm oh my /
stomach
God ohmygod
and then at night Claudia gives the me a
what does this do for the eggs
well the shot that I take morning and night holds off the ovulation
yeah
and the shot at night promotes eggs egg gro- f- you know follicle growth whatever
uhhuh
so you got to do an ultrasound to what to see what
to see how they're progressing if there's eggs there if they're big enough
wait a second this is being recorded Michelle
I don't care they don't know me
oh okay
do I know you
do I know you
what else
I'll tell them a joke yet
this little boy
oh
says to his mother to his father daddy how does mummy get pregnant how does she have a baby
well the mummy makes the eggs and the daddy makes the sperm and we put them together and the mummy grows a a baby in her belly
yeah
so the little boy says to his father well how does the sperm get into her belly does do you put it in through her mouth
so the father says only when she wants jewelry
jewelry
you don't get it
um maybe I'm not sure say
oh Beth
oh shit what
only when she wanted jewelry like she'll give him a blow job only if you know she wants something
oh okay okay
oh oh Beth
only if she wants /
you need an interpreter
like diamonds and gold I guess I have to have some more experience
oh my
oh no
you are f- too much
okay okay yeah yeah no because they call those the family jewels
so I didn't know if
that had something to do with it or
no no
no I knew blow job I understood blow job
but I didn't know jewelry okay when she wants something when she wants a diamond ring or something okay
yeah right right
okay
okay
so what else how much more time do we have
anyway
how much more time I don't know they'll come on and give us the little ding ding
yeah
oh so I'm the one you called I'm so thrilled
yeah
I'm so honored
meanwhile I called you're just sitting down to dinner your mother will shoot me
and the same
he's he's not
eating at the table
because when he sits at the table he has to kind of lean forward /
yeah
to the plates
yeah
and I said that's a no no
mhm
and so and yet he said he can go out for dinner
you're not
yeah because you're not you're not supposed to have that at a ninety degree angle
what
you're not supposed to have it more than a ninety degree angle
oh
more than ninety degree
so I always had something you know a pillow under there or something
right right and you know people think we're nuts
you know people come to visit and I say you can sit here there and there but you can't sit in those two chairs because those are the chairs that Allie sit in
yeah
and they look at me like well what difference does it make
you know it makes a lot of difference /
oh
the chair he's in
sure yeah
and then I'll say to him put your leg down /
you know /
and they think what is she badgering him for
but he forgets and he pulls that leg up
and it is supposed to be extended /
yeah
a little bit you know
yeah
he's a wonderful patient though
yeah sure
you know and
he he
and it's very early yet Toni my god
well that's what I'm saying you know I
this is only a week
I said to Brent you know he was operated on friday and home monday and
yeah
he said I didn't realize that
he said that's a little soon I said you bet your bippie
and and it's not nice for you either /
no no I've never been so frightened
because
you know when he fell
yeah
oh
that did something to my confidence
I'm sure
you know I mean I'm pretty confident and I've been around sick /
people and you know my mother had her hip /
and you know I'm I
and certainly I work with the fragile /
mhm
in special Ed you know
and I've never
been so nervous as I was that night
well that's enough to scare the life out of you to /
uhhuh
bring him home and have him fall
right you know and then all I could think of is if he /
pops something it was my fault
yeah
you know
really wasn't my fault but that's how I felt
you know and then somebody else was saying well you need to laugh more and I thought , laugh more I'll smack you
yeah you know so when I'm not laughing or Allie's not laughing there's something wrong you know
yes because you do very well in that area too yeah
yeah yeah
and then somebody else said well you need to get out more Toni
and I thought why
I want to be with Allie
yeah sure
you know I have no desire I wouldn't care if I ever went out again you know
and she said oh you need to get out and you know be among people and everything and
that's because she needs that she could this person can never stay home five minutes
but I don't need that I can't tell you the last time I've been in a department store
and I'm sure he doesn't want to go out
oh no he was terrified at the doctor's today because
oh yeah
little kids were running around and the mothers weren't watching
is he using the walker or the crutches
he was using the walker and
then monday the nurse the therapist encouraged him to try the /
crutches
uhhuh
and so today he used the crutches going to the doctor's office /
because it was easier
the doctor's office no matter where you park /
you have a long walk
to the door /
because they have like a courtyard /
yeah
instead of having handicap /
parking
and the area that you have to walk on /
half of it is like fake stonework
oh boy yeah
they're crazy
this is for an orthopedic group
you know
they're nuts
yeah
and and then when we went to /
pull into the parking place some dude
in you know in the handicap parking place he had taken up two
places where the ramp was
a young kid
and I said to Allie boy I hope he gets in that car when I'm out here because I'm going to give him a piece of my mind
but I was parking the car when he got in and took off you know so I didn't get my opportunity
but anyway he used the crutches going and coming I had the walker with me but he
see I never use the I'd I never I would be afraid to use
yeah he he was quite comfortable with the crutches
I think they're newer
and but he can't use them for any length of time because he gets tired
yeah
and so let's see what else so
the swelling has now pretty well gone down but he said to wear the sock for another week /
during the day
he told me to get vitamin e and break it open and put it on the incision
that helps in the healing of the incision
mhm
and
you know and to put peroxide on the incision and that
and then , one question we didn't ask
pretty good
yeah
pretty good how about yo
Busy , busy , busy
yeah , sch-
I took some summer courses
I started in May
I took an English Lit for five weeks and then I took Psych and Soc which I'm finishing up next week
I can't wait
Is it Psych like
Psychology , Introduction Psychology
Introduction yeah I've taken that
and Socio-
Sociology is a_lot_of work
yeah , what kind of Sociolog
It's just general Sociology
okay
um
You have to record write up journal write ups and stuff like grab articles out of the paper /
about specific topics and I have to write a paper and hand it in by the end of next week
mhm
There's a_lot_of digging information that has to go with it
There's a_lot a work to it whereas Psych I just have to study the chapters and take my tests
yeah
And I've gotten A's on all my tests
Good
So , I've gotten A's for that
I know I hate I hate research
It's hard
It's very hard
And then you have t-
Well , it takes so much time
mhm
And I've been working up until like last week
I hurt my back picking up Shanley
So I mean I've worked the past two weeks
oh you're kidding
So I'm going back Monday though , thank goodness
Because I don't have any sick
Do you have to go through any physical therapy or anything like tha
yeah , I'm doing that now
yeah
yeah , I went last week and then I went I'm going three times this week
I see the doctor tomorrow
mhm
So hopefully I'll get a note saying go back to work on Monday because I've no time to use
You know for sick time and stuf
yeah , because you took time when you had your surgery on your knee too , righ
mhm
Exactly
I used a_lot_of it up at that time
mhm
So , I have none left whatsoever
I had to use up my last two vacation days because I had they make you do that now for some reason /
which is fairly new which really isn't fair but
What do you mean beca- it because you were out sick or
Well , I've been out all week and I said do I have any sick time she said I had seven hours and I said well just give me the seven hours of sick and that eight hours of holiday
So I have eight hours worth of pay that's it
uhhuh
I said don't use my vacation time
She told me she had to
oh
Now , I have like two days left
uhhuh
Like sixteen hours which was going to cover me for at least a couple days in August so I wouldn't like go without a check
yeah
but they told me they had to pay me that sixteen hours of vacation time /
huh
which is mandatory which I think stinks
yeah
You know ,
hm
but I just can't wait to get back to work and
Back to normal
yeah
and I like taking courses and I really like it but I don't like taking summer courses not like two at a time
yeah
It's so crammed in
mhm
for five weeks
yeah because we do t- and we do like two chapters we have to study for tomorrow and I only read one thoroughly and the other one I'm going to read and learn
so I've got to go to the library and ba- basically box myself in like in one of those little cubicles and just read it and and learn it that way
mhm
Because I can't really concentrate unless I'm totally away from things
yeah
Like I'm home and the T V is on in the other room I can hear it
Right
I need to be totally isolated and have just everything block everything out
mhm
That's the only way I can study
yeah
I mean I can't even study if I'm with Patrick
because I'll sit I'll read stuff
yeah
like I can read a book but I can't like study and because I don't I can't block everything out
yeah
so
So you guys are still seeing each othe
yeah , it's it's weird because couple days after I wrote you Mal was really bummed out
yeah
And we talked and stuff and I mean I told I miss him and me- I was crying on the phone
He was crying on the phone
mhm
Because I said are you going to miss m
He said well I miss you already and it was like you know why we doing this then
yeah
So I figured we'd /
take more time give him some more time and like evaluate in like six months like in October
mhm
So we've been seeing each other up until and you know we still have been seeing each other but I don't like go to family things of his
mhm
which is kind of weird and I'm like I wrote him a letter over this past week and told him /
how this is not enough you know I said it's you knew this was going to happen at some point you have to make a decision either you want us to be together or you don't
yeah
you know my feelings and /
that's just the way it has to be I said this isn't like it's a new relationship
We've known each other for ten years and we've gone through the good , bad , and the ugly
yeah
and we were still here because we love each other so that should mean something or that should show you /
you know that shou- that should be significant somehow
mhm
I think it is but we're going to talk about some stuff on Friday and then we're spending the day together Sunday
Is he working no
No , in fact he got laid off
Did you know tha
I think I think h-
I'm not sure if he got laid off and was laid off when grandma died
I think he was
yeah
I think he was
but h-
but he was going to I don't know he was going to do something
Was he going to go to
He had gotten some money for school
yeah
so he took English Comp which he got a an A minus in I believe because he really he's a really good writer
uhhuh
and he really writes from his soul and he's taking of all things Anatomy and Physiology which is the toughest thing he could take and
yeah I know I don't ever want to I don't ever want to take that
and he's having a hard time with it but he's busting his butt I mean he's he's done some work and has gotten some really good grades and some just mediocre grades
so he's take he wanted to prove to himself that he could do it so he took the hardest thing he had to take forever
Next time he'll just be doing the A and P of the alcohol abusive person
mhm
So , he told me today he just got his test back he thought he did really well but he got a sixty eight and he's so ticked because he made some careless errors he /
skipped one question and went on to the next but when he wrote th- the the letters in ,
he put it on that particular one and then when he answered the other questions the other three were just off because they weren't in the right spot
oh
mhm
At the last four which were right which he would have had credit for were wrong because he put them on the wrong space
Right
Right
and he was really ticked off at himself
Did , is that passin
yeah sixty eight is passing I mean a D is passing
yeah well see it there's different scales that people have
mhm
for grades
yeah
and sometimes tha- tha- you know like a I don't know I don't remember how it goes but
It's passing but for some particular programs you have to have at least a C or better
mhm
So I was lucky I got a B in English Lit but that was like the first time I wrote a paper in like eight years
Was that an interesting clas
I liked it yeah
I didn't like the poetry
mhm
and having to analyze poetry but I liked English Literature I liked analyzing the stories
yeah
I enjoyed that part and that part once I got the hang of it was okay
yeah
and my first paper I got a C on and I'd knew the story really well
It was intelligently written but I didn't like dig into it
mhm
and the second paper I got a B minus and then and I never really liked the author of that story either
I didn't really understand the story so well
yeah
Called The Misfit
I didn't like the author Flanner O'Connery
oh
I've heard of him /
but I've never read anything
um and th- the third one we did is Hamlet which I loved
I love Shakespeare
hm
So I had to write a paper on Hamlet
Shakespeare's hard to understand I think
It is
because you have to keep going down to the footnotes and like
learning what the words mean and stuff
mhm
but we also watched the film I got th- the tape the movie with Mel Gibson and
oh
I watched that
yeah
and I really enjoy that kind of thing
mhm
so I wrote a good paper I made up my my little poem at the end of it
and I got a B plus and I because I really I added more to it you know
yeah
It was really it was really well done I really and that was the easiest paper for me to write I don't know if it was because I had done two before that or if I just really enjoyed the material I was working with
yeah , that helps
but I got a really good grade on that and I got a B on the course but I worked really hard for it and it wasn't easy
yeah
You know and then for Psych and Soc I got three A's on my test for Psychology I'm taking one next tomorrow and then one on um next Wednesday that'll be my final grade
yeah
And then for my midterm on Soc Sociology I got an A
hm
and then I'll take my other final next week so it's a lot Sociology's been a_lot_of work
You going to take anymore classes after thi
yeah , I'd like to take Introduction to Art or or History
mhm
or take a philosophy and maybe I don't even know if I even want to tackle a Spanish yet
yeah
I have to have a language but I don't really know if I really want to do it now
I think I'm going to take it do you guys have tele course
Do you know what those ar
What are the
Tele courses
It's like you you get a video
mhm
and you just you know watch the video at home
mhm
and you do your own the reading and the the work and stuff at home and then you go in however so often they have a schedule set up to the school and take your test
oh reall
It's like in a testing s- center
uhhuh
Wow
And I'm I'm going to try that since I took you know a_lot_of French in High School
yeah
I thought maybe it won't be too hard /
huh
to do it that way I'm going to try and take it
that would be interesting
yeah ,
because we did a /
we'll see
study evaluation on us
We had to write down on Psychology and it turned out that I'm a I'm a what do you call i
something observer
reflective observer when I study
mhm
When I do things like kind of like like sit back and watch the stuff and I
yeah
I could be very quiet in the class
I don't really participate a_lot in the class
when I pay attention I'm always there
mhm
but I don't like say a_lot_of stuff
yeah
Not in the Psychology class I don't
I just don't feel comfortable with it like with the people that are in there
yeah
so I just I listen so I know everything I comp- I comprehend everything I know it but
Is there younger students in
or just are they mostly adults o
There's there's a mix
There some high sch- not high school kids like nineteen twenty year old
yeah
and there's some married women in there an older woman
mhm
and then younger kids
There's a couple black people in there
yeah , that sounds about
You know it's it's a good mix
like what it is here yeah
but it seems like this kid who I'm not saying oh I hope I'm not being prejudice but he's black and he's like always questioning the teachers and stuff and he thinks like
well if your father you know if that's if you were told that you were brought up in a house you do what he says you know that's
that's okay to learn that and stuff and that's okay to do to your kid and she's trying to teach him that it's not okay to do that
mhm
that's not how you build someone selfrespect and to do things like that and it's like a couple people like to argue with her and like
they think teachers are really ignorant and stupid you know
well she got to be the teacher she must have done something
but yeah
So but it's it's good I mean it's been interesting
They had a hypnotist come in the other day but I didn't want to do it just because I wasn't very I was skeptical of it and not really enthusiastic about it
yeah
I didn't feel comfortable like I wa- I was more interested in watching people around me
mhm
like see if they really kind of like really got into it and
I don't know if I would ever do it I
I'd be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized I don't know if I'd /
oh I would too
be afraid or
Corning Revere , County Seat , that's clothes
yeah
Eddie Bauer , of course I've
never that's the girls' place
yeah
No
And then that Etne Anye or
oh right
yeah they have that and
or a shoe place mm
Let's see here for house wear , Florsheim shoes , Geoffrey Beene
Perria and David , I don't know what that is , Jockey
Jones of New_York
let's see and then they've got a couple leather places
they never get into Girbaud places but they never do
Never get wha
That's the one Girbaud
oh
That's the brand of jeans that he likes
oh no they're that's not on here
I mean it never is
It's one of those things like whenever a s- store has a sale of
twenty percent off anything or something it's always excluded you know
oh jeez
know it's like rip-off
Luckily the ki- the girls have never bought that
It's a boy's thing I or man's thing girls don't wear them I don't
oh
oh
okay because I've never heard them talk about that
And they've got Legg's and Levi's
Music for a Song
Nordic Track
Osh Kosh Petite and Sophisticated , I thought mother might like that when she's here next year
yeah
and Reebok Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory
Daddy said something about I said well we can go to the zoo he said no no we don't want to go anywhere we just want to sit around and talk
oh
And I said you have to see our zoo it's really cool it's got the jungle and the penguins and the sharks and everything he said okay
oh yeah
yeah
She didn't want to just sit around and talk she's ready to go someplace so
yeah
Well they're I mean I I want to do some of that but you know you can only
yeah and I and I decided not You know , to wear them
and I said well you have to go to Mister C's the plastic grapes and Christmas lights and Daddy said well yeah we have to go there
I mean
Well
yeah
Well even at the beach you know who's the one who always wants to go to or
yeah yeah
that's right yeah of course I think he feels like he
you know
needs to entertain us down there so
entertain us
But daddy's a goer and
yeah he's a goer he gets tired of just /
He gets tired but he likes to go to I figure he loves that Nelson Art Gallery
sitting around yeah
yeah
So I figure we'll go down and I haven't been there for quite a while and they al- they change it a_lot you know
yeah they change the exhibits and stuff
Right so I thought we'd go down there and have lunch in that
um atrium type deal they have there and do that
yeah and I think the thing is he doesn't
want to go like for a whole day necessarily but if he just goes some place part of the day I think that
Right
yeah
Right
kind of yeah
yeah that's kind of what I figured we'd do
And then
I had a
letter from Mommy yesterday
oh what did she sa
She wrote some kind of
interesting stuff
oh reall
about Todd , just a little bit
yeah what
I don't know if she told you that or not about how they had an offer on their house and stuff
yeah she did tell me they had an offer because I called her to talk to her about the /
yeah
cost of the plane tickets
yeah
and
I said well what are they asking for the house
And she didn't know
She just knew that the offer was thirty thousand dollars below
But Todd told me they were asking two sixty
oh really
yeah
hm
And he or two fifty nine ni- I can't remember what he said but he said they had it like
at two sixty
and then agents said they should put it like
two fifty nine nine or something so that
yeah , yeah
because some people and I didn-
yeah that makes
you know and I thought they should probably put it at like two
be below two fifty would be a normal cutoff place for a_lot more people , you know
oh yeah
And
Well but the thing about that is some people look a little higher than that and then offer two fifty
Right , yeah
you know god that is so noisy I hate it when the girls do that when I'm on the phone
What is i
The ice maker
oh f-
And I mean it just sounds like an earthquake you can't hear a thing when that's on
yeah , yeah
um what did they pay for the hous
What did they pay , two
what two twenty five or something and then they put in the pool
yeah
And she said she said it was
twenty below their bottom line
So apparently they're willing to go down ten
mhm
But to me just sell the freaking thing
I mean get rid of it
I mean if they had an offer they should jump on it man
yeah
I mean well I mean well you look what happened to on his house and they can take that loss on their taxes
oh yeah
yeah
You know I mean you can recoup a little bit
It probably wouldn't even be a loss I don't know what the pool cost but it'd probably be about
well two thirty yeah it would be a loss
yeah they would take a loss on it but you c- like I said you can write that off too /
yeah
on your taxes and because when
But Susan's the one you'd think would be wanting to get rid of it because she's the one who's paying for nothing basically at least Todd gets to live there so
oh yeah
oh yeah
I know well I know when
You know
Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house
He had to sell it at a loss
And we've taken that loss on the tax return I think next year is the last year we get to take it and he said that'll really hurt us when we don't get to take that anymore
yeah
And I forget you can take so X number of dollars
a year
spread it out over yeah
yeah you can stretch it out and
that'll be gone but you know
yeah
that's kind_of a nice w- especially if he's going to be a single person
yeah and she said that he
you know
said neither one of them had filed for a divorce and that that wasn't an issue the main thing was selling the house first and then they could get the rest of it in order
hm
and he said something about
how weird
that Julie has really butched out I guess she's got her hair cut
oh really
like
short as a ma- or you know shorter than a_lot_of man's you know and
oh jeez
and mother she's so funny when she writes something about she thought Susan was a
man in the relationship and then she said I don't know much about this can both of them be men
oh jeez well Susan definitely wants to be a man there's no
yeah , yeah so e- but this other gal's got her hair butched that short and
no
doubt about that
god yeah sounds like she wants to be a man too
mhm
jeez
so like mother says who knows maybe they can both be men
I guess so
That is just so bizarre
yeah it really is
But like I said I think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them
yeah
because we wanted happiness for Todd but
oh yeah
oh yeah that was my very first thought and I thought oh don't be so mean , don't even say that you know
yeah yeah
But I I looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it took me a minute to decide /
which one was
which one was Todd you know it's like hm hm
yeah
yeah
well and I'll never forget that night when they were right before the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girlfriend
mhm
and how you know she thought you know this girlfriend at work said they would couldn't be friends anymore and she told her that was silly and I thought why is she telling me about a girlfriend
yeah
yeah
yeah I remember then
it's just the whole thing you know I mean yeah
all the little bells went off in my head but I just thought no no no no you know
yeah yeah
I know there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and
her last kid just graduated from high school and she was talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah blah and
mhm
yeah
and
I'd seen her a year or so ago at a restaurant with
a lady and
you know and they acted guilty when you saw them you know it was one of those things I mean it was a Saturday night you know bu-
but it was kind of like sh- and it was a small restaurant that a-
mhm
huh
yeah
yeah
the other people picked but it was like way out of the way and not a place I'd ever been before ever heard of and
Right
And there she was and so she kind of it was it was just a little different than it normally you know
uhhuh
And I thought that's kind of strange and then I thought they a they kind of looked like they were
you sitting pretty close and stuff and
yeah
so anyway then my secretary told me that day she said oh Lorena was in today did you know she bought a house I said well we
talk in the spring and she said some- she was going to and stuff and she said
mhm
well she bought it with another lady
mm
And I said
oh and I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird
and stuff and she said well I've always kind of wondered about her because she is a real man hater she just
uhhuh
I just figured that was because /
oh really
she went through a bad divorce and and he really did
yeah
he
ran around he had another woman and yeah it was kind_of a bad deal for her so
yeah
huh
But anyways you know it just all makes sense you know and like you said the little signals were kind of there but you just think oh that's you know
yeah
yeah
don't jump to conclusions you know just because a lady's out with another woman you know that doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything
and then I really thought even if they live together I suppose they don't /
mhm
necessarily have to have a sexual relationship
No they don't have to
I mean I've thought of doing that before and I I still think if
something happened to Ted you know later on and I had a woman friend that I enjoyed and stuff I wouldn't you know I'd
mhm
yeah
be opposed to
oh yeah
get a place together or something to share expenses and having a companion and stuff and it wouldn't mean we were sleeping together but
Sharing a place
Each to their own
Yes that's right
It's just too bad Todd had to be caught in something
yeah a
messed up with all that so
Yes
I guess he's still going to church every Sunday , mother said he'd stop by on his way to church or something and
yeah
So I don't know maybe he can /
yeah
find somebody else at church
If he'd get another church you know I think that would be better you know
oh yeah
And
and then
quit going over to see her parents and stuff I think that's just kind of prolonging the agony too so
oh it is
It is but I think you
but if you need that you do it until you don't need it
yeah
Right you have to let go gradually I think no
yeah
yeah yeah and when when
he'll know when that's not right for
anymore so
right
yeah it might
so
poor little brother but
mhm
He seems to be doing fine really I think so
yeah
yeah
But it's just kind of interesting and then she wrote some stuff about Mary Blakeman
oh reall
God wha
hang on a second I got to get this letter it's just right over here
okay
This is just for you
It'll just take a second
yeah alright
thought I had everything here ready for my call but I had my
oh
juice and my banana and everything let's see here so I forgot this letter what did she say she said
oh
I went out to see Mary last week they've moved her from the therapy department to a regular room and her roommate is a black woman
Mary was out at the nurses' station waiting for Bill and Leslie Ann to pick her up and take her home
They told me she's been doing it for a couple of days
She did know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait
Then she asked me to take her home and I told her I couldn't
Then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming
Finally I tried to explain they weren't coming and she asked who isn't coming
God
So
my heart heavy I told her I had to go and left
I had tried to get
her to go back to her room but she kept asking me why I said that was her room
So sad
I surely hope I never end up in that state
hm
mm
If I do don't ever come see me and break your heart Better to remember me as I was not in that condition
mm
So
trying to see if she said anything else about
Todd
um
oh yeah she said he was going up to Baltimore for a week so she was xxx-sitting yeah
yeah she was cat sitting yeah she told me that
yeah she said they have an offer house thirty thousand less
um , no , I talked to Dougo
oh , how's he doin
Well , I guess Well Do- , well the thing is , Dougo's kind_of annoying me a little bit
oh wh
Well , the first first of all , well I I I di- , h- , I think he sort of knew he did- , I didn't want him to be here
yeah
But still he oh I want some place to bring people
It's like how long are you going to be here
uhhuh
So I really uh ,
don't think that it's very appropriate or so forth
Like you're on vacation , I mean , what what's the point
yeah
And it's just sort of I'm just that , that kind_of annoys me it's kind_of a
Well you know why he wants to bring people there righ
What's tha
You know why he wants to bring people there righ
Wh
Well you know
His boyfriends and stuff
Yes , but I did- , e- , w- , I I'm sorry , I don't want another Lee Worthy , oka
yeah , well
And I don't , I I'm I'm , put it this way , I don't think it's beyond that , oka
huh
I don't think it's be- , well n- , n- , th- , I think Lee is actually a little bit cleaner than It's e- what I'm sort of kind of figuring out now after a while
uh-uh
And I just don't like it , you know what I mea
uhhuh
This is not a motel , oka
oh , I know
oka
And it just kind_of annoys me
yeah
uhhuh
It's like are you going to be showing u
I don't care
I'll show up whenever I please
So Anyway , and then Anyway , we were su- , e- , supposed to do something with Er- , I mentioned , well then why don't we get together with Eric or something Friday
uhhuh
You know , let's you know , go out to a movie and so forth
I wanted to see this mov- , Species movie which was pretty good
last night , yeah
yeah , but the thing is is that he never calls , never does anything
oka
And so all I get now is I get some message , well I just , wh- , d- , I want to get a hold of a key , when can I get it He wants me to straighten up or something
It's like I'm not going to straighten up so this can be like your little nest
I'm sorry
And it just , it just sort of annoys me
yeah
You know if you want to do s- do any of that other stuff , just go somewhere else
yeah
I don't know sweetie , I just
No , I just think it's bullshit , I mean that's , I'm sorry , but it's , I have to it's
I know , I just think you're getting a little worked up about th-
No
I I'm sorry , I don't got time for this crap , oka
That's about it , oka
y-
I g- I have to feed some animals now , and worry about that now
And then this other /
oh are you staying over ther
rubbish
It's just What's tha
Are you staying over ther
uh , I'm thinking about it
yeah
yeah , well then
why not , you know
I just wish you would mention to me before you offer
I did
Well I was kind of saying , I was kind of hesitant
yeah I e- w- I don't know if you asked me
You mentioned it , and then it came up to discussion after you'd mentioned it to Dougo
But beforehand , I'd kind of been kind of like negative on it
So
I don't know , I just , I guess I never really thought that it would be that big a deal , you know
yeah , well Well
I mean , I , I d- , I just think that it's largely because you're in a really high stress situation now
I'm in a situation where I need full control of my environment
I know ex- , I know that
yeah , so , so
I was just
And so I think that's why you're
And then no but anyway he doesn't call , and I just all he d- , i- , I mean Friday , and all he did was give this message today , I want a key
I mean talk about a little bit th- rude , I'm sorry
Well
That's really rude , if you ask me
It's just like , w- , I I just want to use you for something here
I mean just
I don't think it's like that sweetie I think you're overreacting
Well , I think e- the behavior indicates that , at least
At lea- at least , you know , Mist , Mister Mister very sensitive and aware of other people's behavior is obviously not super aware of his own a little bit
So
No you know that
Well , no , but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway , righ
Well I'll just
I I mean
I will , I'll act abrupt then also , so it's it's sort of funny
Well
But anyway
The movie was good yesterday , though
I a- , I'm I I might call him back Monday
Well sweetie , what am I supposed to d
You know
oh you're not supposed to do anything , I'll take care of it
ah I I am going to mention to him that I did think it was sort of rude that he didn't do that and all I get is this message blah , you know
Well , you could , yeah , I mean I think it's valid for you to yell at him for standing you guys up and stuff
And
Well it wasn't a- official plan , but , it's not as if he gave me a number to contact him at
yeah
yeah , so I just , I was a little bit ,
a little bit put off by it
yeah
You know
And , and I was saying
Well he could probably say that he felt put off by you too
So
I don't think so
I was the one who suggested going out and doing something
yeah
The only thing he can be say put off by me is that my h- life hangs in the balance , and I would like to be left alone
I don't think that that's unreasonable
yeah
You know , I e- you know , it's
Well , I know , I agree , but i- , you know , um , also , if , you know , uh , you're not going to be there
During this week or two , or whatever
The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a so- soft place to lie your head down and fall asleep , and wake up , y- , cook food or whatever
and , putz around once in a while , that's fine
But if you want a place where , you know , it's it's time for a Saturday_Night_Fever party , I'm sorry , i- e- that's
oh , come on
he's not quite like that , I mean good grief
Yes , but still , that's kind of my ,
you know
no he's got people that he hasn't seen for a quite a while
But don't they , don't they live somewhere
Well
You know what I'm saying
Well , n- , not all of them
eh , I mean , I get the impression not all of them can you go back to that place
I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it
No , but anyway
Well , because , I , some of them ,
you know , it's
oh , I understand , I think I understand what you were saying now
yeah
I think I figured it out that ,
yeah
So he would like to have a place where eh they can come and visit him
yeah
And so ,
and so
It's fine with me
Never mind , I thought about a hilarious word play
But anyway , never mind
Wha
I , I don't want to say
But that's it's not , it's not , it's , uh , it's a word play on what you just said , it's kind_of a switcheroo , it's , but i- , i- , it , th- , it comes in it comes i- there's some truth to it , you know
oh
oh
What's , what is i
Well th- th- he or they can they can visit him and come on him
ah , ha , ha
uh ,
Instead of coming and visiting
yeah , well , okay
I just
But , I I mean , anyway
Anyway
So , e- , my , my , my thought on the whole thing is that
you know , if if you visited him , you wouldn't want to have to be
you know , spent panting and spending every second of the day , w- with him only
You know what I'm saying and that
probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with him is that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever and g- and
Wher
What are you talking abou
In Japan
I'm not going to Japan
No , but I mean
I'm trying to
May- , maybe in ten years , but , no time soon
No , no , but , no , you know what I'm saying
When you are visiting a town and you stay at someone's house and you can't ever do anything on your own and stuff like that
So
oh , I don't mind he does stuff on my e- his own
I just uh ,
you know , I mean there's a difference between guests and there's a difference between ownership , I think
I think that
I know
but
There , I mean , if if if I live somewhere , you know , I can rearrange the furniture
yeah
But if I'm staying somewhere , it doesn't mean I'm I'm I'm in jail
I mean just because I'm in a motel , doesn't mean I'm going to repaint the walls
But it doesn't mean that I'm obligated to stay there either
oh well I know but e-
I'm just saying there are different degrees of , you know I I , and I don't think he's obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me the entire time either
I wouldn't want him to
yeah
You know I told him , I said I have no time to do anything
And I I said I
Well maybe that's why he was trying
And as soon as as soon as I move back here , he's out
I I I'm I'm to- totally insist on it
I don't care if he never talks to me again
Because , there's no way I can study with worrying about keeping somebody awake , or , you know , I have to worry how w- , how I'm dressed , if I'm clean
You know
Whatever
yeah well , I I agree with that sweetie
But , in that case , I think that while
I mean he can stay while I'm at Erzhebat's , that's fine
That's just
Ex- , that was my point
That was my whole point
That
yeah
okay
What is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling him to do what he wants
And
Well I have to go make a copy too
Do you want me to , well
Give him the keys and
You know what I'm saying
And I'm kind of thinking about saying , well here's here give me a couple of bucks , I'll make a copy
yeah , or just give him , just
give him your set of keys one day when you're studying and say here , and bring it back
You know , go make a copy and then bring it back
And ,
I I mean I don't think it's that unreasonable for him to ask for a key when I , e- you know , at least I anyway ,
yeah
yeah
okay maybe not you , have offered long time ago that oh , yes , you can stay here and blahdeeblah
yeah
And j- he knows that you're not going to be there
So I think that you know , I d- I don't think that it's unreasonable at all
okay , yeah
I just think he needs to know that there are limits
Or whatever
That I don't want it , I mean I'd like to be able to come here ,
during the day , anytime
And not feel like if I need a book or something
yeah
uhhuh
I don't want to feel restrained because it'll frustrate me
uhhuh
and I won't be able to concentrate
Well , I think that that would be reasonable
Just e- , make an agreement with him at what time you know , after what time of day will you call f- before you come over
yeah
You kno
Or , you know , so like , between ,
um , eight P M and
you know ten A M
I'll , if I c- have to come over then I'll call first
Like that
I mean I don't think that's unreasonable , you kno
Or something like that
yeah
Because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know what's going on
yeah
You know
yeah
And , and plus , you know , you're going to be at , uh , Suzanne's for what , till the eleventh or somethin
No till
Well that's right
yeah when you come back I guess I'll be I'll still be there
Still be there right
So
because you'll be around
Right so and then so just
But you'll be over here packing at that time , partially
yeah partially sure of course
I deposited your other rent loan check that came in
oh good
How much was i
And I it was nineteen something
okay
the the thing is I took out
two hundred and fifty out of the account
I'm going to pay the electric bill
I'm going to pay
M B N A
I'm going to pay some other people
okay
That sounds good
really
over a hundred d-
I read that in like in Chicago they said they're preparing for another heat wave
mhm
but then I watched Sunday Morning or part of Sunday Morning
mhm
and it didn't it showed it only in the eighties so I'm like
somebody's not telling the truth here it's hot over here though too
oh it it's really mhm
it'll be I I think when you let's see you'll be coming in
last year I remember that it was rainy in August but
this year's so bizarre that you might hit it when it's really nice
hm
you're too
that'd be cool I mean it's just been h- unreal bad here
really
dry
humid
mhm the other day we went to see Waterworld
uhhuh
it's kind of fun
is it good
yeah it's kind of good
is it worth I mean there was a_lot_of hype or whatever that it was not going to be a good movie
well because they spent so much money on it I c- I think for the amount of money that was spent it's it's not the you know it's not /
not
the blockbuster maker /
uhhuh
deal but it's it w- it was good
really
I mean it's just you sit there and it's very tense because it's all action
uhhuh
all of it it's all action
mhm
and it was fun watching the credits
mhm
the credits rolled for at least a half hour I waited for a half hour Tom went /
you're kidding
Tom went outside he goes I am not into this he goes you can watch I said that's fine so I watched it
for half and hour
for a half hour because I don't know it was just it was just funny because I could not believe
how many different things were involved in this movie
mhm
and I figured there would be so I wanted to watch the credits and it was they were still rolling after a half hour
you're kidding
no it was a half hour worth of credits
jeez is it a long movie
yeah it actually is it's about two and half hours
wow every you know what
but you don't feel like it because it's moves so fast
you don't I just have something about going to movies now I feel like
w- whatever happened to the hour and a half movie I need those
those are w- that's my attention span after that it's like
I'm out of here I can't watch anything over two hours is okay when it gets in
yeah
two and a half hours is like no way even if it's the best movie I have to watch it in two parts and that's when I have to do it on video
yeah
it was it was a bit long because of you know you're dealing with the same there there
it's a cartoon mentality /
mhm
type of film but the action's interesting the special it's not
is the acting good
yeah it's okay the kid there's a kid in there that's really fun you'd like the kid because she's just /
uhhuh
doesn't stop
uhhuh
she's good you know she goes you're going to be in trouble you know she doesn't care what she says
mhm
and so it's kind of fun
uhhuh
she's kind_of a cool character Costner's interesting because he's not really a he's kind_of a bad good guy
uhhuh
and
y- there aren't very many I mean there there aren't very many special effects which was why this
movie was so expensive I mean there is animation and stuff in the c-
mhm
Lord knows I saw the credits so I I don't know
uhhuh
but but it's it's a_lot_of it's real
mhm
what they do it's so it's pretty incredible when you when you
watching it and the- it's kind of funny the idea of smokers these the bad guys are all smokers
mhm
and they smoke
oh
it is just funny
uhhuh
I mean that whole thing's kind of funny Tom and I were cracking up about that
oh that's fun when did you see it this weekend
mhm
uhhuh
yeah we went to well no we went he took the day off Friday because he took me to the doctor
uhhuh
so we went to the doctor and then we went to this movie afterwards so
uhhuh
yeah
wow so
so it was kind of cool
uhhuh have you gone back to city lately or
huh-uh I was thinking about going before we go to Florida because I wanted to take maybe take Gritti out there although we have
one person that would look after Gritti here
uhhuh
she's so Todd-like you got to meet this /
0
guy he just makes me think of Todd
really
big time the only thing that's /
different about him from Todd is that he has a kid you know
oh gosh
and that's about it
he likes fifties
yeah
he does
what was that the other day we were looking at something he goes wow that's so fifties that's so cool it's you know
gosh
like oh my /
0
God this /
0
guy is /
Todd he's super nice though you know
oh get him away from me
0
is he
he's pretty nice yeah
well that's good
oh I wanted to tell you Matt's dad died
oh really
yeah
oh
in one of the heat waves here
you are kidding
no
ooh
yeah
um July fourteenth they think he died
oh
from what they could tell
was he living by himself
yeah you know he always had been since Matt left
uhhuh
and he had this little house in south Omaha although he had air conditioning you know
Tom and I were talking about this he had air conditioning but I wonder if he didn't shut it off at night or something
uhhuh
and he because he died in the morning they think
oh wow
hm was he pretty old
yeah he was
uhhuh
he was
well was he has he just was he still drinking
no
oh he wasn't
he he quit drinking for some time but he was just you know he's a pretty crotchety cranky guy /
yeah hm
old guy you know but /
hm
still you know
yeah right
anyway Matt came back here but Matt didn't call me it was weird
Matt didn't call me I didn't hear from him or anything and he you know
hm
we're not we are listed
yeah
and he had my old number but I don't know he was here for two weeks so
hm how did you find out
I didn't here from him Lisa Bradley
oh
Lisa Bradley called me just the other day and she goes did you hear about Matt's dad and I was like no
0
and she heard from Maggie Maggie had called Lisa and Lisa had call me
mhm
so
hm
yeah that is kind of
so I sent him a card and stuff
mhm
hm
but I know how that is too you're so out of it when something like that happens that I
right
you know that that's unders- /
that right that you can't
that's understandable but I was kind of surprised
uhhuh
for him to have been here two weeks and I guess you know he was at the house
and moving stuff he took a_lot_of stuff back they pretty much settled as much of the property as possible /
mhm
right afterwards
well Matt's where now Chicago
yeah
uhhuh
yeah
yeah
so anyway
yeah probably just
hm
but that's alri- I mean you know we weren't we've kind of been
he had a_lot_of things to take care of and
we've kind of been drifting apart anyway over the last couple of years so
yeah
anyway but I sent him a card and stuff
uhhuh that was nice of you
yeah
mhm
yeah well thanks
huh
you said well that's nice I said well thanks
anyway so I just thought I'd tell you that I don't know what else can I tell you
well
but anyway the surgery thing can I tell you one more time
mhm
it was cool because it was such an assembly line thing I couldn't believe how efficient they were
uhhuh
it was almost I mean it was almost fun you know you're in this dream state and you can kind of hear what they're saying
I remember them saying oh this is much bigger ohmygosh we got to go through the bone
this is much bigger than we planned
they had to go yeah they had to go around the bone I guess there was another bone and
ew
it was weird my hand
did you feel like people were just like you weren't there
I felt like it was you know what it was a_lot less of a problem than having my wisdom teeth out
uhhuh
oh and that that was a_lot worse than this
uhhuh
and you know and I wasn't in a surgery room or anything I mean this was full blown surgery they had monitors
on me and they were going to give me oxygen in case something went wrong because they were
jeez
they were concerned about that I mean it was pretty serious I guess but
uhhuh
but they put a tourniquet on my arm and it was it was weird it was weird but anyway what did you ask me
did you feel like you weren't
you were just kind of observ-
oh oh it was kind of like
I don't know it was it was
kind of like a kind of like a dream but that's not right kind of like when you're just waking up but you never just
hm distortion
quite wake up
mhm
your eyes are open you can hear things but they aren't quite connecting
mhm
you're you're in slow motion that's I guess
like when you take a_lot_of cold medicine
yeah
yeah there you go lot of cold medicine like /
slow motion /
is what it felt like
uhhuh
like okay
and it was funny but you know I everything was going really good until last night
uh Tom had his arm around me when we were watching that movie
0
and I kind of d- I wanted to readjust
mhm
and I forgot that my hand doesn't really want to bend certain ways yet
mhm
and I did it anyway and it ohmygod and it it was it bruised
ooh
my fingers bruised something I must have /
ouch
like broke some blood vessels but it's I mean it's O K it's just weird /
mhm mhm
it's just weird to watch this heal
that would be kind of
it's I mean I don't know
it would be kind of fun though I'm like
it is kind of fun
you I kind of like to watch when bruises turn colors and
I well I mean w- just the just the healing I'm surprised my body is healing
0
y- y- considering I've had that infection
mhm
below so f- so long it's that
yeah that you'd actually get to observe something
something that's going to h- work
going to heal it's like
you know
cool
this is neat and then there's stitches it looks like a big chicken but it's kind of cool
well I get the stitches out Thursday
uhhuh
so it's goo- it's going really well
well that's good sounds like things are going better
well yeah I think it was good to have that done I think it was good to finally find a doctor that said yeah I'm going to listen to you
mhm
and those kinds of things and then you know
mhm
and
and all I get along with
and then you're going on your trip
and I got a really good roommate and stuff
that's good
that's cool
Gritti's pretty cool huh
Gritti's neat
last night last night we sat outside it was really fun we we I don't know have you ever played cribbage
mm mm
I always thought you know it's like this British kind of cribbage but
cribbage
Tom Tom kept bugging me the last couple of weeks he goes he goes
he goes would you be interested in learning cribbage I'm like why do you play he goes yeah he goes I w- I would think that'd be fun
so anyway we were last night we well we played a game in the morning and then
we didn't play again because it was so hot we had gone outside
uhhuh
and because we got this this that's right you've not been here we have a like a table outside it's kind of cool on this deck
uhhuh
well anyway we were playing last night it was dark but we didn't want to put the bug light because you know
uhhuh
so it was it was we got we had we had chocolates and and and /
God
water and we were just really decking it and we and I bought this candle holder thing it's really neat
uhhuh
at a thrift store for fifty cents it's like iron
uhhuh
and it's for long stemmed candle you know like like not long stemmed candles that's roses long long you know what are they called taper candles
right like uhhuh
and so we put a bunch of those in there and we lit them
mhm
and it was really cool we were playing cribbage last night by candlelight we
played until like midnight or something
cool
yeah that was really fun
that's fun did you win
no
I suck I mean I'm just learning but it w- but I mean I didn't l- I didn't lose bad or anything I was kind of
you're just learning
uhhuh
he didn't skunk me or nothing
mm
but it was it was so funny and we and and then we were worried about
I don't know it's just funny because the neighbors
the the the deck itself has like
i- i- i- i- it's just planks
mhm
and so we kept dropping stuff he first
gaw
he's first Tom he was like he was drinking beer and he spilled the beer
he goes I don't know what's wrong with me he goes I'm not Italian I never do stuff like that
So what have you been up t
ah nothing really
We've
yeah
We've had a big change of leadership over here
oh yea
yeah , the base C O changed
The clinic O I C changed
The clinic
C U nurse changed
And ,
just trying to get uh , you know , the feel for how everybody else is
you know , going to respond to them , and how they're going to respond to
everybody else , has been trying , to say the least , for the past oh , probably , month or so
yeah
So
Well , I mean that's still a possibility
I mean I just didn't /
yeah
feel like it was the right time when I was home last
So
I don't know , I saw Sayonara again
I still see you with some little gal flying around going Karisan , Karisan
The supper is ready
Get thy ass on the table
No
Nothing like that going on over here
yeah
Well I'll tell you another a- , y- Did you hear about Martha getting marrie
No
Well this supposedly is going to happen
Now it hasn't actually happened yet
So e- we may be at ground zero
I called her to , to chat whether I guess about two weeks ago
um
And she'd said , oh , hey Bill
By the way , I'm getting married This is a typical Martha pronouncement
Ye-
It's like , oh , okay
uh , you know , e- , tell me about this guy
How long have you known him and all that
oh well I've been dating him in since April
but I haven't really told anybody
And I thought well this is true , cause Martha you and I have been in pretty good touch since April , and you never mentioned it
But this guy supposedly is a retired Marine pilot
um
He just retired out , so he's kind of thinking what he wants to do now
I think for some reason the guy was an A six driver
And , uh , it seems like they just really hit it off and clicked
And I think he has one child but he doesn't have custody
um
So I don't have a whole lot of scoop on this guy
But they haven't set a date or anything
They just decided they were going to get married , and do it real informal and all this and
I know
So
I asked if he was drinking buddies with Luke and that didn't go over real good
So
So I don't know a whole lot of the scoop
But , uh , she's still in San Diego and seems to have settled pretty much there
uh
In mine uh , I've changed qui- I'm trying to remember
Last time I probably talked to you was what , last sprin
yeah
I know , we're the , we're the world's best at keeping in touch
Well I'm on the road now moving from New Orleans
I'm finally left The Big Easy , and I'm going up to , believe it or not , for graduate school
oh , you are
yeah
I finally decided to go ahead and get on the ball
And , I knew I wanted to teach English as a second language as a career but I'd never really done anything about it
So I started doing it in New Orleans as a private tutor and then got picked up by a little private school down there to teach for a couple of months And knew this was what I wanted to do so I got it
I applied and got accepted into graduate school up in Vermont , specializes in kicking you out into a one year Master's program
do that
So this starts in late August and I'm on the way up there kind of meandering up to the states and seeing anybody and everybody
So if your dead old behind was in the States , I could , you know , make a point to go by and find you but since you're still in /
yeah
the land of large explosions , I haven't been able to do that
yeah
Well your tour is what three years , Ker , or did you get
No , it's only two
I've only got about six months left over here
I was going to say I thought you were winding up
Do you know where you're going ye
yeah Twenty Nine Stumps
You're kidding me
No
aw , good deal
I think I know some folks out there
yeah , well , you know
I d- I called the detailer , and , I had originally , uh , applied for a fellowship to work with the Joint Commission Accreditation Hospitals
mhm
Which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in Chicago which
the , the town that they had this
fellowship in was
like five minutes from where I went to college and /
Right
ten minutes from where I went to high school
Right
So I thought yeah it'd be great
You know
But , uh , they picked some physician to go
yeah
So the only other choice they gave me was either , uh , Great Mistakes
mhm
or Twenty Nine Palms
mhm
And , the detailer , uh
I said , well , let me think about it for a while
An- , and , probably forty five minutes after I hung up with her , she called me back ,
and said that she had spoken to the director of nursing out at Twenty Nine Palms
mhm
and the director of nursing out there
wanted me
to be the department head for emergency nursing
Wow
So ,
I don't know this lady , but , you know , I've got my sub specialty in that and /
Sure
with the experience that I've got , so
You know , I eventually got back to her and said yeah I'll go ahead and go out there
yeah
Well I was going to say
Because I know you're still the lieutenant commander , righ
yeah
okay
Ar- are you looking towards ho- , how soon would commander be coming around the pike for you Kerr
ah , well , I would be in zone next , next year
okay , so that wouldn't blow the department head thing if you pick up commander would i
But
No , no , uh
But guess who got deep selected
For commande
yeah
Let me think
oh , it's got to be Barney
oh yeah
Well now , I also heard
Now I think I heard this from Martha
I heard Barney had some kind of terminal disease
Well , Barney has cancer
okay
uh he had some sort of uh , /
uh , /
mouth and throat cancer
yeah
You know he's a big golfer
Right
And golfers tend to , when th- after they tee off they stick their golf tee in their mout
oh no
yeah , well they think that this cancer developed from the the bug spray and the weed killer that they put on the the grass
oh man
yeah , so I I saw Barn- I was back in the States in March
And , uh ,
I saw Barney at this convention that I was at
yeah
And , he was as skinny as you are
You're kidding me
No
Good god
Cause he was always built like a seal or something
He was huge
yeah
And uh , you know he had gone through chemotherapy , and was in the process of getting radiation so he like had
you know , one hair per
square inch on his head
yeah
And , uh , could barely talk because that's where they were focusing the radiation
Right
uh , and he looked u- he looked like death warmed over
You know he
yeah
You see the Auschwitz pictures , and that was Barney
Barney Lipstien
yeah
yeah
But , um , yeah he worked for , uh , General /
Krulac
okay
okay
You just said the magic words
So
mhm
I got you
yeah I've got another buddy who , uh , is a marine pilot
I'm trying to think if you had ever met
this guy
I don't think so
He , um , worked for him as an aide
And so he was chuckling the other day , w- , well probably the other day the other year when he heard Krulac had been selected to be the next big boy
And he thought you know , Bill whatever happens , I'm good to go now , I'm golden
oh yeah
yeah , it was it was a real surprise to hear , e- and when I talked to Barney he wasn't /
Wow
we didn't really spend a whole lot of time talking about the the cancer
yeah
yeah
But I I asked him , I said , you know , I asked him point blank , I said what was what the prognosis was
yeah
And he said poor
um , but he didn't say terminal
yeah
um
okay I think I had kind_of assumed that I guess from talking to Martha because she may have over glorified it
I don't know
Well , you know ,
and Barney's wife Barb is down in Sansabel
mhm
And I talk to her fairly frequently
And she said that um ,
mhm
she just saw him a couple of months ago
mhm
And that he was starting to gain weight back again
So
Super
You know , I don't know whether they managed to get all the cancer with the chemotherapy and the radiation or , or what
yeah
But
You know I y- I knew when the list came out I didn't even have to look , you know , because I knew that both Barney and I were , um , eligible
mhm
Not in zone but eligible
mhm
And u- I knew of anybody , he would be the one that would be deep selected
Well , being buds with old Chuck Krulac didn't hurt things a whole lot either
oh no
Not at all
And , you know , when I ran into him , uh , in March , it was at the
some symposium in San Diego , a Nurse Corps thing
yeah
And , um , Admiral Engel , the Nurse Corps admiral was there
And
You know , Barney knows her like they're best buds
So , you_know , I'm
No more new pictures with vice president sons on stretchers
uh , no , not yet
I was expecting to see him taping up Socks or Chelsea any day now
Well , it wouldn't surprise me either
Emergency surgeon Barney Berens flown into the White House today
He's he's talking about going to
D C next
But
mhm
I guess you got to spend a year in San_Diego for follow up
yeah
oh
And then , uh , after the whole episode called her back later , didn't remember it ever happened , and said you know , we got to g- got to get together sometime
oh jeez
So I think this is what preempted Martha to , uh
All her old beaus are definitely losing it
I think it prompted her to get married
I'm trying to think if I've got any other news
I hadn't been as much in touch
with the other folks tha- know Martha
I usually am at least keeping abreast of things
I think Pete and Jennifer
still there you know she picked up lieutenant commander
yeah I s- I saw Jennifer at the same conference
oh okay
yeah
Does she still look like a Teutonic pinu
mhm
oh man
Although her hair color is getting a little darker
oh reall
yeah she's not she's not bleaching it out quite as much
I didn't know she was a bleached blond
Are you kidding me
oh yeah
um I took them to Jill's and they spent two days there and I guess she couldn't take them and their mom and dad came
You mean at te- in Texa
yeah
And their mom and dad drove down there and got them
mhm
Got them
yeah
So how are they getting bac
Driving them
t- driving them back
oh
Darn it
I thought I was going to get to see everybody
Well they was w-
They was supposed to do no
come back like a while ago but Jill like she keeps farting around and won't want to go get them and
mm
So I said and then she j-
Did she have her baby ye
yeah
She had a girl
mm
Six pounds or something like that
I don't know
hey ain't my concern
Good
Good for you
So you've been leading the life of Reilly hu
No
Not really
Just I haven't been home much this summer and w-
And busier than hell hu

Well no

Do yo

It's just that
You know I was gone

Same car

What else is going o
You're busy with work and
yeah
I work ten at night to six in the morning Bo Bo's happy because uh he don't have to go back to day care
Right
When do you sleep the
I p- I sleep probably a couple hours in the morning and then like at nap time
yeah
You never did require much sleep
No
yeah
So has , has the old man and the old lady called you latel
No
oh
Ain't worried about it
You know your sister was
in Illinois recently
She wa
yeah
What fo
Her old man kicked her out of the /
out of her house
yeah
Well Jill's been getting the shit beat out of her and all that at
You're kidding
No
Well don't get sucked into that
oh I'm not
Her baby's got colic and she did funny
oh
Sounds like a real mess
Too bad
So is she home for goo
No
He took her bac
No
He didn't take her back but his mom was going to buy her a car /
so that she'd stay out there and sure enough she's staying out there
oh yeah
She working it
hu
She working it
So anyway she called me a couple days before she was going to come home and and I go
can you tell me why you would stay in a place where you know
you're not wanted
in a state you know that where you don't know hardly anybody
So then it that's when it all came out
She said well Pat I think her name's Patty , Patty's going to buy me a car
She's going to help me out
I said
Kara you know why she's going to do that is because she wants
the kid to stay there so she can see your grandson
mhm
so she got all pissed off at me
I said you're being used
You're being bought
Man she going to be like Jill become
I said why don't you
so I said why don't you stand up on your own two feet
She going to be like Jill and become a product of the state and shit live off welfare and god damn
Then you know what she said to m
What
She said
, and this sounded just like something like uh her mother inlaw or w- I don't know th- what the hell relationsh- it wouldn't be mother inlaw
What Drew's mom
probably is saying to her
Kara says well I have to do what's right for David
oh
And I said no Kara you have to do what's right for Kara
And what's right for Kara will be right for David
That's right
As long as you feed him , love him and take care of him
oh well I don't want him to not know his daddy
I'm like
Wh
I wouldn't I w- , I you know what I could never be with someone who didn't love me
Could yo
Hell no
I don't get that
I don't get that
Anyway so I spouted my mouth off
Well I
Good for you
I have to tell you the week before I met
uh
the sergeant and lieutenant at the Des Moines McDonald's
because they were dropping off Shawn
Sergeant and lieutenan
Jennings
hu
Sergeant and lieutenant Jennings
You talking about mom and da
yeah
eh here's why I call them that
So we're sitting there in McDonald's p- and I'm they had Shawn for a week and we're visiting and , and they start in on me right away
And you keep your mouth shut and you don't say this and you don't say that and don't say this and don't say that
It was the whole time was was nothing but a big fucking lecture
You say oh I've got to go
So I think , I think I did that on purpose
Good for you
Well then the following weekend was father's day
And we were supposed to all meet in Des M-
oh that was to drop Shawn off
okay
yeah And then we're going to meet and pick Shawn up and see Kara and David
I've never seen that kid
Have no clue what he , well you haven't either
uh-uh
So
we get there and there's dad with his hands in his pocket and he meets us out at the car and , and
um mom was sitting on the bench for once not huddling around dad
And I said where's Kara He said well she didn't come
And I said what
He said no she didn't come
She she didn't like the last two conversations that she had with you
She doesn't , didn't like what you s- you had to say to her
So they still backing her
And you want to know somethin
Wha
They probably told her it was okay not to come
They probably said yeah we don't like how she talks to us either
I bet , what do you want to bet because
don't you think they could have made her com
yeah
They would've made anybody else come
Sure
They would've said get your ass in the car
Whether y-
Say god damn we don't want to hear no fucking shit
Let's go
Whether you're thirty six or twenty six it don't matter
yeah
You would've been in that god damn car
Well
it was just like well we'll show her for spouting her mouth off
She won't get to see the baby
yeah
Exactly
We'll punish her
So then he just calls
The old man just calls me and says
I got my messy mess- message machine and says yeah we want to we want Ryan to come out
We don't think it's fair that Ryan can't come out
And cause I , I , I said I'm not going to meet them in Des Moines
I c- , I can't be with them Tad
I get I , I lose two weeks of my life every time I'm with them
Mentally I can't take it
Well why do you think nobody else has no /
I , I can't , I can't do it anymore
contact with them
I , I just can't
I mean that pissed me off the last time they were here so
But it's never their fault
It's never for anything that they've done
I know that and I mean i- i- you get blamed , you still get blamed for shit and , and lectured about shit that happens when you're a kid or , or , or whatever and all that I mean
Well I don't get it for that but so then dad , dad says now why don't you want to go to Des_Moines and I said because I don't
I said I thought we'd already been through this cause I already told them I didn't want to go to Des_Moines
And he goes well then we'll drive to Omaha and pick up sh- Ryan and , and then we'll bring him back and then we'll bring him back home to Omaha
And I said
mm
oh so you're not and the whole thing is that I won't let them stay in my house anymore
Because I can't have that twenty four hour bitching and negative
I can't
I can't live like that
yeah
yeah
You know what I'm sayin
mhm
It's just twenty four hours
So I said so , so let me understand this so you're coming , you're picking him up and you're leavin
You're not stayin
Right
And I go hm well it sounds like we're back to the same old
argument And I said so you're going to punish me because you're offended that I don't particularly want you to stay here in my home
Well no it's not punishing
I said well then what do you call it
I mean I just came out and said it
yeah
No you just don't un- I said no dad
I think it's you don't understand
You don't understand how you affect my family
You and mom
And and more importantly how you affect me And he said that's your problem
You think too much about yourself
And I said goodbye dad
hm
And I hung the phone up
Good for you
Why does , why does our life have to be like thi
I don't get it
Well they're the ones who created it
They're n-
Why do they have to be like tha
I don't know and
Dad You know what I said to dad when he met me at the um when he came up to our door and said Kara's not coming cause she doesn't like y- you know what I said to him
Wha
I said I hope that my , my sons never treat one another like this
True
I don't think my kids will be that way
And he just looked at me
Well you've got a point but
I see
I think
No I have to come back because I don't think all my stuff will fit in , in our vehicles
So I have to come back
But , yeah
huh
it's a_lot_of airport shenanigans
I was really upset
I didn't know
hu
I didn't know
yeah ,
It's not my fault
It's going to be awful
Wha
It's going to be awful this trip home
Wh
Because I'm leaving here at
uhhuh
six in the evening ,
uhhuh
getting to San_Francisco at uh , eleven in the morning ,
uhhuh
and then hanging around the airport until kid Ted gets out of work
Wait a minute
The same morning isn't i
yeah
uhhuh
earlier
Hang around the airport until whe
Hanging around the airport until Ted gets out of work
um that's awful
Like six , six hours later and then
mm
I think you should just come here
and then Sunday , so I will have slept on the plane
mhm
The only sleep I'll have gotten is on the plane
uhhuh
And then Sunday night I'm taking a redeye which leaves
At
at eleven fifteen
P
y- yeah
Because you said redeye and then get there at
And arrive arrives in , uh , Chicago at four fifty seven
And then you go to Washington
The only sleep I'll get is from eleven fifteen to f- to five in the morning , honestly
Is this the one that goes to Washingto
um , Chica- , no Chicago and then Syracuse
oh that's nice
My original one went , my original one went to Washington and then Syra-
Maybe you should take that one , though , because it comes earlier , doesn't i
No , it wasn't an option for some reason
oh
Maybe it was full or something
um , but still maybe , you know , maybe you should just get on the next plane , instead of waiting around for Ted
You'll be back here by the time he gets there
You would
yeah
yeah
Well maybe not because if connections , can't go direct
Whine
um , but you're going to go mountain bikin
Maybe
That would be fun
Does he have a mountain bike for yo
yeah
Does h
Well apparently , because he offered
Because he offered , yeah
And he , I would imagine that he would know that you're not travelling around with your bicycle
Right
And that you don't get to keep the yours as a souvenir
Right
Or anything fun like that
it's not a mountain bike
hu
and it's not a mountain bike anyway
No , and y- in some of your letters it sounds like you wouldn't really want to
keep it , really
Just
I did go up a mountain on it
But
hu
I did go up a mountain , well , not on it , with it
oh
Pushing it
Do you have legs of stee
No
I have knees of pain
You have knees of pain you have ouchies
I forgot to delete e- ouchies from
yeah you told me
Did I tell you tha
And they said ouchies
yeah
And I , yeah , I explained a little bit
Trying very hard not to be silly
It's very , it's very difficult to explain this with any kind of straight face
reall
w- I didn't mind that I was smiling , but without , like ,
y- you can't e- how do you explain i
I'm very silly and I , I s- I say ouchies , because
it it
it's ah
And the funny thing is it was Becky that questions it
Because Becky speaks such , you know , standard English
She speaks stand- standard English
Right
Standard vocabulary
but but ouchies just really struck her as something very odd
He yeah
And wh- my other thing to tell you , wha
shower today
Wha
I don't get a shower today
oh that's gross
I'm sorry
because I'm talking to you on the phone instead
because you're going to go on the , why can't you take quick showe
They close at ten
All , well , oh , oh no
That's right
oh , I'm sorry
It's okay
You were supposed to get a shower weren't yo
yeah
yeah
um , oop
It's all right
I was try- I was here
I have funny things on me
So I went to the doctor
But I made an appointment for seven
And by ten of eight , and I still hadn't been seen , and I had just gotten my name called
So I had to come back , because I was going to call you at eight
hm
yeah
And , yeah
All my ouchies are always skin ouchies
I think of this
And all your ouchies are always in- inner ouchies huh
You got new skin ouchies new skin ouchie
New skin ouchies
hm
They're not ouchy at all , actually
They're jus- they're just there
And they're very disturbing
I'm really worried , actually
To , uh , see anybody , so nobody , but um , I couldn't get a or two in
Are you going to cam
hu
Are you going to cam
I don't know about that either
I wanted to
But
But , all I have is my own car
And it's a two hour drive , and it'll be at night , and I'll be by myself , in my car
And what about tomorrow mornin
I could go tomorrow morning and turn around and come back tomorrow evening
oh , you were going to come back tomorrow evenin
Well I have to
What
Because , they're they're coming back tomorrow evening
I guess I don't have to
I could stay there all by myself
But
mm
uh
I'm kind of bored of being by myself , I've been , they left yesterday , so I've been by myself an awful lot because I didn't have a job today
mhm
So , you know , I'm kind of not looking forward to that , or anything
So
I don't what do you thin
It it sounds a little scary to drive , you know , in your car
Alone at night
eh yeah
That far
yeah
So maybe I should wait until tomorrow
But I don't , see the other thing is , I don't know when they're coming back tomorrow
mhm
So if they're coming back tomorrow morning , then we'll pass each other on the way
mhm
And that would be really bad
mhm
I would really be unhappy
mhm
What do I d
It sounds like you probably don't go to camp this weekend
eh , don't go c- , that means don't go to camp this summer
You haven't gon
No
You went for the Fourth of July
m- , oh right
Not my camp though
oh you didn't
I just wanted to go st- hu
You didn't go to your cam
No not at all
We just stayed at George Miranza's
What hm
I mean it was nice , but I wanted to see my camp
I want to go for a walk on my road
Of course I wanted you to be there
But , you know
I sh- be I can't be mean , you're almost home
No you're not
So do I skip schoo
I don't think you'll have to

No I don't have to
But you come in at ten
No I don't think you , yeah
You come in at ten , and I got to leave at noon
yeah
That's not fun
At all
It's better than nothing
yeah maybe
yeah and then
It actually just might make me cry and then
And then the food
That'll be what da
That'll be Monday
yeah
Then when will you some to Rocheste
I can co- I don't know
When are you going to Rocheste
mm soon as I've overcome jet lag , probably
Well , by that time , I can't g- , then it won't be until the weekend
I can go on Monday night
I can go to Rochester
I don't assume that you'd be going there Monday night
But I can get there Tuesday , because I don't have another class until Thursday
Because Iggers is out of town
yeah , I could do that maybe
y- you'd go to Rochester on Tuesda
yeah , maybe
Pleas
okay
aw
You'll just say okay , and then I'll think you are , and then you'll say no
Are you going are you going to say no late
um , no
I think I'll go
You think you're going to go on Tuesda
Where are you going to sta
I have to find , I have to find a place
Where are you going to stay while you find a plac
um , I don't know
I guess I'll come back home in the evenings
That's how
how much I need it
I could go to Buffalo
I was going to say you could do that
And we could drive
I'd , yeah
yeah , that would be okay or we could take a bus
mhm
both ways
mm , we'd have to park my car somewhere
oh
oh , well I forgot you'd have your car
I forgot I forgot a-
oh I could take a bus to there too
hu
I could take a bus
I just don't want to drive my car back and forth , like every day
Right
I don't mind driving back and forth everyday if you're going to be there with me
oh you'd do tha
yeah , I need to find a place
Will you come see me on Tuesda
mhm
I'd be much happier
mhm
oh yeah
Much , much happier
good whew
I'm out of the doghouse
Like
Wha
yeah
oh yeah , there's something else
huh
There's something else
What'd I d
No , no
It's what you didn't do , and you whined about it
Didn't get to see your , um , sun sai in their bathing suit
yeah
oops
Hi Karen
Funny Aron
oh , but there was something else that was funny , where did it go
There was something that was really funny
You said something really funny
oh , it was something about , it was something about your decision
oh
um
a bad , not a hard decision because that would imply that you had the part that and it wasn't you that had the problem
mhm
That was really funny
I laughed
I really did
And also you sent me very nice mail
and I was upset
That was long mail I sent
yeah , that one was really big
but I think the typing was
you know you have forty four pages of this stuf
Reall
Forty three I have some about this information about this call
That's cool
So type forty three pages
you know and not of normal spacing
I fixed it all so it
short like the email kind of copy short , you know
like halfway across the scr- forty three screen um weird margins , but yeah
my mom said you really enjoyed
She yeah you mentioned that Je- I didn't I haven't spoken to her really I haven't spoken to her about it
it so I didn't really get to hear about it
But I'm glad that was that was nice
yeah the censored version and then I saw that they wanted to give it to your grandparents
mhm yeah
But yeah I don't really see where
mom wanted to see you with edit
hu
Did she ask you for help editing i
No she didn't because I saw that you offered that I would and I would have had no problem , but hu
She wants she wants to two revisionists
She wants to edit you out
Well , of course
How was she going to how was she going to have exp- explain tha
oh right
yeah he's running to Becky's friend because
She's got email and we didn't
Well that's I guess that does work , actually
She could say that
Because all the except the ouchies well mm no , they don't need to know but yeah that jus-
0
edit me out
I so that I'm all gone
hm are you having fu
some
Re- Emotionally having fu
It's hard there , isn't i
yeah , it's hard
Some of these calls I made didn't go through
One of them went through and it was
So how are yo
I'm fine
How are yo
I'm alright
I'm
You sound really far away
I think this is a really bad connection because , there's a d- there's a little bit of a lag
And it's , it's really staticky
Do I sound staticky to yo
No , you sound quite clear
oh
Well I suppose that's okay
I'll just have to put up with it then
okay
So how are you doin
I'm I'm w- well , I'm all right
I'm okay , but , eh , you know , do you remember how I was feeling when I was in in and I just wanted to like quit the program , and I'm sick of it , and
yeah
I'm feeling that way again
oh no
So
yeah it's kind of
What do you , do y- you go through a , like a n- three monthly cycle or something
I I think that that something like that is true
when let's see what time of the year is i
I mean , hm
i- it's high summer
yeah
Well when I was in , when I was feeling really bad in it was like , like Marchish , righ
Mayb-
yeah
February
I don't know it seems like it's been so
Maybe maybe you should check out your , check out your biorhythms
ah okay
So how are you , how are things goin
um , oh Joseph , I don't know
It , I like what I'm doing but I am so isolated
And , this is , this is like the best present I've had the whole year I've been here
You're kiddin
Because I don't have anyone to talk to
oh , come on , you're kidding , righ
w-
No , I'm not kidding
It is so hard to talk to people here
You mean like , like Scottish folk
Then
well the br- just the British in general
I find them very , sort of , really reserved
And they , you know how Americans just kind of jump in and oh hi , let's be friends kind of thing
You know , we're stuck in the , in a horrible situation together , so let's laugh
uhhuh
And , and , the British don't jump in right away and , I mean
once they make friends with you , then they're nice to you
But , I don't know what the secret is of cracking the code
You know
So
uhhuh
And you haven't cracked it with anybody ye
Well , I mean , partly is I partly I'm so busy
ohgod , this course Joseph was so overwhelming this year
Wow
I mean , w- e- we were in class about six hours a day , and then you had to go home and do about twenty five hours worth of homework , to , to get ready for the next day Just , you know
No so like worse than Middlebury
oh , oh , worse , it was like , it was like as bad as Middlebury at its most intense , but i- it lasted all year , it wasn't over in nine weeks
ohmygod
I know I'm , I have so much gray hair
I mean ,
I must have ten times more gray hair than nine months ago
oh , no
You're going to look like a little old lady
It's incredible
It's just incredible
And then , we had our exams in June
and , so that part's all over with , and now I'm just doing dissertation stuff
so it's b- it's fun now
But um ,
Because you're sort of working on your own and self directe
yeah , well , I like , I there's , there's not so much daily pressure , you know , where you have to produce for everyda
huh
So it's it's a_lot better
And um , and Edinburgh is so beautiful
And right now there's all these festival things going on
And do you have time to go out and and see them , and enjoy the
Well I'm making time I'm I'm d- I'm doing something e- once a week for sure
e- e-
huh
you know So , eh the other day I took a bus trip up to the high- into the highlands and that was really good you know
And it's beauti-
uhhuh oh , that must be really great
It's beautiful here
It's it's really beautiful
And the and the weather is good right now
This is like a record or something
We've had all this sunshine and blue sky and it's been in the eighties , and
Wow
nobody can believe it
So , I guess I'm really lucky
What was it like in the winte
It was like being in the middle of a hurricane
No
I mean , the wind blows
You know , I'm not that small
I wouldn't say I'm a tiny woman
uhhuh
And the wind blows me into the hedge
You kno
I mean , it's like it comes off the North Sea and knocks you on your ass
Are you right on the wate
uh , really close
oh yeah
Can you swi
yeah
No
It's too cold
Really , really col
You'd be nuts if you went in
So nobody swim
No , there is a beach , actually , down the coast
There's a beach you can get to from here , but I haven't been there yet
hm
And so do people like sunbathe and
yeah
yeah
But they don't go in the wate
No they do
You can go in down there
It's a little bit on , it's a little bit d- south from here
uhhuh
and on the east coast , and you can get there easily from here by bus
hm
And people go there
But I haven't been there yet
hm
So are you going to get to
Anyway
going to get to stay a there a while after you're done with your program to like sightsee and stuf
Well , um , I I guess I'm just going to do mostly like one or two day things
You kno
uhhuh
And because it's so small and you can go all over on the bus
huh
And um , there's a student travel
um agency on campus and I can get sort of
uhhuh
student discount on things , you kno
mm
So I can go I can go away for a weekend , and it's not too expensive
Do you stay at like hostels and stuf
Well no , I mean actually , you know , B and B's or whatever
Reall
Not not too bad , yeah
So are there are other non- non Brits in the progra
There aren't any Brits in the program
There are six of us in my class
yeah
Myself and an Italian woman
oh oh she must be great fun
She's great , she's great
She's Sarda
She's wha
She's from Sardinia
oh
And um , and then the four guys are all Arab
There's the Sudanese and a Moroccan
uhhuh
And oh , and the Moroccan guy knows Hamunses by the way
It's a very small world
yeah , and um ,
and two Libyan guys
Reall
And that's it in my , in my year , in my class
It's a very
So have you been able to get close to the
Y- yeah , the guy the guys are really nice , you know , but we've had
so much work to do that you know we we don't really have much chance to
to s- you know spend a_lot_of time with each other But , um , but ,
m- Marie Antoinette and I are have become friends
uhhuh
So , and she's a_lot_of fun
She's very interesting , actually
I'll bet
She um , she was , she went across the Sahara desert by camel
She , her husband is a writer , his name is Michael Ascher
Michael wha
Ascher
Ascher , Ascher , I've never heard of him
And they , they got , when they got married , their honeymoon was a nine month trip across the Sahara desert
Ugh
They started , they started out in , I think they started out in Morocco and made their way down and all the all the way to um , through the Sudan
ohmygod
yeah
Can you imagin
yeah
oh yeah
I think she was the first um , the first European woman to do that
ohmygod
That must have been hellish
They wr- yeah they wrote , h- he wrote a book about it
hm
So
Is he America
No , he's br- he's English
uhhuh interesting so , her Arabic must be really good
It's pretty good
It's not any better than mine
Well , your Arabic is really good
It's it's a- it's gotten pretty good , actually
I've learned some interesting stuff here this year
Are you doing simultaneous stuf
No , we're not doing any simultaneous
Why no
Not at all Because , um , you ha- I think you have you have to , for one thing you have to be a_lot better at Arabic than I am to do it
But , um , mostly we're we spend most of our time on translation
hm
And , only a very little bit on interpreting
And the interpreting we do is , is a consecutive liaison interpreting
What does that mea
It means that , um , you , you , actually , it it well you you do it by paragraph
mhm
Small , small sort of small bits of speech
And , in some ways , it's harder than simultaneous
um , because , you have to not only remember what was said , but you have to get all the facts right , you kno
You ha-
Right , right
You've got to remember it all and
yeah , all the dates and amounts and , you know
So , there's a , there's a_lot_of practice in note taking , and devising your own sort of set of symbols that will jog your memory
mhm
you know because you can't , you can't keep notes on a whole paragraph of what somebody says
Right
You can't you just can't do it
wow very nice
it's really sweet
fast
yeah it is
wow
certainly is
so how's your family
yeah everybody is cool man I went home
How's your da
he's
it's not eh eh it's not eh it's not that serious
uhhuh
but let's just say he won't ever be eating salt as much as he used to before
right right
you know
and thank god he's never on those
uh I thought that was sugar
oh yes sorry sugar that's right
yeah
yeah you got to watch the sugar

it was the main part of the missing it was

at the class you know and I asked for them

me and you
we're in there for the long run Mike
We're in there for the long run
oh shit
did you talk to anybody else
uh
I spoke to I spoke to Jeff and Ang you know about a week ago

yeah
it's not far from Harrisburg it was another twenty five minutes
yeah
and I was like dude we already drove out like a hundred and ten miles
wow
why not you know

and it was just getting late we got to her place her father you know we had some conversation
uhhuh
we end up there for like three four hours
wow
before we went out we went out at like eleven o'clock you know
wow
um
I'm trying to think I was thinking of Blumlow
well that's cool
yeah he
I've been talking to him every couple days he's been calling me I call him and
um he's been working he's like a supervisor at Friendly's
okay
and he said he's making good money and
he's he's thinking of maybe even going into Restaurant Management
maybe going to Johnson and Johnson and Wales
uhhuh what's that a schoo
uh
yeah it's it's for
ye- she- she- like to be a chef
but
business shit
okay
and manage a ho- restaurants hotels
right
and I think it's in Rhode Island I think they also have one in Florida I think but
right
see he was thinking of maybe even going into that maybe
he's cu-
oh yeah over engineering
yeah well actually
um
when he left Temple he
oh he dropped it that's right
yeah he and he's eh now I think he's
He went undecided or something
if it all computer science I think
oh right right
and
so he's going to go another year to
U Mass
and you know then he'll he'll see what he wants to do from there
but I think he said he was going to go one more year and
I actually I just tried calling Moomoo
mhm
and his mom said he was at work
and I haven't talked to him in a while
and I'm trying to think who else
yeah I talked to Zophey tod- I didn't well I talked to his mother
he went to
yeah that's what he was that's what he was saying you talked to his mother
yeah
eh how's how's he doi- how's she
yeah I
or every anybody
we don't really associate there but
who
me and his mother or anything you know
oh really
yeah
why problem or no
no no it's just
just
she d- she never met me really you know
oh yeah yeah
did you speak to her
no I didn't speak Pakistani to her if that's
uh Salaam
Salaam
like the only word I know
right
ohgod
um
Tehida in hm
yeah
that's nice
who did he go Fra- I think he said he was going with Frank and all his buddies or whatever
oh really
I think that's what he said
oh I get yeah a place or something I don't know a hotel
what did she what did she say I don't know
oh she didn't tell me all she said he went to
went to and he'll be back on either Sunday or Tuesday or something I don't know
wow
he went for a while
yeah
before he was telling me he was going to Italy I was like oh shit
th- this Summer
yeah
huh
he was going to make a trip to Italy
With his uncles there's or s- or I don't know something
yeah that's what he said
he had some relative there or something he could
yeah
that's nice
oh
I have work
so he
he I spoke to him
probably it was probably last week it was about a week ago
and he said you know he's all on schedule for school and everything and
you know he's all
all hooked up
yeah he's not taking any organic with me or biology
he took A I H with us
yeah that's it
and
I don't I don't know I forgot what else he's taking
plus he can't even take that without Chem Two
yeah
and he didn't even take that this Summer
yeah
because originally it wa- i-
what he wo- what I gathered from him is he was going to go take it with me over at Temple
uhhuh
and then he's like I'm going to go to and take it over there it's closer to my house etcetera whatever
uhhuh
and he's never took it he just started working and everything else is alright
yeah
for a while there I think he said like he was
having some family problems
oh yeah
I think yeah
I think
he didn't go int- too into it with me but something with
right
like the money that they were receiving
right
like aid or something it got cut off because
uhhuh
from Temple
or not I I don't
sh- I didn't get
well from his dad see
I think I think maybe that I think because he turned eighteen
go ahead
right
oh okay right
or whenever he did turn eighteen
right right
right
I think that's when it was cut off
see he was saying that they were having a little li- like a little bit of problems but
I guess they got it straightened out or whatever
mhm
I don't know again he
dude I can only imagine I re- I feel real sorry for him
it's tough and I can
yeah
I don't know I I
you know it's like you got to you know like the Pakistani woman man
like she ain't no
you know this ain't this ain't a bad thing you know because my mom is the same way
yeah
she's not
from what I gather from what I'm assuming
from that one time I met her she's not very
uh
I don't want to say educated but doesn't know
the real life things you know
yeah
where are the deeds kept
where's the car ke- car stuff kept you know
yeah
bank account things like that
yeah
and to be honest with you my mom doesn't even know it
yeah
I know it though
my dad taught me all that stuff
uhhuh
I know where everything is
and
you know
yeah
I don't know if how close he was with his dad if he know if he knew all that stuff
yeah
Either which way you know just because I know doesn't mean shit you know that's a tough situation
yeah
that's hard to deal with you know
mhm
at eighteen or whatever he was sixteen that's tough you know
yeah
I know I ca- I know it's definitely really tough and
no questioning it
no questioning
yeah he
If I tried to put myself in that position man
sh
I'd lose it
yeah oh yeah
I wouldn't be in school
I don't I-
I'd be I'd be off for a while
oh yeah I'd be off too
It's tough
it's tough
hm
So how's everybody else your your sister your brother
yeah they're all fine
Possum is
is he how's he's his remember
his gonads are working good now
they're
little accident
the stitches are as the stitches are ge- are slowly coming out again
like they did they're supposed to fall off you know
He still has stitches there
right they they come out though you know
I mean it's been a while it's been months
It'll take
yeah it'll take six months before everything is totally healed
wow
and then he has another checkup with the
a surgeon
who did the surgery to check him out you know to make sure everything is cool
mhm
and like it wasn't
from what I understand from speaking to the doctor it wasn't life threatening
mhm
it was just that he couldn't reproduce you know if something serious happened
sh that sucks dude
and that would be you know for a
for a guy that hurts
yeah oh yeah
but that you know that's good
is is your s- or no that's that
dude did I tell you I got my bill
for what oh your hand
my hand
No what how much
twelve hundred bucks
Wha
twelve hundred bucks
eh does your insurance cover it
what happened was they sent me
like you know like I'm s-
like they were trying to justify by saying like i-
like let's say you have a problem Mike
mhm
the first thing you do like they have rules you know they don't just pay for everything they have rules you got to follow the rules
I think that must have been before I went on the riverboat
cruise they have a cruise on sunday nights
yeah
and they have
they get local bands to come on and they charge you ten dollars you know and
it was this one band that Dennis knows a lot of the people in it you know so he had
told me about it and so I went with him and some of his friends and
it was really nice it was really relaxing it was
kind of a a
more of a family atmosphere than going
you know
to a bar to listen to these people perform because they their families came
on the cruise for the most part you know they had their parents and their grandparents and their brothers and their sisters and their
nieces and nephews you know and
and other people brought their children to it
it starts
the boat leaves about seven and it's all over by about ten o'clock so it's not a late evening you know
mhm
and I like the music and
it was just
it's been so hot it's really pleasant to go out on the water
yeah
they had
the main
deck they had the air conditioning on
but later on
during a break I
went outside and just stood on the deck for a while and watched the sunset
and
you know felt the the breeze and everything and
it was just so peaceful it was like
one of those rare moments of pure serenity
mhm
it was really
pleasant
I really liked it
has it been real hot again since I left
since a week
it has been some days yesterday was bad
and
it hasn't rained a drop
actually I think it rained a little bit
way out in west Omaha
but not enough to really do anything you know
mhm
anyhow so that was fun I did that and
I enjoyed that a lot then
I worked all day saturday because I wanted to take some time off this
this week for my birthday just to try to catch up on the things that
I can't get done when I'm working and
because it's kind of nice to have some time to yourself you know
yeah
it's kind of a treat for me to be off on my birthday and
I've had a lot of work to do
and the only way I could really
get this week off was
you know to to work all day saturday
tell them that the project was ready to go and
I don't think there going to have any problems while I'm gone
I told my boss to call me if they did and I would come in but
I don't think he would call anyway he doesn't like to bother people when they've got time scheduled off
mhm
but I I really don't think they're going to have any problems he
he told me that
they
you know they were so concerned
they pushed my due date up a week they you know moved it advanced it a week
and then they wanted to push it up further
and I told them
it couldn't be done any quicker if they wanted it tested
so and you know he
backed me up on that he
figured they didn't really need it that soon anyway I think
and monday he told me that they really weren't ready to use it
after all that fuss and you know that they did
to
get it done
mhm
so anyhow
I don't care it's it's that's fine with me I'd just as soon that
I was waiting on them than I don't like to have them waiting on me you know
yeah
so I I'll go back to work friday
and
we'll see whether or not they've caught up a little bit or anything
and what else
I haven't been out to pick up the mail
because it's so hot I didn't want to go out
so I don't know if I got any birthday cards or not
well we just got our cards in the mail so
well I usually get interesting cards on my birthday from
uhhuh
you know people in other parts of the states
but so I usually kind of look forward to it but I have this weird thing on the back of my neck
And they still have just one daughte
Yes and I think that's probably all because I think Carl feels like people like me overpopulate the world
I have three sons now
Reall
yeah
gosh
And
uh All boy
Yes
No girls
ohmygosh oh that's so interesting and you know Jas- ah Jasmine and Sophie are taking swimming classes with Winston and I was
oh , are the
yeah , and I was thinking of asking him for your address and I thought no he's so forgetful he'll never remember
It's not worth it
Well he he never would or he he he wouldn't know how to you know he wouldn't know how to get it
I
I used to call him
Well , just just Winston I know you kno
I used to call him every once in a while but their niece like she's I think she's the oldest of all the
Reall
uhhuh
of all the kids the one whose I don't know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in Nicaragua fighting but anyway
No
she was living in the house and she's kind of
I don't know all I know I don't know if she would've been this way if she hadn't had all the problems she had in her life but she's kind_of a goofball and she ran up such big bills that I don't think they've had a phone for a whole year
because he can't pay them off but and I don't know if she's still living there or not
But I can give you my address yeah
Wow
huh
yeah I'd love I'd yeah
I'm so gla- you know how I have your numbe
I s- I
I was wondering about that
You talked to Dunya
No no well I did talk to Dunya but she didn't give well actually she wasn't there the day I called I talked to Ralph but um the last time I was in Honduras which is nearing two years
It's going to be two years in January
um I saw your husband I was as I was leaving the airport
and i- I had my billfold out and he wrote it on this little pad in my billfold and you know wha
I don't have a_lot_of things but I still have that
ohmygosh and I don't remember
So I thought well I'm going to advantage of it
So
ah and I don't remember him telling me that he saw you
oh he probably spaced it he was I think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something maybe where you
picking up people from Peace Corps probably yeah
Something like that yeah but that was right af- I mean that's a long time ago that was right after the the change of the government
We were down because of that
huh
So anyway
So three boys , Barb
yeah
Wow
My hands are so full
yeah I remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order
Well if I wanted to have a child I should do it you know and so that pushed me
He said that we don't want you to have a baby if it's going to create problems but if you want to have one this is the time and it actually
so you went all out
oh that's what it was
did turn everything around for me
I don't know if it works that way for everybody but those hormones
kind of took care of the problems I was having
I was starting to have the problem again befo- like it was only maybe three months afterwards I got pregnant but I could already feel the pains and all that so
Wow
I wa- I felt so good when I was pregnant I just felt like it was a miracle and then
Reall
oh yeah and then breast feeding those hormones also helped so I feel just fine
I hope I hope I never have to deal with endometriosis again but who knows after three
So your first boy is Joel or Noe
Noel Noel or Noel
Noel
And he's seven and a half
That's how long ago that was
We probably
uhhuh
Seven and a half
We haven't seen each other s-
yeah in a long time uhhuh
And your other two boy
Because
um Thomas is three
uhhu
It's Thomas Enrique is his full name
And then I have a baby who's just going to turn ten months
oh really
And what's the baby's nam
h- That's Logan Andres
ah
oh how nice
So are you going to keep goin
or
so
and you two girls
oh ah well , I r- I t- I thought I was done really after Thomas not that I think two is the perfect number but I didn't expect to get pregnant a third time I it just kind of that happened when I was in Honduras last time that was really so
mhm
i- I was so angry at Oscar that I just knew there was no way that I could ever even think of going to bed with him you know
So and that's when it happened but I love my little baby and /
huh
yeah
but
And you're still with Oscar right that's
well we're still married but he's doing his own thing like usual so I pretty much take care of the crew all alone
He calls to see how they're doing and
huh
pops in every once in a while , but it's tough
It really is and see his daughter lives here too
wow
she's
She doe
Well , she has since
well I think they've been here five years now , five years this summer because we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship
Both Oscar and Lehia um
He's twenty and she's just turned eighteen now
Wow
he doesn't live here um
He had kind of , well , so it's a long long story but at one point
when I got real irritated with Oscar everybody in the family insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his children which you know I really believed when I was there and I and i- I mean it does make a_lot_of
intellectual sense , I guess
But it really I didn't want to do that to the kids but I did and so I sent them to stay with him and then
I felt bad about it immediately and then he wouldn't let them come back and so it turned into a situation where Lehia was really the one that wanted to come back and Oscar junior kind of decided that living with his father was what he wanted
mhm
And Lehia's mom used to beg him to let her come back and he'd say yes and then he'd hang up the phone and he'd say I'd never let you go back there you know I mean it was real stupid
It wasn't really that he wanted her around but it was just it I don't know
People do stupid things
hm
oh
hm so they're living with hi
No , now how lon
Probably two years ago then we she and I worked it out where I got power of attorney from her mom because her mom always had custody and she called me one day when
there was nobody in the house but her and I drove and got her and kind of stole her back it was kind of exciting I couldn't believe that I'd ever do that but oh well it was very exciting actually because
ohmygosh
I mean I had to drive like two and half hours so we you know you didn't know at any moment somebody might be coming home
I said get your stuff ready and I called her when I got to the corner , you know , it was , it was really something and we just packed the car full
I mean there's wasn't one inch of space left and then we just flew out of there , and we went to the nearest McDonalds to kind of repack where we could breathe easy
ohmygosh
It was pretty funny and then you know he never said a thing about it
yeah he
hm
you know he'd I know that he knew she was better off here
and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once but you know he doesn't even know any of it because it's not that he doesn't care about his kids but he's not really capable of being a father
You know he just
hm
close
So what's Lehia doin
Is she studying or did she already graduate high schoo
She's going to be in her last year , of high school
uhhuh
And she's been with her mom for two months so she'll be coming back tomorrow
um
ah
so it's that's that's what we have here and then Oscar junior has in the last year he was he graduated one year ago from high school and he started going to school in Missouri and
then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to Omaha and go to school here which was really surprising and that he was kind of saying that it living with his father wasn't what he you know , he kind of had
his opinion on it has had changed , but they wanted to live in an apartment
They didn't want to burden me anymore were his words , but you know I know it's that they want they want freedom , which is great
They're twenty you know
hm
yeah
So they just moved in about oh four blocks well no maybe farther , about a mile from us they live
Wow
in an apartment and that's going to be really , I hope it's going to be nice
His buddy is here actually and Oscar is finishing some work that he was doing and then he's coming up sometime next week
yeah
but that that's kind of in a nutshell all the things that have been going on and
Wow
I
Well it's interesting
Are you working or are you teachin
oh yes
Well I don't teach I
yea
let's see , well I came back I I taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job in home ec which is it's probably still that way and I went for my masters in counseling
and
uhhuh
um
actually I was asked to come back and be the counselor at the American school and that was the year I was pregnant with Noel and I was really torn I didn't know what to do
but my doctor didn't want me to go back to Honduras because I'd been so sick before
He felt that y-
mhm
I really needed
We didn't know how the pregnancy was going to go but I I feel like I really I mean I wasn't really paying that much attention to what he said but that did influence a little bit
so I didn't go
hm
and uh , let's see , what would I , I guess I was working part time that year doing part time counseling jobs and then that next year I had two o- well I had one offer that I had to take
The other one was we were waiting for a principal to come back
mhm
but I ended up
I wanted to go into high school counseling but I couldn't because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he c- had to make the decision it's like oh
I need th- I need this need to know fast because I'm pregnant and I cannot , you know , risk losing a job
So I ended up working at the
Sure
community college which wasn't what I wanted at the time but a- as it's turned out it probably was the best and I like it real well
I l- I was cou- I counseled for about five years and now I'm in administration
oh great
really
yeah raining and thunderstorms and stuff like that
oh gosh it is blistering down here just so hot
so
it's been hotter than the dickens but it it's been and we've been having severe thunderstorms and tornadoes all over the place
oh really
yeah
any by you
um well we had a really bad thunderstorm come through I want to say Thurs- Thursday night maybe
mhm
it was just awful I mean there was trees down there was branches all over there's still and the roads are just
cluttered with debris branches and
oh wow
you know
stuff
but I don't know I think it might have been a twister that maybe just didn't touch all the way down
mhm
or something
but
we didn't have any trees so we don't didn't lose anything
so that's okay
Did you get those trees taken out
yeah we did yeah
ha breathes the word
oh let's see four of them was it
yeah I think four
so
and we got one tree left over by the garbage can
oh yeah
yeah so you got to leave one you know
yeah
yeah
well you know what you'll get some new trees eventually and
yeah
they'll grow
oh yeah well we have those two little
little ones out front you know
that's right and they'll grow
yeah
they'll grow
yeah
we've stopped by grandma did you get my postcard
yeah I just got it today in the mail
oh good

um yeah well we picked it up today so
well sometime while you were gone
yeah it could've been Saturday or

So it's not a big house it's a smaller house but anyway

yeah it was fun
I haven't been up there

huge pieces I think the pie was probably cut in six
oh my
you know
wow
or even five
huge pieces
uy yuy
wow
so anyway that was fun
I don't know if I've ever been to Christopher's you know
we went once with gran- mom and dad
okay maybe we did
I think once but eh you know only like once
yeah
so how long are you guys at Island
we were there one day
yeah
yeah we didn't stay over night there we we camped in
in
we went across the streets
uhhuh
and there's a state park right across there
oh
it's right on Lake Huron
oh really
right next to the bridge exactly next to the bridge
oh wow
anyway so we camped there
oh that's nice
we went to Island the next day we went to Gram and Gramp
we left you know we left harbor and drove up and stopped at by Gram and Grandpa's and stuff
uhhuh
went across the bridge and stayed th- in the UP that night
then the next day we went over to Island
okay
from there
huh
and then stayed at street's again that night
oh fun
so yeah
okay did you go up to the fork whatever
yeah we did
yeah
yeah we did we did
we we didn't take the ha- the carriage right around
wait now
that's really expensive
is it
yeah like eleven fifty a person or something
oh my
and the ferry was eleven fifty
uhhuh
and tickets in the fort were six fifty so it's like
you're kidding
so we didn't do that
oh yeah you would of yeah
we rented a bike for an hour
oh well that's good
a tandem
oh really
it was a disastrous bike it was a horrible bike
oh really
but anyway we had fun anyway
the person in the front did all of the work basically
I know
that person behind was there for the ride
oh I know good
So going uphill was just
oh horrendous huh
you know
oh no
but anyway we had fun
so did Johnny stay in fron
Johnny was basically in front I tried being in front for a little while but I didn't make it very far
that's funny oh well
that's what the guys are for right
eh yeah
so anyway but the hills you know I mean there's a road going around the island it's flat
uhhuh
so that was fine
wow
but then we we we only wanted to to do an hour
you know because otherwise it costs costs more
sure
so then we had to cut across the middle of the island which means of course you have to go up
oh sure
but anyway
oh well that's good
we had fun
we bought fudge
yeah let's see ooh yum not not the ones that were in the picture though huh
oh yeah no yeah that's the card I sent you
yeah ride those or whatever
yeah
that's cute oh dear
ah yeah
yeah what a riot
so that
So how long were you guys g- up there
well we were at harbor for about a week
uhhuh
yeah we went to harbored on one on Sunday and then we left there on Sunday morning
okay
and then
so we were basically we drove all day Su- well we didn't drive all day Sunday we got up there on Sunday
uhhuh
if I count Sunday
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
yeah
and then Friday we saw a thing or two and came back
okay oh fun
that's a nice little vacation
yeah it was great vacation
cool
It was nice we were originally planning to stay one more day like through Friday
oh yeah
come back on Saturday
yeah
but we had seen enough
yeah
of the area
and actually we were kind of ready to come home
yeah it's kind of you get home a little earl-
all the clothes were dirty
yeah
the flies were just horrible biting
oh really
yeah
but we swam in swam in Lake Michigan
how about
Lake Huron and Lake Superior
not Bertland
no because
only because you know
the public beach is kind of hard to find
oh really
I mean I didn't I didn't know where it was
we had never been to the public beach because we always went to the pastor's or whatever his name was
didn't we
oh that's right I forgot didn't we
wasn't that the pastor
I think so
or his friends or something so- somebody from the church
yeah that's right
hm anyway
yeah
oh well
yeah
so
mhm that's cool
anyway nobody did swimming but like but we think we might go back some time
that would be nice
yeah
well
yeah
well I sent yo- I set something with Joanna for you
oh you did
yes in memory of the garden that we attempted to plant
oh what was it
cucumbers
oh did you make its hummus here
yes
thanks
got whole patch of little cucumbers and I have green beans and I'm going to be getting squash and I just got a couple tomatoes
oh excellent
yes so I sent you some cucumbers
oh thanks that's really great
yeah hopefully you like cucumbers still
oh yes we do I do
good
yes
so
yay that's nice
one one of the larger ones might have a few
a couple little bite marks in it because Bethany was carrying it around thinking it was a melon and taking some
attempting to take some bites off of it
she thought it was a melon
yeah
she had it and she goes melon melon she's walking around and
she'd take a little bite out of it and make a funny face and then go mm melon
is she in bed
yeah
yeah
she was so tired today she went to bed at she went to sleep at seven fifteen
you're kidding
no I just hope she doesn't wake up at some
hour in the morning
no kidding
but she does I I guess I'll get up
wow
oh
he was really tired though
yeah
but we got to bed pretty late
but was she good
yeah she was very good I I think she's cutting some more teeth so she's been
not crabby but
uhhuh
just
chewing on things and just a little bit
there's nothing that it's like someone smoking or any other addiction
that
the
addict has to be willing and and want to give it up
but I mean it wasn't like we ever showed up at their house or they showed up at our house and he was drunk you know
right
he wasn't
right
he acted normal he always acted normal when he left
mhm
no it wasn't like he was falling over
right
you know like Mike's friend Jimmy
it was obvious
hm
yeah
he couldn't handle his liquor you know and
it was obvious
right
from the beginning and he you know
he drank
ten beers at a shot
yeah
well there are some alcoholics who are able to conceal it better than others who
you know
takes more to affect them
so that it's obvious to others
hm
oh it explains a_lot_of the odd behavior
eh you know like Jane would say that
he he took a_lot_of sick days
mhm
and
she sai- i-
I don't know
you know it's just like I can't understand why she never told me
all this time
well that's that's something that's very hard to share with anybody and it's the kind of thing you really
oh we're such close friends though but I mean you know up until
yeah
two months ago we're still going over each others we just didn't do it much this summer
mhm
but you know we'd go to their house and they'd open up a bottle of wine
mhm
you know why continue if they're going to Alcohols Anonymous for five years
yeah
why do that with close friends
right then don't serve it sure
or don't serve it or
say you know I'm not we would've sort of gotten the clue
mhm mhm
after a while when they didn't want to drink any wine at our house or
sure
you know he didn't have to say it
but why continue serving it at dinner
right
yeah that's just a part
to everybody
right
you know
right that's a strange thing that they continue to serve it and
you know
you know Kim_Joy_Humphries eh what became an alcoholic
and the last time he came to our house
as they walked in she walked in first and Berl stopped me at the door he said
don't serve any li- any liquor
don't even offer it
yeah
so you know that
yeah
I mean we're
friendly with Jimmy and we don't drink around him
right
you know we don't have anything he doesn't have anything
mhm
mhm
why tempt him you know we're not going to sit here and have a beer in front of him he can't drink
yeah
sure
right right
why wouldn't they
tell us to try to help them with this pro- you know
yeah
who knows but
I don't know
that they're I guess they f- probably felt it was a terrible
shame and disgrace and maybe it was just
but that's foolish because you certainly should
share these things with your friends so that they can help you with it rather than
continue to
use it and abuse it you know
ha
I'm sorry to hear that
I hope certainly hope he'll make it
but said you know like he used to take sick days all the time
mhm
he he's been doing this f- forever
yeah
and
she said oh he seems to catch everything the kids get
mhm
I mean whatever she didn't realize that he was
yeah
you know
honey
wha- you just deny it to yourself too
but
yeah I mean I was up there last week with her
in New Hampshire
mhm
and it's she said you know I've been counting up the number of sick days that Gary has taken since the beginning of the year he's taken twelve sick days
mm
and he always took sick days when she was working and the kids were at day care
mhm
mm
and I you know I'm thinking to myself gee he must really need
a break
yeah
you know maybe he just wants the house to himself and can't tolerate
mhm
you know
having to go to work and always have people around having to be home and always have p- you know maybe he just needs days
mhm
to himself maybe this is just too much
you know three kids is too much for him or something I'm thinking i-
right
family stress I didn't think it was
mhm
because he was drinking or hung over or
right
whatever
right
yeah that
it's not the kind of thing that pops into y- into your mind as as being a fairly common
although I'm sure it's much more common
than what
we all know
but
it isn't the first thing that you think about when you hear about someone
taking sick days you think they're sick
mm
oh she always used to complain that he worked till nine o'clock at night and Mike and I used to say boy he you know
mhm
what's going on that he can't manage his work load
mhm
you know if he's there from ni- how can anyone work from nine in the morning till nine at night five days a week
mhm yeah
and get home at ten o'clock we're like you know
right
obviously
either can't manage his work load or
mhm
you know we just couldn't understand it
yeah
but
he was probably going
he was probably going out drinking
to a bar
yeah
yeah
so maybe she didn't know
mhm
you know
right
I mean she knew enough to know he was an alcoholic and to
have him get help
mhm
and to go to Al- and she said you know lately it's gotten so bad that he was
seeing one on one a
therapist
mhm
but
I don't know it's they said the next forty eight hours is critical
oh dear that's really a shame
oh we're just hoping he makes it through
sure
sure
is he around your age
or is he older
yeah thirty nine
mm
yeah that's really rough
yeah
sorry to hear that
it's not like he's Mickey Mantle on sixty three
well
hm
yeah
you know
yeah
well but
it's no good at any age no matter what
no
you know some people catch it up with the earlier I suppose
huh
anyway how was your trip home last night okay
yeah
yesterday afternoon
it was fine both of the kids were sleeping when we we- went by exit twelve
oh
oh
phew
we ended up at actually a really good place called the Blue Colony Diner
oh yeah exit ten
oh yeah we've been there
yeah
yeah
mhm
uhhuh because they were both awake and
yeah
yeah
we've stopped there
yeah
mhm
it was good
yeah
oh because
it used to be very good
uh we we used to stop there all the all the time on the way up to Jen's
and then a couple times
we tried it
and
the service wasn't too great and some of the things we ordered were just not
particularly good so we
stopped going there but
oh
oh I guess it's better
again
Well it was jam packed
mhm
and they were moving people in and out
yeah
and the waitress came and I'm kind of looking around thinking gee this is going to be
mhm
you know
yeah
she came
I said to Mike we better order when she first gets here
right
because we're not going to see her again
she came two minutes later she brought the drinks back
uhhuh
like within ten minutes she had our dinners our lunches there
mhm
oh good
so
yeah
that was good and
I had a Reuben
uhhuh
which was a little bit greasy
uhhuh
right
it was good
yeah
and Mike had
I don't remember what he had but it was good too
mhm good
good well we'll have to try it again then
if we're in the vicinity
yeah
yeah
try
How was Danny's thing
so
It was nice
oh it was very nice
very nice
uh
we got there
oh a few minutes after twelve and they
first they served
sh- platters of shrimp
shrimp cocktail
and they kept replenishing them which was very nice
and cheese and
crackers
and the dip
and a dip
with veggies
and then they had
lunch they served lunch about oh one thirty or two o'clock maybe
mhm
and
yeah they had a chicken
uh
the little red potatoes and
green beans and carrots and
salad
salad
and then they had
they had eh
the congratulations cake for
Danny and Julie and they there were also three people celebrating anniversaries in in Anne's family so she had three
separate little cakes for them too
mhm
and so it was very nice we had
very nice time
the crowd
yeah yeah she
oh how many people were there
uh
mm
hundred
oh wow
you think
ten tables I think
and eight around a table well eh between eighty and a hundred yeah
yeah
huh
mhm
Did you know the people you were with
guess
yes
um we were with
well
Debra Nells David Nells
uh you know is
mhm
our f- our physician
he was supposed to come but he apparently had an emergency up at the hospital
oh
and he never made it
and
two other Jerry Kesselman
uh his wife was is away and
um
I don't think you know Bob Markwardt anyway his wife also was away so they were there and
um Freddie's brother Sandy
mhm
and Phyllis his wife Phyllis were there at our table
oh
so yeah it was very nice
we met a_lot_of other people we hadn't seen in a while it was
uh
it was very pleasant
was Suzanne there
no
no
she probably will come in for the wedding but she's out in California now
When is the wedding
March
oh
uh
and she's only been there
you know couple months so
yeah
when you start a new job you can't really
take that much time to go back and forth
right
especially f- you know
uh
a wedding they would but
just the
engagement party
and unfortunately Ruth Mandel was in the hospital
She gave me actually not the eh the not a hundred and twenty days
She g- I got it she what do you call it what do you she first class mail whatever you call it
Registered whatever yeah
or yeah and eh it was never it was like two weeks ago and I'm supposed to have like a hundred and twenty days and I only have sixty days and that's not really fair and
oh I didn't yeah I didn't realize that there was a that there was a I mean because I've always had trouble with my landlords so I've never I mean so I've always been sort of aware that whenever I've left that there's that anxiety and you probably when you left
first of all you didn't know you were going to stay there
yeah exactly
second of all you know it's like it all sort of like ends up I can understand that I can I can underst- because that makes you feel like you're making a choice that
yeah
It's like a a c- a yeah a big cut and everything and I mean I I don't know if it's worth kee- I mean I'm like okay the maybe I'll then I'll never be able to go back you know but I'll
yeah
But that's not true
yeah
that you wouldn't ever be able to go back because you know that you know w- as
Others possibilities
y- you know
you could find another place to live I mean people are still finding like you know I know of people that are still finding like lofts in Brooklyn w- in Williamsburg that are like cheaper that would be the kind of thing that you might want to change your living situation anyhow
And I don't think
I'm still yeah
yeah eh eh eh yeah it's just letting go I have problems letting I mean I've had it for so long you know I've lived there
yeah no I know
but it's yeah I don't think it's that w- you know it's worth h- I mean I don't I you know a week before I'm saying thinking to myself well if I ever move back to Man- you know the c- New York I don't want to live in Brooklyn anymore
oh right right
and so I then I you know this power of thought thing but otherwise I'm you know I'm okay I just I think I need some sort of
change or something I need a cha- you know either I'm bored uh you know with what I'm doing not with what I'm doing so much with art but with my life that I need some sort of
I need to have some you know physical change or visual change because it's you know I need I've just been working and um
Are you still doing like the set painting to make mone
yeah I it's been great but I I didn't get I thought I'd have more work this month than I did and so I don't have as much as I would thought I would have because I really want to buy
a laptop and I need it really badly it's like ridiculous now I mean I'm doing all this writing and I go you know to different people's houses and it's this yeah it would be I mean it's a luxury definitely but it's I definitely could use it
Well it's a tool it's a tool yeah
yeah it's a great tool
And how are yo
How
um
How you doing Gai
Wait wait wait let's get caught up on you first
I mean
what's so what's going on with Ren
Rene's great Rene's good he's he's coming with me also and he's going to
When are you comin
um we're coming on the thirtieth of August
Of August for how lon
Three weeks I'm going to be staying with family and stuff like that
Are you going to be in New_Yor
oh yeah
We're not no I'm I'm the fi- I won't be in New_York until
You said we're we
um no I said I won't be in New_York
Is there a w
oh oh I thought you said
No there's not a we but I'll tell you about that in a minute
oh
You're not going to be in New_York aw come to New_York
um I'm not going to be in New_York until October and
uhhuh
uh so that's yeah so that
How's the gig out ther
Well okay it's m- it's mixed i- no i- yeah and no it's good it's bad it's it's weird it's it's definitely like first of all um
is it weird
like I came I've been out here for about six weeks now
It's taking me a while to settle in
it's definitely like
Hot
oh man it's horrible it's so disgusting and
I mean I hear weather reports for there I'm like oh gee
I know and I wake up in the morning and it's overcast and the sun doesn't shine
The thing is in New_York city it might be hot but at least like the sun is shining or you'll get like those big
yeah
those big city breezes like coming in off the water you know what I mean
Those big city bre- yes I do you get some
You know what I mean right and here like the air doesn't even move like you're so lucky and then eh it moves like th- there'll be a thunderstorm in the afternoon
And everybody runs out to try to get some air
and it's like and then it's gone and then it's like it's the the the oppression is there again yeah exactly and it's like all this steam rising off the ground
oh hotter
but okay so I don't like the weather and I think that I feel like I'm in the suburbs because I don't have a car and I feel like I need a car to get around to the places that I need to get to because eh
things are so sort of scattered around they're like it's like being like at McDowell but without the but without the you know the fact that like somebody goes on a daily basis into town or you know those kind of things it's it's definitely like a
yeah sure of course
ohgod
yeah sure
Can't you get a really cheap on
Well I'm thinking
Like a bunch of yeah a group of yo
yeah yeah I'm thinking about getting a junk mobile
I was thinking about g- I wanted to get like a ca- like a real like something that I could have for a couple of years or something like that
That would be great
and I've been looking around and I haven't really seen anything oh excuse me
I've gotten into this bad habit of remember when I was an undergrad and I used to watch Star Trek reruns
and the Twilight Zone
oh really your watching
I'm watching Star Trek reruns at midnight because there's this
That's great
guy that that that I've gotten to be friends with or a couple of people that I've gotten to be friends with actually they watch Star Trek at midnight like reruns all the time
Not the Next Generation though
um
You're not into that
Star Trek the it is well it's the one with Captain Picard
mm
I don't know which one that is
That's the yeah that's the earlier one
I like the new one Next Generation that's pretty cool you should look into it
uhhuh
Anyway
You're so bad Anyway so so that's why I'm yawning but anyway what was I going to say
so it took me a while to settle in because and i- and I'm still not totally settled in
I've started to do s- some work
I did the first month that I was here I took a class in digital music which is like electronic you know like music editing and stuff like that
oh cool
mhm
oh that's great
And because I've been w- you know working with sound and I'm interested in working more with sound and stuff and so that was really good we there was a concert at the end of it and I felt
that's great
pretty good about my contribution to that like it wasn't really exactly what I would want but I felt like like I
oh that's great
yeah so that was g- that was good that was something that you know like y- being here gave me access to
I'm also learning a_lot about computers like
like about other things about computers like about you know how to do email and how to do like
Email's interesting
networking yeah yeah I mean if you get if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have
I may have to
well I mean like I have a lapt- I have a an email address
I don't know who else that you know has an email address but it's the kind of thing that I would like I'm trying to t-
You can get contact with people easy
yeah I'm trying to like tell people because it only costs like a local phone call like if you if you call New_York I mean if you wanted to write to somebody in New_York you could like you could like type it up
It's like a eh a fax thing
yeah it's but it's better it's even cheaper than a fax I think because it's
yeah and it it goes into the computer it's not like with paper
Right it's not with paper but it's and it's cheaper because it's c- it's the cost of a local phone call whereas a fax takes the amount of time that the that the phone call
oh that's great
No it's really great and then you can get access to all any as any information you really need I mean if you needed something about research or whatever you
Right right yeah
This is amazing to me
yeah so yeah like the internet and all that kind of stuff so that's that's like so I'm learning about that so that's kind of cool and then
That's great
and I'm supposed to start teaching in September
I mean I'm a little bit nervous about that because I have to still put together a s- like a course syllabus and
Joan get to work it's two weeks away
what
I know
I know
I know
We could talk about email and stuff like that
No I'm joking with you but that that's okay I'm just joking but
uhhuh okay you know what listen hold on one second you know what I have to go to the bathroom hold on one second okay
All right
Can you bring the phone No
hu
Say wha
Bring the phone
I can't bring the phone into the bathroom
No it's too it doesn't stretch hold on
Hi so
Hi who's paying for this call
The University of Pennsylvania
oh fanta- ah America
So anyway so well yeah it's like I I I am a little ner- I mean the thing is I've never taught a class
well that's not true
I taught the same class in Germany but it was different
yeah what about upstate New_York you did it you teach
That was teaching I was teaching three D design which is really different because that was freshmen these are like graduate students I think
oh really oh that's well that's that's intense well how many how often do you see them
I teach twice it's twice a week for th- we meet for three hours and so anyway so that's going on so
That's great though
but I mean it's good it's weird like I've been having you know the thing about you're s- saying like about you know like giving up the apartment in New_York and those kinds of things I mean I've been thinking about those kinds of things again also
yeah
because you know I think to myself like you know I could make life easier for myself I could come to Berlin I could probably like you know make a you know you know get the paperwork in order and make a way
very easily
Not not really very far and it's it's a you know it's a question of having a few solid days to work on it you know which I just haven't had I mean
Well I mean is it too much to ask you to just take just come up to Windsor and finish it after you get back
Well we've got to l- we've got to move and we've got to and I've got to do my classes but so probably you know but you know I'm not te- I'm only teaching I think one class so I'll have
I just would feel better if you had it done before you turned up at the department
I mean you're coming back the thirty first you don't start teaching until whe
Like the fifth or sixth I mean
ach
yeah
Lord
yeah no it's it's n- yeah I th-
I don't I don't you know I I don't think it's going to be a big deal I really kind of st- doubt that Michelle will /
will be ready to go you know she was already talking about sort of middle of September
um in the beginning of the spring
ohgod
yeah but she's c- she couldn't she's got more leeway than you I think
yeah but I've got so much more going for me than she does
I know
You know in the in the larger scheme
If they don't tenure you we'll sue them
We won't sue them but no anyway so
It'll work out but anyway I'm I'm so I'm I I mean I caught myself today just getting a little sort of
Edgy
yeah
Well look
But but
If you change your mind and you want to just come right up to Windsor and finesse the move we can do that
No
No I don't want to do that
I don't want to do that
It'll because I it'll be better to do the move right away anyway because I'm I you know I can't come home and go right to work I just can't do that
You'll be exhausted yeah
yeah and I won't want to do it
I won't be able to concentrate
Right whereas we can do things
Whereas spending together time together
and moving and settling in
while moving is is fine
yeah
yeah
All right well
I g- I guess we'll have to figure out our respective movements when when it gets closer but I'm going to Ashfield with Greg
uhhuh
tomorrow
uhhuh
And
Stay up ther
Well Greg and Jim Jimco and the kids are leaving for Japan tomorrow
uhhuh
and
uh Greg's going to go up on a hiking trip with a friend
uhhuh
but he's going to
stop by Ashfield to drop off the dogs
uhhuh
So he can take me and the baby up
uhhuh
and then I'll maybe come back down with him he's coming back down I guess ten days later
uhhuh
I mean he's not staying the whole time but he'll come back the last weekend of the month I think they said
uhhuh
and then go back down to New_York and he can probably take us then because it's gotten to be I just moving on my own is just very very difficult
No stay up there
um well and I'm going to try and get back to work on my paper which is just ridiculous but
yeah
uhhuh
I'm going to make an effort
Well we can both make an effort you know you can I'll finish my book you finish your paper you know
yeah
if you if you haven't already
Although you know Cuny classes start really early
uhhuh yeah but then don't you have all those holidays right at the beginnin
That's true
That's a good point
I should really use those shouldn't
yeah
I haven't lone lined up any child care yet I'm being really flaky about it and I know I'm going to hate myself later
You know I really ought to take the semester off
but did I tell you this is the last year of the
i- is that for sur
It's not for sure yet but
uhhuh
um but they've sent Cuny a letter
uhhuh
saying that the President did not
ask for funding for it in his budget
uhhuh
and it looks quite doubtful that the Senate is going to want to put it back in
uhhuh
um
so that Cuny thinks that this is the last year of it so I'm reluctant to take a semester off
uhhuh
considering that it that I would only then have one semester left
Well anyway t- you know this is not going I mean apart from the tenure and the book
you know this is not going to be a killing term for me
I'm only teaching one class
and I've taught it before
uhhuh
so you know and and I and I
Well once your tenure file goes in I'll be ready to believe that but until you get it in I I don't think you should have I think you should have
you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together
Obvious
That's like critical for us
yeah yeah
So I don't want you to fee- I don't want you to take on a a_lot_of extra stuff at the beginning because
well I
it doesn't make sense
yeah
w- believe me dear once you have tenure I will have no mercy
Good good
Especially because you're going to be away every summer you're really going to have to do a_lot_of
yeah
you're going to have to take a_lot_of responsibility during the year to make me feel like things are at all equal
Right
But not this not immediately this semester just because
okay
you that you know you've you've got a child now
That's right
You've got to get tenure
That's right
So what was it what was your trip in what was the time in New Mexico lik
So
ohgod it was horrible
Reall
It was horrible
Wh
I can't i- I was so tense and the baby was so unhappy
because because you were tense
and I think she just
I think that's what it is
yeah sure
because the minute I got here I relaxed completely and she's been just an angel
yeah but I mean that that makes perfect sense
yeah I know it does
Like dogs
yeah
yeah
It was awful th- w- you know we may get cut off at some moment so
uhhuh
if we do you know I'll I'll call you when I get to Ashfield
okay
um
it was just awful they I was stuck up on that hill they only had the Legend
uhhuh
and I had I they kept telling me I didn't need to rent a car which I absolutely did
uhhuh
um so anyway I didn't have my own transportation
uhhuh
They were buying a house
They have now bought a house
So they were just out driving around all day
They were completely stressed out
They had finished looking by the time I had got there but they were debating they were making a- trying to make an offer
uhhuh
and Alexis you know has no confidence about this
uhhuh
and he had the most ridiculous realtor you've ever seen
uhhuh
um and he hates owning property and he and he could only buy a house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was /
0
about half of what he wanted to spend
and he was a wreck
uhhuh
and then Joel showed up
uhhuh
Jemma was there and mom was picking on Jemma like she always does even though Jemma's a doll
uhhuh
Joel then turned up the day after I arrived and drove us mad
Drove us crazy
He was more obnoxious than he's ever been
uhhuh how do you kno
You haven't seen him in ages
Well Jemma said so
I think I have greater tolerance for Joel than anyone in your family does
I think you do
I think you do but he really was he really was a pain in the neck and Jemma said it's because his girlfriend just dumped him
uhhuh uhhuh
um but anyway so mom and Alexis were freaking out because of that but they have no ability to set any limits you know
So like they can't say to Joel look
you know go away for a while or I mean she couldn't say to Judith no they can't come that week
uhhuh
you know and th- and we were supposed to go out to dinner one night and they showed up unexpectedly
They were supposed to be out
They had gone to the Grand Canyon , and didn't expect them back
uhhuh
And they showed up unexpectedly and you know they mom and Alexis couldn't could not bring themselves to say we're taking Claire out to a nice dinner
uhhuh
see you later this is our only evening with her
yeah
you know we want to have some time with her
They couldn't bring themselves to say that but they were so upset that he'd come back that they that the evening was just like a complete it was painful
Good
And we went to a different restaurant a cheap restaurant I mean it was it was just painful and I j- I felt so pissed off because
you know there I was expecting a family vacation
I mean it's not so much Joel I mean oh well anyway yeah
I mean it was supposed to be a family vacation
yeah
and it was like it was like so stressful I mean I don't know why I didn't know why I had bothered to go
yeah
And then you know Eve Eve and Seth were down in their house and mom's all of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting Eve from too many distractions
uhhuh
because Eve had to work
yeah
So you know there was you couldn't go to Eve's house or you couldn't you couldn't ask Eve to have Joel and Jemma for a night
uhhuh
although she was perfectly capable of having Guy and Jenny for a night
uhhuh
I was furious
And then Guy came and he was kind_of a jerk you know
He was kind of harsh with me and
you know just sort of not very sensitive and didn't want to help with Joel and Jemma at all
We finally made him take them out for an afternoon
I mean it was all just in
you know just ridiculous
And it and it wasn't so great with Eve either
She she said she wanted to spend a day with me
uhhuh
so I set aside this so I w- you know I set aside the day she told me
uhhuh
and it what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with her
uhhuh
and sitting there while she talked to her hairdresser for an hour and a half
and then going out to lunch with her and her babysitter
uhhuh
Who brought the baby to meet us
and I thought that the reason the babysitter was staying for lunch was because she would then take the baby away again
Right
But at the end of lunch , Eve just told her to go home
uhhuh
So we'd have this we'd have this two hour lunch with the babysitter
uhhuh
and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops and that was the end of the day
And it was like
I mean it was almost if she was protecting herself from spending time with me
yeah
It was really weird
um and then they wanted to borrow the Baby Bjorn for their ha- they're taking Emma on a they're on a camping trip right now with the baby
uhhuh
and I got kind of peeved and I decided I wasn't going to lend it to them
Well y- I mean
I just didn't want to ,
Well anyway you use it , righ
Well I I I haven't used it on Long Island although I did think I was going to
Well but I mean what they were going to take it and then mail it back to you or
yeah yeah but I was like forget it I'm going to lend this thing to
No that's insane
No they they they can go fucking spend some of their own money for a change
Unbelievable
yeah things are going things are g- eh eh thank God really very very happy
Very nice
great
What's what's what's with yo
uh , let's see , well I'm han- still hanging out at Westinghouse
yeah
I have your hat
I wear your hat all the time
oh goo- I thought you you know it's a good hat man
I I sent that to you with all good intents
I hope you appreciate it
I do
I wear it all the time
okay
I even have a p- uh I I hope I have a picture
of myself when I had reserves the other day
you know th- th- the other month
uhhuh
I took a picture with me and I had hope it comes out
I'll send it to you
thankyou very much
um
If it doesn't I'll take another picture
Let's see
Go ahead
Well I'm still working there you know and I got a I'm on a pretty good project
Right
A long a long term next generation fighter plane
Reall
So that's kind of good experience I guess
uhhuh
And Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the C B S broadcasting network
I thought they bought them already
Well , you know , th- it's takes months to close a deal so there's lots of spec- /
ah
lots of speculation /
Right
that they'll have to sell the
electronics division in order to do that
And wh- wh- and what would happen with yo
I guess we'd be sold to another company and see what happens
I don't know
mhm
I'm not too concerned about it though but
it's a possibility
But
Have you have you y- have a senior position there
Well , I suppose so
But , you know
They don't really think of it that way they look they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have
It's just a business
Right
they just
get rid of what they don't want
uhhuh
But that's that's still going pretty well
huh
nothing really new with the h-
house or anything
we've had some interesting incidents with wasps
that have
been invading the neighborhood
They started they they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through
But I told you about that , I think
I got a in the in the mail
yeah
So that
Well I wanted to ask you wha- what's what's with the schoo
The schools are extremely expensive
I'm going broke basically doing that
And I don't know how to handle that
But how come th- how come how come they don't help yo
It doesn't make a difference
They're only going to you're still going to go broke whether they help you or not
They're not going to let you run a p- run a run a profit
when you're on scholarship
If you if you have t- two thousand dollars at the end of the year they're not going to say oh well I guess you can have that
They're going to make you pay everything
Wait a minute I'm talking about wait wait fir- I'm talking about yo- your schooling
My schoolin
I thought you meant the kids' school
My schoolin
yeah
I don't know
I put it on hold all the time
took a course last semester I I haven't signed up yet for the fall
It's a_lot_of stress
It's a_lot_of stress
Taking to trying to you know you put out a_lot_of money and you have to
work really hard to get it back
Right
And there's not necessarily any benefit to it either
So
hm
I was talking abou- I was sorry I was talking about the kids' school
Right the ki- the kids
yeah R J told me how much /
yeah
it costs
But meanwhile /
it's a_lot_of money
she doesn't know how much you pay
I don't know why that is
I think what we pay
um mm we have to
books
for all the k- all the kids
cost us
uh
for for for for two kids it cost about a six hundred sh- about two hundred dollars apiece
uhhu
And then for
the taxes and everything else abo-
maybe if it i- c- if i- if it costs a year
um maybe
seven hundred dollars a a a kid
okay
That's total everything
Pretty much
yeah
Pretty much
So we're paying about eight times that
No about four about five times that
yeah
five times that
No , actually , ah we're paying six times that
I'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid
uh
Or more
Right
Right
But then you could also loo- loo- look into the other part
The the tax bracket
yeah
Here f- here f-
yeah forty five
forty five , actually
with all the other taxes that are going on here
the first job
uh
i-
i-
I pay forty five percent /
mhm
my salary
It goes to taxes
And then with my a- all the mo- all all of my second job ,
it already comes out to fifty five percent of that
mm mm mm
Plus the taxes
Unbelievable
that's incredible
That's why I I got the I remember I got th- the first paycheck
yeah I pretty much knew that's what the statistics were
Right
As soon as you you get yo-
y- you get you get the paycheck and
you see the
before tax
income and you say wow fi- like f-
finally you're able to get up to
a decent number
and then you look at th- th- the bottom and and you say what is this
You put it into your y- your little pocket calculator /
you say they're taking f- taking fifty five percent says fifty five percent
I say what country /
in their right mind takes fif- what about the encouragement eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more
They they don't care
But you still like it ther
Fifty-five
But yo-
yeah , because you're able
You're still
h
It's great
It's great
We enjoy it
The kids are happy
Having a wonderful time
yeah
And
It's still , even with all the
political nonsense that goes on here
you still feel that we're building
building the place in a very small
small way
And also the community
We we love it here
Well I'm sure you do
It's a great community

Did did the outdoor pictures come out fuzz
No , yeah not not great
I don't know is it could there be a reason for tha
There could be I don't know what it is
It could be a lens doesn't adjust well
I'm
Because it's always the outdoor pictures
right
and this I took a_lot_of outdoor pictures now
But they're not all bad
I don't know
oh reall
yeah
maybe it's
huh could be the
how you face the sun
yeah and also I think the sunnier the more bright the sun is the fuzzier it comes out for some reason
could be when it's too bright it just doesn't handle it yeah
mhm
okay
how are the real ones
good go enjoy
Anybody coming
how are the real ones just great
yumm
I decided for a half an hour I can tell you all the that don't come out on the letter
One minute your little daughter
she's
Which one
very the little one very
yeah
oh yes today she
Excuse me
Today she colored up the walls
I'm not used to looking out for her and there she is with a red crayon being
oh
Well , what what gives you that ide
The look in her eyes
She is quite
very mischievous looking very you have huh
this is quite
Brachalov g- Brachalov got up in the middle of the night
yeah
and she was wet
yeah
so she tells me even with the diaper
yeah
so she she tells me she's all wet
So we have to take off the pajamas so she tells me put them in the sun
In the middle of the nigh
yeah
So it's not like you know she I see that she's beginning to she takes the knowledge that she picks up in one place and she applies it in another place
uhhuh
I th- I think one of the most intelligent things she's said so far is one time in the middle of no place , we never discussed it or anything
says to me Poppy pants mommy skirt
oh she figured that out
I thought I thought that was pretty intelligent
What else does she sa
The other day she's telling she she Recha's her uh Sarah's her doll so she says
Sarah you want to go to the stor
okay Come into the carriage
Come we're going to the store
okay come good Sarah
and then you felt like you were hearing a tape recording of yourself
Very much very much it like it makes you really be careful
yeah
uhhuh
eh she started saying whenever I would ask her where's Sarah's bottle I don't know I don't know so then
I don't know
every time I'm about to answer I realize how many times I really was about to say I don't know
mhm
Like if she'll ask me where are my crayons where are my where are the crayons
Instead of saying I don't know , I'll say hm well let's look for them because she parrots back at me I don't know
I don't know

What shampoo no
um Shirley told me she has it's a shampoo that's herbal oils
yeah
and you mix them together
mhm
mhm
and then you take two drops of this mixture and you put it into a squeeze bottle of water
mhm
and after you wash their hair you rinse it with that
And then you don't rin-
again you take
Wha
You take some oil
It's to t-
It's shampoo
it's to prevent lice
So the shampoo that they have has Rosemarin oil in it
yeah
That's one that's the one that's supposed to be most effective
To preven
I also have yeah I also have you can rub it behind their ears
uhhuh well I bought you a kit
You can try it
oh thankyou
She said it was fantastic
How does she kno
Because a whole year her kids were good
uhhuh why it's a big problem in Lakewoo
yeah
Really
yeah
Once it's a problem it's c- you can't it just
It keeps going ring around the rosie
That's right because it's it's so difficult
From A to B to C to D to E and then it goes back to A
Right
I I sometimes feel like I you know I I want to keep it under control but to make sure that every eh d- l- you know down to the last is gone go back to tomorrow for what did I work so har
So this is supposed
You know to to keep it under control is one thing
all right so this is the she said the kids love it it smells nice
I hope so
oh good
okay worth a try that's for sure
An-
Right she says after you shampoo their hair you just spritz through this mixture
Right
You put two drops into a whole cup of water /
And you comb it
And just spritz it through their hair
oh
uhhuh
okay what , she uses a spritz bottle like a window washer
No like a squeeze bottle like a beta bottle
or a squeeze bottle
I have
yeah I have one
It comes with it
oh
They give you everything you need
oh oh oh oh
It's a whole little cute kit
mhm he charge you a fortun
No but if it's works it's worth it
yeah for sure for sure it's
But I think I'll give it to Tova Newberger
oh okay , when is she comin
Who's very looking forward to be-
yeah I just talked to Sarah Malkus who's jumping out of her skin already
yeah
yeah and also
When is Tova coming
Tova's coming the sixth I think
yeah
The sixth
Why was she going to
yeah and she's going to some relatives or something I don't know
uhhuh that's nice
yeah
uhhuh is anybody coming before tha
um yeah but I don't I we no- coming Sunday but I don't know if we have a way of getting it to him
uh no just for my pictures I'm concerned about
ah we'll try we'll try
okay Michalam are they still here Farrach's sister
I I met them
I just did I tell you
who
they wanted to come see Remopolin Mikhail and and ah Chanamalka
Farrach's sisters they're here for the whole summer
oh right
So they wanted to see Remopolin that's like you know tourist attraction
uhhuh
So I met them in a park in and we had a a nice afternoon together
uhhuh
oh very nice
Very nice I haven't see her kids in over a year
uhhuh
for sure I haven't seen her Channa she has a Channa Sarah
yeah
I haven't and I yeah she wanted to name her Sarah
but she thought it would be too confusing Sarah Sarah Chimalback so she named her Channa Sarah
yeah
uhhuh I see
So I she was born last Shavuos eh mm you know the year and some ago and I never saw her
uhhuh
So anyway
Your brothers are working hard in day cam
oh
oh yeah but then they're also enjoying it
oh good
That's what they said anyway
You could ask them
okay
um I wanted to ask you did they you know you have this Lazy_Susan in your cabinet
yeah
Is that a common item do they still sell the
It's a Rubbermaid
yeah
yeah you want one or tw
probably Tupperware sells it also
who
I was thinking Tupperware probably also sells it no
I don't recall seeing it Tupperware but maybe
uh-uh if they have like a two tiered one
yeah
because that would save a_lot_of space and you know my cabinets are very high and things are always
I think the two that I have is a two tier that I took apart
oh really
yeah
because my the shelves are relat- eh
oh your shelves are hig
not so high but they're
yeah
they're pretty high one from the other
yeah
And so so what happens is to maximize the space everything's on jumbled on top of everything else
uhhuh okay I can look
and then it's behind and it's very far it's just i- whatever
yeah all right
okay and so they also I wanted to ask you do you go to these secondhand stores some or you go only when you have a free
Sometimes
What
Brecha could use some Brecha could use some winter jumpers
Wint- jump
She has polo shirts jumpers because she has polo shirts galore
I always look for jumpers but it's not a common thing because most kids wear pants
It's not common
right uhhuh okay
All right but what size is she
it's not she has
three t four
n- no for sure four t even five t and I could always hem it
okay right
th- all the dresses that she's wearing the smallest is four t the biggest is six t
okay
jumpers all right
we can look for them
but know I could always hem them
yeah
maybe some are
or if not I mean
yeah sometimes Osh Kosh makes
If they have it
oh yeah I got one nice one Mindy my sister inlaw Mindy when Sarah was born gave me a very nice blue
yeah
uhhuh
standard I think it's Osh Kosh stuff g- jumper so it's a she has a ton of polo shirts because the ones from last year still fit her
oh uhhuh
so you know I
you were like that you didn't get wider on top
uhhuh well I was a little kid
you had a dress that Oma bought you
and it kept you kept growing but it didn't get tight on you on top
So finally I made it into a dropped waist dre- it was a blue
dress with a white ruffle I bought a blue and white checkered piece of material and I made a drop
oh and you made a skirt
It was a dropped waist dress and a ho-
Well if you don't see an-
What
I was saying if you don't see any sisters in sight so you could you know
right no no sisters
It it this is another one of your latest so what for let her wear it
Exactly but I wouldn't wasn't ready to give up this nice dress yet
this dress uhhuh
you know I called Chayita yesterday and I said if anybody knows about this deal probably she does because you told me Missus_Rubin
Her mother told me about it
Right , but she didn't know anything about it I was sure she spoke to her mother for a half an hour last week
Her mother didn't call he
and she doesn't know anything about it
huh
So what's the whole idea what are they trying to
They're studying l- eh it's for educational purposes
meaning do I sound educate
no
Too bad I'm not going back to school
it's too bad
Well you go every day
oh I got your message today
I wrote you back
I don't know if you checked it or not
um I was there in the afternoon
mm
um which messag
yeah yeah you did oh about the prayers like yeah
yeah did you get that on
mhm
okay
edit so you didn't get my answe
oh no no I wrote you back
I answered you back because I I was like
oh he is at another time
because I I read your message oh great she says something totally opposite of what the other person said what am I going to do
So I just wrote this long drawn out thing on on the net and I was like
complaining about all the different versions of every rule that you ever hear
No I wrote about I got kind of personal with it because I always like start off you know and he'd answer , bah bah bah , and then I'd just end up like talking about myself and
like you know because I know people are wondering oh why does she want to know how you make lo- up a prayer and you know
Well I mean it happens to everybody
and all that other stuff
yeah but some people are on this like kick that you know you're not supposed to ask stuff like that you know like what Dalia will post on the net
I bet some people are freaking out over that and I think that's perfectly natural to want to know , you know , stuff like tha
yeah I mean that was the purpose of this net
yeah but some people like I don't know if you were on last year when Jemilla
No I just started
yeah there was this big thing last year and I I took myself off because I didn't want to deal with it
This sister she wrote about this like cookie dough thing you know one of those like sexually perverted kind of jokey kind of postings things and so everyone was so offended and and like
you know a_lot_of people arguing back and forth
They got really petty and
mhm
it happens a_lot you kno
It happens a_lot
Stuff gets you know g- taken out of context and people get offended and stuff like that
yeah and plus because you've got y- your dealing with so many different completely different kinds of people
I didn't really realize that though
I thought it was I eh this is a really diverse network
I didn't know there was so many people
yeah so people where getting mad at Delila's thoug
I mean just read in the post people are like you know
All right I mean not today'
n- no not today but bef-
for-
okay but before yeah
yeah
yeah , you know I'm supposed to meet her next wee
Really , she lives in Michiga
No she lives in Chicago
oh
But I'm going up to Chicago because there's this Sufi conference
oh
and I'm going to stay with her until
oh that's great
I can't wait
yeah , should be fun
Because I have not left my well I mean I was in Germany for one year and then I came back from Germany last fall
mhm
and then I have not been anywhere except for my house and school since then
oh
and like the road in between it's like I got to get out
yeah that's good so how long is the conferenc
It's just for one day
oh
And it's free
That's the best thing about it
It's fre
yeah
Wow
yeah
You just have to find the means to get there , righ
for some reason I
yeah , I I am going to take the train , I think
oh
mm So you're still going to go to the
yeah , I want to actually a little I mean eh Robin already like paid for everything so I feel really bad if I don't go and I think he's kind of counting on me to go too so
yeah
I'm just going to go
I all I have to do is find a way to get there which I haven't found yet and it's really
oh reall
yeah it's coming up really soon
Because I thought you got
I don't think I'll take a plane there but I don't know , a bus or a train or something
oh because I know that I mean if you got here you could probably ride with Robin
yeah , I was thinking of that too but I don't even
But that will probably cost the same just to come here as
yeah
I brought like she said she was driving alone so I wouldn't mind like I even said to her you know I'll come there and then I can drive with you
yeah actually I kind of probably I mean , is she driving there by hersel
yeah
yeah because because I don't I mean I think she's okay right now but it would be much better if she didn't have to drive by herself
yeah , I think so too I I think that's you know I want to do that but I think she doesn't want me to go through all that trouble
yeah
but I told her it's no big deal
I figure take the bus or the train there and then we can drive down together you know
yeah , I mean I think that would be nice
I mean just cau- and also because it is nice to go like if you are going to a big place not to go along because
yeah
because who knows how hard it'll be to find somebody once you're there
right and I'll be alone I I won't know anything
yeah
And she's been here before like to the conference but I don't know if she's been to ohi- o- Ohio , righ
yeah
yeah
It's in Columbu
yeah , and also I'm kind of worried about her because like you d- I don't know if she talked to you about her health
yeah , she has
yeah eh yeah
yeah because there's I mean like a like last a c- few weeks ago she was like losing control of her hand and now she's on some kind of medication that's like put it back like she can use her hands again
mhm
But she's like she had to have her hand bandaged up and stuff and like she was having a real hard time at work
so that would me nervous like if she was going to drive by herself you know like what happens you know if something cooky goes wrong with her hand
and she can't drive but I guess she's at she's taking some medication now so I guess it's okay but
hm
yeah , I tried calling her tonight but I got her answering machine so I left her a message to her
hm
She calls me back I'll tell her that's what I'll do because I was thinking about that too but you know she like throws it off make it seems like it's no big deal so and I think oh well but
well just tell her that you'd prefer her company or something th- then then it won't be like you know she doesn't want to put you out for you know inconvenience but
if you make it sound like you want to do it then she'll probably agree
yeah
yeah
So y- you still are not thinking of going , righ
No , I think not
yeah
yeah , I mean because even before all that weird stuff you know I've been talking about I've always like had a kind of weird feeling about them anyway
I mean the whole organization just because I don't know it seems kind of strange like I don't know it's hard to hard to explain but just real
Like someone me today and she said it would be like a you know she said you know we should really go to a conference you know as a group because I'll be living with like four or five sisters this fall who rented a place
yeah
and so she said you know it would be nice if we could go to a conference but it would have to be all females because she hears that some of them are meat markets so I mea- I I've heard other th-
oh really
yeah
And I was like whoa I didn't you know I didn't even think of that but it's kind of true
a_lot_of eh
People looking for a
eligible women right
yeah
in one place but I don't know I don't know
mm
If I hate the experience then I'll never go to another one but if it turns out to be okay then I you know it's okay
yeah
I mean I heard that it's like real I mean that it that it is enjoyable you know people talk about you know religious things and get really into it and stuff
yeah
um I guess that w- what I had heard bad about it was just that they were so into talking about like the Koran and stuff but they that they weren't using this as being like a tool for social change at all like they weren't talking about what we could possibly do
mm
As Muslims to like improve the world but rather just well just spend all your time praying kind of philosophy
oh
And so e-
Nine thousand people and that's it , hu
hu
I said nine thousand people and that's all they tau- and that's all they find to do with that you know they have like uh a large group of people , they could really make a difference but they I don't know I haven't been to one so I d-
yeah yeah I haven't been to it either so I can't really talk
mm
But , yeah , I think that they just don't want to get really radical
Right
for whatever re- I mean because I guess like Saudi Arabia funds it a_lot and
yeah , th- they were talking about the go- Azum is that hi- the person's name Azarahim I've never heard of like this person
yeah , I've never heard of him either
and they said that he's like a crim- he's a murderer and stuff like that
yeah
I don't know
And then there's the Mike Tyson thing that a_lot_of us have
not too you know happy about that
yeah
And
Well , it will be interesting to see what he has to say
yeah
Did you read my post like what I wrote about him and stuff like
That he was talking about his girlfriend or something
yeah , he's talking about well I can't even kiss my girlfriend and I was like no you don't do that to your girlfriend , what is that
So it was it's like he doesn't really know I don't know
He I mean that's what he doesn't even have the basics down you know
like I think I'm like we were at the beginning stage like I am
I I have the basics down and that's it but he doesn't even have that that like I I mean before I that there was no like girlfriend boyfriend thing and every
you know , and other stuff
No pork any of that stuff but it's like he's just you know
yeah I
out of it
He doesn't have control over his life
That's what I think and so you know when people rag on him I I I tend to take the
like the side of you know like Mike Tyson because he really doesn't know
I mean he knew what he did but it's it
not all him , you know
Other people control him and tell him what to do and where to spend his money and stuff like that
yeah I mean I generally j- hur- just stay away from the T V anyway
yeah , I'm a T V magnet
So I never know about these things except for when people talk about it
I'm a T V magnet
So I forgot what you did , you're a grad student , righ
No , actually I'm the eternal bachelor's student
You're a wha
A bachelor's or undergrad or whatever you call i
oh really
yeah
What year are yo
Working on I think this is my fifth year
oh really
oh that's not bad
I'll
I'll be a fifth year
I mean I won't be one next year but it's going to get to that point I can't finish my major in in three years
I'm going to need three because my first two years I I can't tell you what I did with those
yeah
So it's like I'm in the same boat too
yeah , what do you
But you've already graduated though , righ
Wha
You've already graduated , righ
No , see I'm working on like three degrees at one time so it's going to be another three years before I graduate
oh
Unless I just decide to give up and just take what I've got
So what do you have so fa
or do you
Well right now if I I could graduate with a German degree right now
mhm
but German degree is useless
Right
Unless you get a P h D or something
mhm
So , I'm also working on an English degree because that's my real interest
You really English literature and not li- literature , righ
yeah well what I really really love is like medieval stuff
oh wow
and that's why I really think that like eng- English and German goes together really well i- if you're interested in medieval
mm
because in the past English and German used to be the same language like about the year before the year seven hundred
Wow
You know , because like in Europe it was all like wandering pagan tribes and they just like they came you know they came down the Goths and all them
mhm
like they used to I mean they spoke Germanic language and some of them settled in Germany and some people kept on walking and kept on going to England and so the language gradually changed after that
Wow
oh this is perfect timing because my baby's sleeping so that's great
oh good
all right
This is this was the last day I could do this so I had to get it in right now
I've had this number for a month
oh
and kept thinking I'm going to do it
I'm going to do it
oh I'm so glad you called
yeah it's just about ten until twelve at midday
And your mom's still there isn't sh
They just left on Monday
oh okay
and they went to New Zealand
They're in New Zealand right now and they're there f- for until Monday I think
okay
okay
I've been leaving her messages on her machine
oh
because we moved to Casper
You're in Casper
yeah we moved here I know that's very amazing
I'm still amazed haven't caught my breath yet
It all happened so very quickly
Why did p- Barry get a job or somethin
He has a job
He got one after we came here
oh great
Well it isn't
I bet your mom is thrilled
yeah yeah it was a good time to move
We were gone long enough to know what it was like to live other places and
enjoyed other places and now it makes it more enjoyable to be back
yeah
And it was just right
We'd been praying for years what we were supposed to do
We always thought we were going to move to Denver and live in my grandmother's house that had died
uhhuh
But that didn't work out and about two months ago one morning I told Barry I said honey I said really think that we're to move to Casper
and the next day I talked to my granny and she had moved up here last year
mhm
to be by mom and she said she had felt that for a whole year after praying that we were to move here too she just had never said anything to anybody
mhm
And so
she told me she had thought we should look for a house that had a big backyard and apartments that we could rent to pay the mortgage
that she just thought there would be one we could find like that so we started looking on vacation a couple of mon- weeks ago
and we found one it's a hundred and fifty thousand and I said granny I said we can't afford that she said well you know if that's what God wants he'll provide it so we did all the paperwork and the bank turned us down
but then we did find the house
We found h- another one for half the price for sixty six thousand had two apartments in the back that the lady had fixed up brand new
and a big backyard for the kids with a big cedar fence just like grandma had thought we should have we found it and we are getting the house
That's great
yep she had prayed
Are you staying with your mom at the momen
yep we're at mom's
It all happened so fast we just knew it was meant to be
Wow
Like everything fell in place
It's like God was taking care of it and we were the actors
And Barry found a job right away
yeah somebody hired him over the phone long distance
It was really weird
So he finished school in Omah
yep
And he's doing like is it m- massage and stuff is that what it
Right well and a_lot_of physical therapy
He's at the Shepherd At The Nursing Care Center
oh great
working with the older people
oh isn't that good
oh Alison that means we get to spend so much time together when I come home
I know
You know a lady called me two weeks there's a little old Christian Indian lady in Omaha that I know God provided in my life because she's been such an encouragement to me and Barry
oh
And her and her husband he's a l- just a real dear you know And about two weeks before we moved here
she called me at home and she said she'd been praying all morning for us and she said Alison she said I c- I just felt real strong I needed to call and tell you that
that God's taking you to your promised land and she said see she doesn't know my personal life you know we just share you know what I mean but she she doesn't know like me personally you know everything about us
but it was amazing the insight she had into she said into us she said you know she said it just God showed me that you guys were made the best out of Omaha and you were like the children of Israel and you didn't complain and kick and scream in the wilderness you know
yeah
And so because you were trusted God and made the best of it he's taking you to your promised land quicker than if you'd complained the whole time and she just had this wonderful
oh it just gave me chills all over
I started crying
oh
And and she said so you know just trust Him because he's taking you to where he wants you to be because you were faithful you know in Omaha
and it was kind of like a wilderness
We did make the best of it you know
yeah
But her insight was so perceptive
I started crying
I was like oh that's wonderful And so then she says well we love you good bye
aw
And that is what it was like too you know
We made the best of it tried not to complain
You really have to yeah
and made the best of it and then this is like the promised land to us
It might not be to someone else you know
mhm
But for us it is
yeah
And then I was thinking just like you said if you come down here around Christmas time I won't have to worry about getting up here you know
I know it that's going to be great I'm supposed to be there I'm going to go to Denver first and then I'll come up to Casper on December fourth
I know
okay okay aw good
And then I will be there and I'll be there till after Christmas then
oh and the baby
yeah oh Alison he is beautiful
oh I get to be its aunt
Auntie Alison
Yes
He'll call you auntie
oh
oh he is so beautiful and he's such a good baby

That's wonderful
Well Ti the other day was teasing me because he wants to have them right in a row and I don't want to have another one till like I'd like to get pregnant in a year and he kept
Well let me speak to him about having them in a row I can fill him in on that
I know it because I tol- he was teasing me and saying we don't need to use anything because it's impossible to get pregnant when you're breast feeding and I just laughed at him I said no I said my friend Alison got pregnant when she was breast feeding
I'm sorry
yeah
you know I wanted to wait a long time to have this next one but there i- th- it'll work out it'll it'll be okay
yeah
because like Audrey wasn't intended but I wouldn't trade her for anything
yeah
aw isn't that good
aw and little Audrey
And it'll be okay because the little house we have has four bedrooms
Is she going to be two when she'll be more than two when I come home no she'll be
She'll be ei- nineteen months and then when the baby's born she'll be like twenty two months so it's not like just right after
just
yeah
I- yeah it's not like your first two hu
Nope
What's the distance between Audrey and your little bo
Andrew
yeah Andrew
I don't know
Maybe fifteen months
The
Fifteen months

So you guys are bus
Are you working at al
yeah
Well you know what Alison this
A little bi
yeah this is just so wonderful the I would
Good
I took twelve months off work and then
Right
I've w- you know been thinking a_lot about how you know going back maybe in twelve months just two days a week or something but I really
Right
didn't know about that and the day before I left work I got a phone call from the university here that I used to work at
Right
And they needed somebody as what they call a tutor
oh
you have like a one hour session with the class and you just kind go over the lecture material with them
My
Right
and so and they needed somebody right away and it was actually starting kind of like the week I was supposed to have the baby so they gave me two weeks off and then I've started doing that and it's only one day a week
and it's for like I have three classes and then they pay me to mark all their exams and stuff so I'm going to make like in the fourteen weeks I'm doing that I'm going to make about
oh it's nice
a l- a little less than three thousand dollars so the Lord's really looked after me that way that will practically pay for my trip home my you know like my ticket and stuff
Right
oh that's wonderful so glad
yeah it's great
And I finish right before I come home so that's really good and it's only like I only have to leave him at the babysitter for four hours
That's fine a momma needs
A little bit of ti-
a whole day off a week equivalent you know in hours I'm sure convinced rather it's to work a job she likes or
garden or do whatever
yeah
Gives you more time that's better with them when you're with them
yeah
Because I always taught those two mornings two to three ever since I've had the babies and it was just enough time you know
it's four year wait
And the kids love to go see where I was teaching and
aw that's
you know if I'd been gone all the time I don't think they would have gone for that as much
No
But since it was such a short amount of time they loved to hear about what happened and
hm yep
aw that's good
so lot lots has transpired here and lots transpired at your house
Right we'll have lots to catch up on
yep yep I'll have to bring pictures we have
huh I'm so tired
What time is it ther
It's about eight twenty
I get real tired in my pregnancies
So how far along are yo
I have no idea
I'll have to try to figure it out
Have you seen a doctor ye
No
Alison I had the best birth
aw I'm so glad
I had thirty two hours of labor
but I had they have the most excellent program here
I got a community midwife
so I had a team of two midwives looked after me during the whole pregnancy and
aw
aw
I don't think you gave me an address , though
I might not ha- not have had one then
Right
I didn't get it right at first
So
So , when did you get ther
I started work August first so what's today , the nine- twentieth or somethin
uhhuh
The twentieth yeah
yeah and I arrived in Detroit just the night before I started work so I had been here just three weeks
It will be three weeks Tuesday
That I started work and so I worked in the office for a week in a half and then we had our orientation for the new volunteers
uhhuh
And that was out in western Michigan on Lake Michigan about four hours from here
so we went up there and spent a week almost a week
sounds nice
Did you take your car did you drive ther
I drove up here , yeah
From Omah
yup
Wow
It took a couple days
I mean it
it would have been maybe fourteen or fifteen hours
I didn't want to do it all in one day so I broke it up
and stopped in Wisconsin at a friend's house
Right
So so anyway we have fifty six new volunteers that are oriented and off
They left for their new homes on Thursday and we came we came back to Detroit so
uhhuh
How many of you are ther
On staf
Right
There's five of us on staff
The director /
uhhuh
three area directors , and then
I don't know what Kate Kate is the woman I'm living with
I'm not sure what her position is called it's kind of like development
And helps the director with fundraising
I'm I'm not sure
what special
And the director's in Detroit
yeah , we're all in Detroit but the area directors um travel to the cities that the volunteers are in
and you know meet with the communities and stuff like that
So
What's your area the
I go to Kansas City , Saint Louis , Des Moines , and then I also have the community here in Detroit
oh that's cool
So yeah I me-
Old stomping ground
I know
It's so cool
Do you have to go so many times during the year or
I go I go once in the fall for a week to each city and then once in the spring so well late winter I guess
So when I go in October I go first to Kansas City then to Saint Louis then I come back to Detroit and we have our
our fall retreat is in Dubuque , Iowa so that's in the middle of my area visits and then
then I go to , then I do my Detroit area visit , then I go to Des Moines
but the way it works out for Kansas City and Saint Louis I go to Kansas City and at the end of the week it's my birthday
mhm
So I spend the morning of my birthday with Elisa and then I fly to Saint Louis and spend
you know the afternoon with Chris or Lou or whoever I hook up with in Saint Louis so
mhm
I'm like wow that worked out perfectly
That's cool
yeah , so
So it sounds like you're going to be gone a_lo
yeah , from October sixth through Thanks- through Thanksgiving I'm here like I don't know ten days or something nutty like that and then
oh really
Are you going to go home for Thanksgivin
I don't know yet
I'm going home
in September for just a a three day weekend or something like that um because September is pretty much the slo- one of the slowest months on the job so
mhm
And I haven't been to Texas in a while so I thought that would work out and then at Christmas time I think two of my cou- well one of my cousins is getting married near Kansas City and I'm hoping my family will just come up to Kansas for that
mm
mhm
And then I'll go there and see them so I don't know about Thanksgiving yet
That's too far away to figure out so anyway I will be
Gosh , are you happ
yeah , I am I it was really hard to make the decision I actually at one point decided no I'm not going to go I I just like I don't think I want to start all over again and /
mhm
I'm I'm liking being in Omaha and all that sort of thing and so I called and and told the director you know I thought about it a_lot blah blah blah but I eh just don't think it's right for me right now and
mhm
He was like I I don't know him very well but he'd he had strep throat when I was here I mean he just wasn't feeling well I mean was like well
mhm
okay and
later that morning Kate called me at work
in in Omaha
And I'm like Kate are calling to make this really hard on me an-
eh
She's like we just want you to think about one more thing and
eh the job is supposed to be a a two year commitment
uhhuh
But , and that was kind of like one of the things that I'm
thinking I don't know about doing a two year commitment eh you know
all this sort of thing
That is was too long or that it was too short
well
no , I mean it could be longer so it's not like it was too short
It was just
Right
you know I don't know
I don't know what I was thinking but anyway so they're like what if it was just a one year commitment and
I said well I'll think about it
kind of threw me off and then
I I called later and I asked the director if um
I said well would you be willing to a first year um area director makes seventeen thousand and a second year area director makes eighteen thousand five hundred
First year you get three weeks vacation
Second year you get four weeks and I said well would you be willing to hire me as if I was coming in at a second year
mhm
um eh at eighteen five with four weeks of vacation and he said yeah he w- he would be willing to do that
Wow that's a_lot_of vacation
yeah it is which is wonderful
That's great
mm
And that's more important to me than money so
Right yeah
So , and we take we get the whole week from Chri- Christmas to New Year that's one of our weeks of vacation so it's only
mhm
you know in addition to that so
So anyway ,
And the rest you can take pretty much eh when you want I mean you work it around your schedule
Right
yeah , you got to work it around your schedule which is
i- in you know summer is not a really good time to take it because
you're ending one year and starting the next year and you know doing a_lot with the p- the volunteers coming in
mhm
so I'll probably try to take most of it before next summer , we'll see
mhm
um so I tho- I thought about it that day and I ended up calling back and saying
okay I'm coming to Detroit so
It's been really good since I've I mean actually I made the decision and I thought ohgod what am I doing you know I'm I just was
still unsure about it but within in a couple days I just felt really at peace with it
and remained so throughout the time that I prepared to leave and then ever since I've been here I keep thinking
okay why am I so okay with this I'm going to be falling apart any minute , right you kno
Because I'm really used to transition hitting me a little bit harder especially when I was so ambivalent about the decision but
Right
um
I don't know
It's been great
That's great
So yeah
Great
Don't question i
Go with it
yeah exac- that's what I said finally
I was telling somebody somebody is like well how you doin
I said well
I I'm fine you know I keep wondering how long that's going to last
I'm fine what's wrong with me
and then finally I'm like you know
I am just going to be okay that I'm okay
and if I'm not okay later that's fine but right now I'm okay I have to stop wondering when it's going to end so
So that's kind of where I've been
hm hm So tell me about New_York I got your postcard
oh , New_York was r- was really fun I I loved the city
It was
yeah
I I don't know I didn't expect to enjoy the city so much
You had been there before though hadn't you
n
Just really briefly
I went to Long Island
for a friend's wedding and
Kate Katie and I , my housemate from Oregon went together
uhhuh
and we we took a train into the city ,
a cab to the Metropolitan Museum Art
ran around there for an hour and half , took a cab back , and then the train back to Long Island so I mean that was it
That's all we saw
oh that was it
um and I liked that but it just it didn't even feel like I had actually been in the city you know
mhm
So ,
so this was more like you know we we did a_lot_of the
the touristy stuff and walked on the Brooklyn Bridge and
mhm
took the ferry and
um walked in Central Park and
went to a show and all that sort of stuff so it was really fun
Sounds great
and we also went out to to Long_Island where Joe's mom lives /
uhhuh
and spent time with the whole family
So
which was which was okay
It was good
At first when we had were planning the trip he had
he's like oh I hope we can go out and you know go to the beach and you can
meet my my brother and my nieces and nephe- he's got four brothers three brothers two of them live on Long Island
You want to meet my brothers and my nieces and nephews and I'm like
um I don't know Joe I don't I said I I think maybe we need the we need the time just to kind of figure out where our relationship is before
mhm
I said it's not that I don't want to meet your family it's just I don't know I I /
That's a_lot at once
I know his mom too and I think she's a little bit leery of this whole relationship based on what happened in the past you know
mhm
and I hurt her son and all that sort of thing
I'm like
I just don't know if I'm ready for that and so
but it it wor- ended up happening that it was his brother's birthday and we were out there to go to the beach and
so I'm like okay we can you know I can handle this and
it was very nice actually so
Good
that was fine
and
So where did things end u
oh I don't know , Vick ,
it was really fun and
I mean in some ways Joe is somebody I've known a long time and
and know pretty well
but in other ways it's like this is a whole new relationship
mhm
so it's it's kind of weird to walk that balance like well
you know , one minute we're talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together
and the next you_know I'm like
Wow
wait a minute I can't believe we're talking about this I mean
What's he doing no
He's in his last year of graduate school at Columbia University
He's getting his Masters in Public Administration
uhhuh
And he's been working with this man who's starting a no- a new nonprofit organization
he worked with him last summer and this summer and probably will work with during the school year
Beyond that
I don't he doesn't know what he's going to do you know but it's
you know it's kind of hard because /
Kind of open but
He might want
I mean chances are really good that he'll want to stay in New York or at least on the east coast , you kno
Right
Kind of interested in politics so D C would be an option and
I don't know
It's just hard because
that's not really
yeah
where I'm at but I mean we're both sort of like we don't know where life is taking us
and
Hard to start a relationship when that
yeah , so what do we do
you know do we make decisions based on each other I mean this was just the second weekend we saw we've seen each other so
he's coming here over Labor Day weekend /
mhm
and then
because my schedule gets so crazy
starting in the middle middle of October I am going to
go go there the first weekend of October
That was kind of hard for us to decide
you know he hasn't even been here yet
I haven't seen him since the Fourth of July weekend and
and we decided well you know let's go ahead
Now what's the size of it compared to the other place because now I remember that
The size of the classrooms
yeah
um maybe two thirds as big
mhm mhm
But see I have fewer children too
oh that's good how many
About twenty or twenty two
oh that's good
mhm smallest class in the school
mm
They range I think from my twenty to up about thirty two
And what grade is it agai
Third
okay
They don't like to pass thirty but I think the seventh grade has thirty two
uhhuh
And they might not all show up either
You know you never can tell with people like that
Right
Right
So we shall see
oh
Well I'm glad you have a smaller number now
oh and it's all one grade
all one grade it's
Tammy you almost won't know what to do with yourself
oh I think I'll find many a thing to do somehow
oh oh gosh so have you seen any other teacher
oh yes see when the principal was away two of the men the second grade teacher John McCall who's a lovely gentleman and the computer teacher Mr Deverow covered the office for the principal
hm hm
I see
So John McCall was doing it last week and Mr Deverow was doing it the week before that
uhhuh
So they were very helpful
Now will your class have much opportunity to use the computer
oh yes once a week they go up
uhhuh
For forty five minutes
I have three computers in my classroom
Do yo
Yes every classroom has two or three
mhm
oh
mhm
hey that's good
yeah it's great
eh they're real old you know the ones in the room they're like
uhhuh
the old Commodores I think
mm
but they're I B M compatible
That's good and so like what program is in it what will you use it fo
mhm
Well I think what he's done see Mr Deverow makes these discs
uhhuh
to go with your work
oh
So if you want s- something on you know addition of facts up to nine , he'll have a disc that you can use to reinforce that those skills
Really
Yes , he's done that
hey that's great
He spends his he's been there twenty five years they say
Really
yeah so he has spent many many hours just making discs for the teachers
That's fantastic
mhm and we have an art teacher , a music teacher , and a gym teacher
Wow
And a fulltime librarian plus an assistant librarian who's a Sister
My goodness
A Benedictine Sister so you do get three forty minute periods well about three half hour periods by the time you take them and bring them back a week
Yes right right
mm
but I think you also have to stay with the children all during lunch and recess
oh so that's a trade-off
I think you need that forty minutes
So when do you get your lunch you eat with the
Well I think you eat with them as far as I know
What do they eat in their room is that i
In the classroom yes as far as I know
aw gee aw gee
And I hate that
I hate to have food in the room
I do too yeah
Because it makes animals but however
oh dear
well speaking of animals remember the fleas we had at Immaculate Conception last year that I was telling you abou
Yes yeah
They're back again
At Immaculate Conception oh
At Immaculate Conception Carol Anne said she was eaten alive the other day
no oh
And was over there helping her with something on the computer
yeah
came home she was she had welts all over her whole legs
uhoh
I said where were you toda
She said Immaculate Conception I said they're fleas
oh
No she said no
yes they are
oh
So Carol Anne had to get the exterminator to put the bombs in the rooms again
oh my goodness
They closed everything up on Friday and they bombed out the whole place for the weekend
oh
But how did they come back I guess all the eggs stay in the rug is that i
Well I don't know I guess they do but that's a long time incubating I mean you didn't have them through the entire year and then
yeah no we didn't have them again unless they come in the windows in the summer
mm
See that could be it
yeah maybe there's some way
And they infest the rugs
Because there are no animals around there righ
Animal
No no no dogs or cats or raccoons right yeah well there could be rats
mm
Rats or anything like that
I've never seen any
oh
Mice I'm sure there are but
yeah
oh gee well thank God you discovered them now before school started could you imagine
right right
Well they were in the building when we started school last year
oh
The little kindergarteners were all bitten when they sat down on the floor
ah oh
Because they were covered with bandaids on their legs
aw
And one mother wrote a note
dear Mrs Henry my child is bitten by something on her legs you must have fleas in the school
oh
But th- they're the most awful bites I've ever had
Yes I had a I was in a patient's home once and they had fl- oh they are awful I I thought
mhm and the marks stay with you
I thought I really can commiserate with animals now little dogs when I see them scratching oh it's a terrible thing
mhm yes oh yes oh yeah mhm
oh
And they bleed and form this terrible scab
yeah
eh
oh
Well tell me about your life no
oh I had a wonderful time down in Baltimore
mhm
Really good symposium I love the workshops and then in the evenings my mom and I linked up together and we did something different each night
oh nice
yeah the first night we went over to the Inner Harbor and then the second night they had scheduled a cruise you know on the Spirit of Baltimore you know
oh yes
And fortunately , that hurricane didn't affect us it was supposed to hit that night you know and have very choppy waters and everything but it didn't it was a beautiful evening
mhm mhm uhhuh
and that wa- was about a three hour cruise
oh nice
Yes
It wa- we were on the ship over three hours and actually moving about three I guess and then the third night we went over to Little Italy and had a very nice Italian dinner
oh
yeah it was fun
oh good
really was and the the Little Italy looks very much like south Philadelphia actually
ah
And the restaurants are in the row houses the row houses are just kind of broken through on the insides you know and
ah mhm uhhuh
yeah so it was fun really was yeah and my mom got a_lot_of rest while I was
oh that sounds nice
oh good mhm
At the workshops all day she was just resting enjoying herself and
Right yeah mhm
That's nice she could go with you mhm
yeah I'm glad she could because just it happened to work out because she had three days left of vacation and it was three days so
Right yes mhm and then you had a good time at the beach I know at Stone Harbor
oh yeah that was nice and relaxing that was great too it really was so the thing with this the hotel happened to be about a block away from Camden Yards which is the stadium
Yes mhm
Well we arrived just as the traffic was going in for the game well I didn't know there was a game I mean I didn't even know where I was going you know I was just following the directions well the traffic I was beside myself I said oh my goodness
oh no oh mhm mhm
and here when we you know as we approached the stadium we saw that's where people were headed and we said oh there must be a game and sure enough there was so for the first three days the Orioles had a home game
ah
So the traffic was unbe- but I didn't drive once you know I got there but we were just walking around and they're such avid fans it's unbelievable I mean everything was the Orioles you know and of course I know nothing about the Orioles other that they're a team you know
mhm
And it seems one of their players is about to break Lou Gehrig's record or something
oh yes it was on the T V mhm
oh listen to you you know all this stuff see I didn't you_know but in fact the one of the fellows is talking about this player whom I never heard of you know and how proud they are of him and everybody he says oh this whole town's going to go crazy when he breaks that record
mhm well I've seen it on the T V yeah
oh boy mm
all this you know so oh well So the good old Phillies we're not quite that avid fans
No they've gone down to the bottom again haven't they or pretty close
oh they probably well they won today
Or did the
Yes Pat was listening to the game
They won today in the tenth inning
oh
And they won another game this week so that's good you know they're coming up a little bit you know but
Well maybe they'll get back up there mhm
they really get into these slumps I mean it's unbelievable
Yes mhm yeah mhm
Once a you almost hate to see them lose a game because it's as though here goes l- about twelve or thirteen they're going to lose you know it's like they don't just lose one or two and then win it's just they get into a real slump
mhm
Well but anyway and so t- and now it's just Pat and I home this evening
oh that's all Mary's away
She's on retreat
mhm
She gets back Tuesday I think
uhhuh
And
question how did you see Annette toda
I did yeah Pat and I went over eh we went over this morning about eleven
How's she doin
mhm
Well she looked well eh she's on complete bed rest because she has the phlebitis
hm
uhhuh
Definitely and they had to give her the Heprin and of course that affects her platelets and
oh
And you know she said he was going to give her the chemotherapy this Thursday
oh wow
So I don't know she said I'm just disgusted and
mhm
You know I could appreciate this but I'm thinking why doesn't he hold off another week
aw
aye
you know I mean you know each one is counteracting the other it
Yes oh
It's a hard I I mean I know it's not an easy decision for him to make
yeah hm
Nor for her either , but I'm thinking ohmygosh , you kno
But she seemed in good spirit
hm
um had a couple books there
mhm
had the T V on when we got there and she said I'm really dozing through this you know it was one of the new shows
hm yes
But and then Ray Catherine I saw yesterday
ah hm
and
she's going to live at New Sherry now is that it yeah
Yes she told me that
She told me that
mhm
So
The day that she that I was leaving
was the day that she moved in there , you know
that morning yet , well
oh really oh
that morning
Thank God Irene I had cleaned the room before
oh
oh my goodness
because after that
You mean the day that Marcia picked you u
That da
oh
Yes that's right
I knew Marcia would be there like after lunch or so
uhhuh
And I said I'm not going to have to spend this whole morning cleaning this room
yeah
Plus doing all my laundry and the wash and packing up
Right
So I said let me do all the r- the big cleaning the day before
uhhuh
At least Lorraine said my Lord you've got the room
better than you had ever seen it in your life
oh
Not knowing this was going to happen
ohmygosh
Now after mass Friday morning , Dorothy says to me , how packed are yo
I said well I said I'm in pretty good shape
I have to make the bed you know and take the towels out
yeah
and put the rest of my clothes in the bag
Well she says
See if you can do it in a hurry because Marie Catherine's moving into that room
ohmygosh
I thought wasn't it good that I had done all the cleanin
oh yeah
I looked at the room
Left to vacuum the rug
That's all I left to the last thing
oh
And my suitcase to all close up
The only thing that bothers me was I had to get out and then go into like a hallway
and I froze
One bag full of halves
to make Aunt Annie's peach cake
mhm
in the Winter
so we'll see what happens
I made a wonderful peach thing last week
um you know the recipe book that Jane gave me
yeah
at Christmas time from
deserts from your bread maker
yeah
well you make the dough and you leave it in the bread maker until it goes through a couple of cycles of
ye- kneading and raising and all that kind of stuff and then you take it out
before it bakes
mhm
and you divide it into two and let it sit for a few minutes
and then press into like a round
pizza pan
oh
and then I put now the kids had picked berries along the road
um
uh raspberries blackberries and huckleberries
So I made one with that on it
and the other one I sliced peaches real thin and then you put cinnamon sugar and and melted butter
on the top and bake it and of course it's a real
you know it's a yeast dough
mhm
uh it's a real good dough
yeah and good
and boy they were and it it tells you
the recipe actually calls for some kind_of a
on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or sour cream
something like that
so we just used Cool Whip and it was
it was very good it was very nice I took one I coo-
uhhuh
to the guy across the road who cut the grass for us while we were away
uhhuh
and I- I
and he enjoy it
I have no idea
um as a matter of fact I keep meaning to ask him and we've been
we've talked on several occasions they kind of paved our road this week
oh
um
what do you mean kind of
well
have the new people have been after him about
the potholes and the dust and everything else you know
mhm
and she goes down there on a regular
basis and and raises a fuss
mhm
and they finally said well then they'd be out
and they they
oh I don't know it was
they it it just keeps get getting pushed back and back well finally they came out I think out Monday
uh well no actually when we came home we noticed that they'd shaved some some of the
uh swale off across the road
now they still have not fixed that pipe which is my big complaint the whole time
mhm
It's still hanging up in the air and Everhart is beside himself because
we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wouldn't get their tires cut on it you know
mhm
well they never ha- they didn't do that but
um what they did wa- well now let me see first Monday
they turned off the water here all all morning on Monday
because the pipe had sprung a leak
uhhuh
so they had to fix that before they could do the road then they came down Tuesday and they did all this preparation work
they dug
they put a pipe sort of
caddywampus under under the road just below
our driveway and before the new peoples' driveway
but the way they put it in mother
and left it
it blocked our pipe so that anything that would've gone
through our pipe would've backed up immediately
and and flooded our property
What kind of engineers do they have working down there
oh Everhart said he doesn't think they have any idea at all you know
well I went up to help
the band
people help fit band uniforms
yeah
Now you know that in my day we got our uniforms fit but there weren't parents you know
this is all done by the parents
oh
um so I went up to help
and I got there at eight o'clock and around eleven I called home and Everhart was beside himself
uh you know as soon as the kids told him it was me he told them to tell her
wha- that they'd made a colossal mess out of the road
and so I said to I've got to go I've got to go see what's wrong
well the- i- they dug this deep trench and
put these huge rocks
in the road
Now when I back out I have to be careful
that I don't go into the ditch across the road where these great big huge rocks are
mm
um you know I I can't I just can't even begin to tell you well
at any rate they got all that done
and then they came along and
what they're buying now is stuff
called well it's crushed asphalt it's recycled road basically
yeah
and
they told us that
it's it
holds up better than the stone that they'd been putting on
and it also
well it it's so delightful to come down the road and not be followed by a cloud of dust you know
yeah
but they put it all on and smoothed it they they came down with uh great big heavy rollers and
all that kind of stuff and
um it it actually looks like road out there
so
uh I'm pleased about that you know the way they did the other stuff
well that's g-
and I said to him I said to Everhart
it's not m- they did come back and dig out
our ditch
mhm
and fill our ditch with stones too great big stones
eh
and I said Everhart
just don't get upset about because
if the lot next to us ever gets built on
they're going to have to come back and do it again
yeah
because there's no place
i- i- there's
the pipe that they put in will pour water right into this pe- person's front yard
hm
um you know and and I said I I can't help it that they do things in such a
dumb way that's you know it's it's very annoying it's very frustrating especially when you're paying for the privilege of having them make a mess
yeah yeah
you know
so there was a terrible accident down here last night terrible
um up
where
eh yeah
you know on the highway when you come down and route two and four join up there
yeah
um
apparently a t- tour bus was coming down from Annapolis
never stopped
there and hit a a car travelling north head on
and Andrew's coach said today that they brought two dead
to the hospital and at least seventeen from the tour bus in serious condition
ohgod
must have been a terrible terrible thing you know
oh yeah
why listen if we come up
yeah
all night on
Labor Day weekend
yeah
do you want me to make a reservation at The Quality
Well when would you be coming u
probably Saturday
as of right now Andrew has practice on Friday and Karen has it
Saturday morning
well
if you come up Saturday you'll only be here
what Saturday and Sunday night
right right
and we won't be here
the three o'clock in the afternoon is the reception
mhm
Now I don't think
it's going to be that late
you know because it's out in the yard
uhhuh
So
you know I I don't know why it wouldn't be alright to stay here
alright well we got this thing
one of the places that we stayed in and I think it might have been the the one
in New Jersey
um where there's a special rate at at Qualities or Comforts you know what I mean
yeah
and I said to Everhart I may just give them a call and see what it is you know and that way
mhm
if it's if it's not real expensive
and we're not invited on Sunday then we could swim you know
mhm
um you don't think we will be right
it's it's Saturday
oh it's Saturday
yeah it's Saturday three o'clock in the afternoon
oh I thought you said Sunday
yeah well that's what I thought but the invitation came it's Saturday
so oh oh by invitation only
well you have to respond
oh my
yeah
what are they doing catering it
no they're having a it's all cold
cold stuff
mhm
and a wedding cake
mhm
and they have
they're going to have a couple cases of beer
and they have a case of wine
uh they got in Maryland
mhm
um
wine by the the box
oh yeah yeah
and
you know that's what they're going to have and
mhm
of course there's people coming from Philadelphia so
I just don't imagine it's going to be that late
right
but it would be Saturday an-
you wouldn't be here
well whatever time you get here you certainly can have something to eat
and
Sunday we can swim if you want
oh well that would be fine that would be fine
okay
yeah Saturday is my birthday you know
yeah well
may- maybe I'll even bake you a cake
well I I don't suspect anybody here will you know
yeah
I'm trying to get all this stuff wrapped up
I got a call
you know I told you that there was a job that I was interested in within the school district
yeah
but you didn't get it
and I I didn't even get a chance at it because they they
did something crazy you know well
um my friend called me the other day and said hey
across my desk came that announcement again it's open
and I said you've got to be kidding me I was told that it was all but
wrapped up well
here what they did they changed it
in an attempt I gue- I don't know why but it was supposed to be a director's position
so and we went to Niagara Falls and we went on the Maid Mist you know the boat that goes like under the falls
no
you don't alright well there's a boat that goes
you go out on this boat and they give you these plastic raincoats which are dangerous but and then I
speak up I can only hear about one out of every other word that you're saying
okay
you go in a boat
yeah
and they give you these little raincoats
and then they take you right into all the mist from the falls and at one point you're like ten feet from one of the
Niagara Falls
wow
do you get we
yeah it's I don't know it seems like it's raining for a little bit but
no you're not you don't go under the falls
uh you think he'd be killed if he went under the falls
it depends who you were
I don't know it depends how you were built
okay
well
I don't know
so that's pretty neat
mhm
oh okay so went to Niagara Falls and
I
mhm and then we went home
okay
oh what did you do
we've went to the pond
and then the next day we went to the pond and then the day after that we went to the beach and
so you know just switched off between the pond and the beach doesn't mean anything we did we just went swimming all the time
oh
you're still doing tha
mm yeah
how long are you there for
we're leaving
well we're leaving for Baltimore in two days
oh so you'll be home for Shabbat
yeah
oh
I didn't know that okay
okay
now you do
hm
now you do
okay
oh guess what
what
I start school on next Thursday
what
because the high schools start earlier
so I have to start Thursday
Thursday
Thursday
not this week next week but still
oh next week
yeah
oh that's not so bad
no but
what's today so now it's so today it's the twenty first
yeah
hold on
oh
so what
yeah
yeah
mhm
you there
yeah
okay
it's the twenty first I start on the thirty first
mhm
hm I start September fifth
yeah so does middle school but
mhm
oh well
oh well
too bad
and we went on a Sunfish and it was really neat
eh eh and the wind was in the sail and
what is the difference between a Sunfish and a sail- what is a Sunfish
it's a little sailboat
really scrawny one
oh
how many people fit
about one and a half
one person can sit comfortably the other person can be
scrunched up and then if you want you can stuff a third person in
oh
which we did
ooh
and she sits like on the wrong side
with the boat leans over they just fall out
and well it has
and
big boats you know they usually have two sails or more
yeah
well a Sunfish is
it's really small and it has one sail
and it's really light
um I mean the sail was big
in proportion to the little tiny rest of the boat
yeah
so it goes really fast it's like
and that
and you know it can only carry two or three people as I told you
and it's it's fun
so which do you like better
um
I guess the Sunfish
okay
I bet
anything else
oh yeah we did go out on the big boat once also
ooh boy
last time I came up
0
are you doing anything exciting in the next few days
yep
what
we're leaving
besides that
we're leaving tomorrow
I mean we're leaving for Framingham tomorrow
where my cousins live and then we're staying there for the day and then we're leaving the next day
okay
like that so nothing much exciting
except for going out on the Sunfish today again
oh
just
um
yeah
you s- you sleep in the shed
no I don't
okay
but when my cousins just came up
yeah
they they all slept out in the shed
oh
and of course see Ella couldn't be left out
so she went and slept in the shed with him also
they all slept in the shed
alright
okay oh wait that's not it
okay
oh we also went biking a couple times
you know there's
there's a couple bike paths around here
where
oh yeah
and
you
yeah
and today we went to the aquarium
is it big eh
and wood salt no actually it's it's tiny
oh
and it's free
so you can
and it's it's kind of neat I mean you can go in and just
pick up all the things in there
one floor is devoted to
lobsters and crabs and
hermit crabs and starfish that you can pick up
and stuff you can touch
right
yeah until like you find something that
that isn't stressful or and not boring
yeah
that's the main two combinations righ
yeah
Not stressful and not boring
yeah
Well it's like I have no problems with secretarial work okay that's what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know eh
mm
y- you don't get bored because you are always doing something different
and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two if's there
mhm
but you get no respect I mean oh you're a secretary and the pay is pretty pretty crummy
about the well it's pretty much the same as as what I'm getting you know but
um depending upon where you work and all but you know it's like that's no answer either so
I've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed
But anyway ,
a- and you can think about that pregnancy thing
oh yeah that pregnancy thing yeah that do the
Maybe that's your there's your hormones calling
yeah well no the funny thing is it's like
ten years ago I would've said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby
you know but like at this point in time it's kind of like we're going to do it because if we don't do it
uh
eh you know in the next year or two we'd regret it
you know we we figure it's something we'd want to do it's not like we're doing it because we have to do it or there's peer pressure or well a little
mm
little peer pressure
oh no no no
I yea- I know exactly where you're at because I think about that too I got about like six or seven years
I figure my body is a very slow
yeah
maturer you know what I mean like I didn't get my period until I was sixteen I don't look
yeah mm
e- I mean I look like about uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am
and I'm just starting to get my period actually now /
yeah yeah
as an adult So I kind of figure well I must I I'm probably I'm probably good until at least some time in the early forties and I
could probably go a little longer than that I know there's a risk and all that bullshit
yeah
but yeah I think about that too because it's like I mean I I kind of like the way things are going in the in the total lack of responsibility
I know well I mean that's the thing kids are cute and all that and I was just we we
mm
slept until noon we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats
fell back to sleep okay I mean we're talking total slackers
mm
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid w- we couldn't do this you know and
mm
No you got to be focused on that and I wa- I mean there's a_lots of other things that
I mean as far as like living situation I I was feeling kind of settled you know like /
Right
I'm not going to be like
traipsing around but
I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe
y- yeah
ten years alright ev- even if I could project that far which I really can't
yeah
but I mean you got a kid you can't do fucking ten years w- /
I know
it's like cool I think I'll go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country
I know well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate so we'll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully /
mm
you know and then then there's four or five years doing the damn work and
mm
He's crazy he wants it that's fine he can do it no problem but that sort of ties us up here
although we like the place we're in no hurry to leave it
yeah
and that would be good
But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be
pretty darn good because /
mm
you know we're a- after after coming back from Spain from those two and half years
it wasn't so much an adjustment to the way things were it's just
asking the question gee do we really like
um the way things are over here with
the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing I mean I'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is
he you know he should be there by oh
oh well let's say eight thirty to nine
but yeah
he doesn't care when
well okay and his professor is
obviously uh a great person to work for so I'm I'm envious but um
whatever I'm you know I'm caught up
mm
in it and and I don't like it you know
too many days I'm I'm working and and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock and I'm thinking
mm
This is crazy you know in Spain we had this
break and you sat you talked to people you know you enjoyed your food you relaxed /
mm
you know
and it's a fairly productive nation right you know What's going on here xx
yeah you have to yeah
I mean you have to like look at like both ad- I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages
in what oth- ever place you're in /
mhm
and think about the disadvantages of the place that you're not in
yeah
Otherwise you go nuts righ
That's true , yeah
yeah
I know Laura tried to because we have email and and so she sent me a letter back saying
you know remember how crowded the transportation is and what else /
mm
how expensive everything is
and I- you know I remember those things of course you know /
And you work you know possibilities were a_lot more limited
True
and the language you know
yeah
constantly like kind of like I mean those could be p- considered positive things as well
yeah
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather than
mhm sure
They just like worrying over them
Well you know
and that's why I'm I I
it helps to have
kind_of a glimpse into the future righ
And that's how that's how we got to /
mm
Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers and it turned out that way because /
mm
we had this idea of and I I really feel that that's important and
so what I'm having an idea of now is
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate it takes about five or six years
we have the kid probably
we he gets a research position
somewhere in France or in Spain
and then we move over there and you know
I take care of the kid and and
do some you know little day labor whatever you know we'll see
mm
um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years and then we take it from there
yeah because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is is all so subject to
whatever change in the weather that happens to be righ
mhm
oh I know I know
And and it's like
you know what I think because I get like the same I get the same as you like some days it's just kind of like
you know what the hell am I doing not not with my life but ge- but I mean just what
yeah
you know like what like where do I get the animal to to just you know
to do anything you know I just lay in bed and dream for for the whole day easily
yeah
I know
Well
I I know I know what you're saying I I feel there's sort of a
a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because
for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house
mm
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said
is this what we really want to be worrying about right now and you know I realize no
yeah absolutely
and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future or I I know I have this tendency to do that
And miss the present completely I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan
yeah
yeah yeah
you know and e- each little I mean i-it's like as far as I'm concerned
there's like no pleasure that's as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about
the past but like when you're there in that moment
it's I mean everything else just kind of like it's almost like time doesn't exist
yeah
You know yeah
Well
I I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is
okay I get the late I get to work a little bit late which is common and they don't really care since I'm an hourly you know you have to be within a certain time frame
mm
and so everyone else is parked
I'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
and I you know I close the door I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day
and I hear the birds singing /
yeah
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds and that's that it sort of cheers me up it I you know I realize what a minute okay
in that nasty sterile office where the windows don't even open /
eh I will be for the next eight hours or so but out here there still is some life going on and just sort of cheers me up to know that
okay I can come back to it you know So that's that's
yeah in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all
There you are you and the birds you know
yeah
yeah yup hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know
oh yeah
And every once in a while when you know I can I can remember
just being back with people or or eating some place you know in Barcelona and
so it brings me back but
I still haven't gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
um
I'm like dying to go there
You mean the one right next to the apartment
yeah yeah yeah
Well it's not French it's just it's just gourmet it's gourmet Catalan /
oh it's not oh I thought it was Fre- ah really
yeah yeah
Well even better
Save it for save it for a special occasion you know and and you know you might need a reservation too yeah
yeah
I will
I should have some some visitors and my family's planning on coming this summer so I'll take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also
yeah yeah
Is the one over in Gracia that it's kind of on a corner I think I think I
uh
no there's a couple places in Gracia that I've been going to
uhhuh
But there's one in the Bario_Gottigo actually it's on the other side of Leotana
huh
Like down over by the Bornillo
okay
And it's got I've only been there I've only eaten there once alright but I've been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place
uhhuh
Actually you know I know where I'm going to go I have a friend my friend from England I don't remember if I I told you about her she's my my old roommate
mhm
From Oviato and she's coming she got a job down here she's coming on Friday to live
mhm
And ah I this is like the perfect because when we lived in Ovia- Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time that would be the f- perfect place to take her when she gets her
yeah
yeah
We- well I'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and and uh think that you wer- you were able to stay that was I was a little bit worried a- at first
you know that when you got back there because the th- the money would run out probably in April or so and you know
yeah
And I knew you know I knew I'd get a job right I I mean I knew I would get a job but
a- and I after I just stopped thinking about it I just started th- thought well fuck it I am going it's like inevitable and I'm I'm going to get some- I want something I have to get something and I will
uhhuh
um huh
But I didn't say I I just thought that you know I'll get a job and at this point if I get desperate I'll just have to take anything
yeah
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that's
Fairly sweet I mean eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice but I'm changing my attitude to the point where
I'm not going to get stressed out about it too much
I'm not going to try to change anything
Good
I'm going to go in there I'm going to do a nice job I'm going to have a good time
uhhuh
you know i- and I'm not going to I mean it's not the same I'm either like from working with kids I mean that was like you know my my career for like eight years
mhm
But this is you know more like
it's nice it's really nice
And you could
Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the
States or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some some place in Spain too with with l- ah
yeah
yeah , I don't have a big draw for it right now if anything like I would like to open a bi- I've always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant I mean it takes tons of money
yeah
yeah me too well well
But like I'd love to
That's why I want to win win the lottery first though because it's like you ha-
Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up but
well yeah well good and and so you're you're probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool Emory was telling me that so
yeah and I probably won't
yeah so
and now I'm I'm still trying to find somebody to
to to finishing teaching me
rolling I I I started to learn rolls last year and then
we ran out of weather before I could really get it
and this year I have
well rolling in a sea kayak
I don't even know anybody around here that rolls in sea kayak
oh yeah everybody I know rolls in sea kayaks
really
well no I shouldn't say that but
yeah I mean sea kayaking rolling in a sea kayak makes a lot of sense because
it's a hell of a lot more convenient to be able to roll your kayak back up again
oh yeah
than it is
to to have to get out and reenter
than get out and then get back in in the cold water
yeah
yeah so that's why I want to be able to do it I mean it's just
it's it's sort of knack you know you learn it in a couple of hours and then you got it
uhhuh
but it's it you know you got to get the the expertise and you got to do the practicing and stuff and
yeah
so far I haven't had anybody to teach me but I'm still working on it
but what I've done twice this summer is go
inflatable river kayaking
that's something else
in an inflatable raft
yeah
it's it's a one person inflatable kayak
that's wild
and it's just like a little mini raft that's shaped like a kayak
yeah
and there's no cockpit
yeah
it's all open
yeah
and it's self bailing
yeah right
so you can take it on class three waves
how does it self bail
well it
well
it's so shallow
the floor is not the floor is not attached to the sides
they're both inflated separately
oh
they're tied together
but what happens is because the floor is inflated
the whole thing rises up with you in it
and as it rises back up
the water seeks its own level so it goes out
yeah it bails out
yeah
yeah
but don't you have to be able to roll that
so it's just like a big
no people don't roll it
no
if you fall if you fall out
you just swim up to it and you clamp her back in
but if you're in white water and stuff you're going to be out of it more than you're going to be in it
well not in a class three
no
we don't do anything that's class four
oh okay
and
I think it's incredible what you do
it's really fun I mean it's just going through big waves and having to maneuver around rocks and and stuff
yes
we went through one
one rapid that was maybe class three plus
half the people made it and half didn't I made it one day and then the next day I didn't make it
and it's just a big wave you get washed out of the boat
mhm
mhm
but we had it's really been fun
well
is and what is this called again
this is called this is river kayaking with an inflatable kayak
right
I see
it's just like a raft
wow
just to let you know that hard hypolon
yeah
rafts
like zodiacs
that the big rafts yeah
yeah
and
you know it has it has an inflated seat in it you just and you have a regular kayak oar paddle
and it's it's just really a blast because everybody can do it
mhm
you don't have to have any river kayaking skill
uhhuh
mhm
you know because river kayaks are tippy
oh yeah they were really
oh
and you know and you're locked into a cockpit and there's you know what you got to know what you're doing
yes yes
yeah
with this beginners have a blast
uhhuh
so we just have you know
about two weeks ago I met about ten friends
at this campground
up on the Trinity river not that far from forest Glenn where I used to live
this is the middle fork of the Trinity and I used to live on the south fork
and we camped at the campground and the next day we did our own shuttle we went up
and we we probably
it was probably about three four hours down the river back to the campground
and it was just we took a lunch and it was just gorgeous
you know and
mhm
yeah it was it was a blast
so we you know I've been doing that a little bit and that's that's fun
mhm
but I want to get more into sea kayaking too
I haven't
what yeah you got a good place down there sea kayaking is good good

yeah
aw the one perfect woman
oh yeah

I hope
I hope we keep dropping our expectations of perfection
yeah well that might help
yes
that's true
and I'm well aware that it might help
well I think it it doesn't need perfection it just needs to click
exactly yeah exactly
I can't believe it
I know it's so soon yeah
that's so exciting , and you and when do you take off from work
well I'll work right up to the end if I can

but yeah , baby is due October first
is she coming by herself
yeah well yeah
oh good , that's nice
yeah
my god , if she came with don , that would be like
that'll be good
the horror of horrors are you kidding
I know
like the last person I want my baby to imprint on
he wouldn't even hold it
I know no I doubt it
I mean , no it wouldn't be the kind of thing , that , I mean he would just have a miserable time
oh this would be a great time , even Norman ,
yeah
Norman will be sort of superfluous dad
yes well Norman has to work
at the woman's
so he's not going to get to
Norman has to work , he's not going to get time off work
oh yeah how's it going with work
it's going fine , you know things are going well for both of us , I did he have a job the last time we talked I don't know
I don't think so
yeah , well he's finishing up his dissertation , he'll finish it next month
uhhuh
and he got a job , so it's only a six /
month thing but you know , if they like him it'll go into a full time position
you're starting to sound Canadian
I know , it's terrible isn't it
oh my god
well at least I don't
say out , out , out and about
out
he would what they all say
oh
god
I know , but not only that , when I speak french ,
which I hardly ever do , but occasionally I do
when I speak french , I have a french Canadian accent as opposed
to it
god
a normal french accent which is
kind of weird , like this person from the states having a french Canadian accent
you're , it's not popular to be french now anyway , so
oh well the french Canadian is /
completely different than
oh completely different is
french , oh yeah , it's not even
yes things are very upsetting over here right now
yeah , I know , norm sent
what specific thing
norm actually sent some letters to green to the french embassy here in here in Canada
fantastic
yeah
no things have been , have not been happy about any of that at all
yeah
so time will tell we'll see what happens
uhhuh
but , yeah , otherwise things are going really well , did you see Tyson my goodness
he's sitting here in his caca right now with his little
stuffed animal and he's waiting to be pushed around
that's one of the things you're going to have to do , is just heaps of exercise
is he
when they're a little bit older
has he ever made any words yet
is he saying any words yet
oh actually I was just in the middle if a sneeze at the same time as an oh wait
that was a big one
, actually he's saying a lot of words he's not he isn't saying any sentences yet
uhhuh
but he might
is he saying like two
two words
yes so
yeah they're sort of saying
bye bye ma ma or
choo choo train
yeah
no that that's always a recent one , choo choo he usually just says choo choo for train and now he just started saying choo choo train
uhhuh
and
he's so funny , he has this stuffed animal , that my mother had given him , it's this little
soft cuddly
almost like a windbreaker sort of material
mhm
and , he calls it Tyson
and everywhere he goes now , he has to have this Tyson with him
oh you have it when your mom comes to visit she'll be so thrilled
oh I know I know
yeah
listen , I think it's great it's really , it's so cute
yeah
and he just loves it , he has to sleep with it and he , it's just it's the first time he's really attached a lot of attachment
a lot of
it's well I guess attachment to something
uhhuh
and , what else is he doing
oh I took him to , it was so funny
I took him to a birthday party yesterday , it was his first birthday party I was looking forward to it all week actually for two weeks now I've been looking forward to it Sophia , aw his first
birthday party that he's been invited to
so excited next door neighbor right , bring Tyson over , screamed
wah cried the whole time
he's miserable ,
I had to bring him in the backyard ,
soon as I brought him in the backyard
funny
oh it was so funny
he wouldn't hang out with the kids well so , it was a bit
there wasn't any chairs for him either , there was no chairs
he had to bring his own high chair
there he is , sitting in his high chair , all the kids are sitting in regular chairs , oh because it's an older kid too , he's five years old
oh , okay
so
but Tyson just , as soon as I walked in
screaming wah
daddy , daddy
cry cry cry cry cry
so I brought him in the backyard , they have a cubby house with a little sandpit under it
uhhuh
so he played there with his , with trucks for so long , he loved that , and he finally sort of calmed down
, and then later on , the kids were playing a game in the backyard with balloons , and then the balloons started popping , and he did the same thing
wah
miserable , cry cry cry cry
well we got to go , bye
things to look forward to ,
uh , well that's not , he he , you know that they they hire back a_lot of their people who ah , graduate there that's because they got a_lot of money in the bank
yeah
and , there that's the only university that does that
yeah , but I mean the fact that he he actually did get an academic position , that that's ah , because all those people who went off all sort of bright eyed ,
now there's another guy who went ah down to U S C uh
yeah , the only , the only person I know who made it for literature was a guy name McCan who might be at Cornell
yeah , he's still around , I've seen his name pop up here and
yeah , but Ramses' vanished
uh , he's supposed to be in Japan from what I've heard but he , you know , he he fell into a trap uh , he could never get tenure
yeah , well he was at Columbia and ah
yeah , well he was , he was there for like five years and they turned him down for tenure then he went somewhere else , he was down in College Park Maryland
yeah
and ah , he was I think he was only ah non tenure track down there there is supposedly supposed to be back in Japan now
yeah
but you know , he's a he's probably you know become an English teacher at some univ-
yeah
I know a guy , believe it or not , I knew a guy from Manhattan who's up in Sapporo , his /
uhhuh
major , he w- did an M B A
uh , believe it or not , he's an he's an English teacher now
huh
he got a a sort of well it they don't really have tenure , you know , foreigners don't have tenure in Japan , but you know , it sort of like a long term teaching position
yeah
uh , you know , after I taught at that university and I don't in a way I don't envy him
yeah
no , the E S L people are are second class citizens
I I well , you should see what the Japanese students
after they torture them for six years in middle school and high school they don't want to do anything in college particular-
yeah , oh , you see the Korean students are the same way no it it doing the teaching at Rutgers are are are Koreans and Japanese are not leading the class by /
by any means
yeah , well they they you know , they want to relax for a couple of years and
try , try , giving some lectures about um , you know , it's it's great you brought your body to class , but you must remain conscious
well they biggest problem I had was trying not to flunk them , I had to I had to recycle the same questions two or three times to get them to pass
um
but to have , humiliating for the teacher you know , just
yeah
you know , I I I told my friend who had taught there , you_know I said well you know I I gave them the questions once , and I you_know , two thirds of them failed ,
so I gave them the same questions , almost all the same questions again , and they said
and half of them failed , so sometimes you have to give them the same questions three times
, yeah , yeah , that's that's a-
ah , you know , you know , that kind of teaching position I can live without
yeah
as a matter of fact , I've got , I've got a couple good possibilities now I told you
mhm
uh , one is ah you know doing media type ventures
mhm
and I'm negotiating with them
yeah
and there's this ah , computer thing
hm
ah , coming up in march , and believe it or not , they want me to be the president
huh
of the company
well you can be the next ah , Bill Gates
excuse m
you'll be the the next Bill Gates
wow , you know when you start talking about C E O you get all sorts of privileges with that you know , like a car , driver you know , house
yeah
big ah , you know , big fat salary , so
well we'll look forward to ah , Cyrilsoft ninety seven
no it's actually the ah , it's this that that remember about that new operating system I was telling you about that's in Japa
o , no
uh , well I I told you that several months ago
uhhuh
uh , and they're going to they're going to Koreanize it
oh , yeah
so there's a ne-
there are , I I was looking at a Korean ah American bulletin board , and there is some sort of Korean system out that's been developed in the States I don't know what
no , no this this is the professor who developed this one is
yeah
uh , the one in the States is probably to work on Unix or something you know the ah its a it's difficult to send messages in Korean across the internet
yeah
and I've got a copy of you know that ah Yudora for English
yeah
uh , but I can't you know people try to send me foreign language messages and get all these nonsense characters on my screen
well , well there are yeah , well there are some ah , there is some going on , because ah some of the on the Korean bulletin board , some of the messages you pick it up and get just
you know , it what amounts to code , it looks like ah the Rutgers system is ah , I only discovered that there's certain unmarked computers that will receive pictures and if
they don't receive pictures , and you either get a message that we can't accept this or instead of um , instead of a picture you'll get alphabet and numbers , you know its sort of over and over again
yeah , mhm
and ah some of the Korean messages have been like that and and ah , apparently they're they're not pornographic , they're just um it's it's the ah
you could probably decode it if you could you know , work out the , sit down and work out the pattern but ah
there is , they are , sending some kind , the Korean Americans are using some kind of system here
yeah , they probably dual serve , anyway this , this , new thing is for that architecture my friend in Tokyo did
mhm
he didn't command the legs , hu
mhm
sometimes not as much as he would like to be , but
he's doing really good
and he's Now I think that he's got kind of control
uhhuh
he's much sweeter
uhhuh
yeah , he seems to be have a , well I mean he was sweet before , but
well , it's a frustrating process to be always falling down , hu
yeah , and now he's usually better now he's pretty fussy but oi
yeah
so , how have you bee
work and Elizabet
and
yeah , that was a hard trip
uh , she's not at all well , matter of fact
I wouldn't be surprised to get a phone call anytime
oh , reall
yeah , she was wanting to die while we were there
really
yeah , she's had her fourth stroke and
oh gosh
there's a_lot_of pain on her left side , and she can't walk without a walker , and she can't go but a few steps , and
mm
so she lives on the in a chair and on couch and back in her hospital bed , right there within a few feet of each other
mm
and a she's so used to being , you know up and busy , and in control , and able to do and
and she can'
no
so she's finishing her autobiography and then
uh
wanting to die , but not , not lifting off , so she's pretty angry and irritable
wondering what's the hold up
yeah
but her mother died ah , f- , four years after having a stroke , so
oh yea
yeah , so
she's not , not supposed to die yet , evidently
yeah , it's not time well , that's
a rough trip , but
yeah , but Laura was able to help her with the book a bit , you know by her sort of secretly wanting her to read it
and tell what sections are where and
and I was packing up things for her to send to people she wants to , you_know , things for her family and things
oh yeah
it was kind_of a hard and sad trip , in that way , but we went ah , she sent us off to Sonoma one day , we went up to Sonoma
and that's nice
uhhuh
we just
aw
we were so wretched hot , we just sort of stayed in the car and drove
Drove off to the sights , you kno
yeah , I can't imagine how hot it would be
yeah
but still I looked on the , least last night still didn't , a hundred down there
uhhuh
so it's been ah
ninety or a hundred for a month now down there
jeez
down there
and it's been , today and yesterday was the first day in a long time that we've had it less than a hundred , or ninety
and so it's in the eighties and it feel marvelous
wow
and so we finally get some relief from the weather
it's like autumn here
I mean ,
is that righ
yeah , it's about fifty , fifty five
yeah , that's right , you're all ready , you've got a short summer , huh , so it's all ready
yeah
moving into it , yeah
yeah , and it smells and it feels like autumn
is that righ
, yeah , it has for about a week or so
getting a little , getting a little crisp hu
mhm
yeah , shorts weather is definitely gone , I don't know if it ever really came
I was waiting wait a second , what's going on
well I'm a Finnish T V star
are yo
yeah ,
you were on T V
well , I'm going to be
oh you are
I did the filming on , last Thursday
Alexia are you oka
and , um , it's kind_of a cultural show ,
uhhuh , inter /
to
view the American
yeah , and we do like little skits on like how um , Americans react to things differently than other cultures , and
oh , neat
Finnish culture , so we like do the subway scene of Americans in the subway , and Finns in the subway
they're pretty funny
I'll bet that was fun , hu
yeah , I think it'll be pretty interesting it doesn't air starting until January fifteenth , but
it's pretty fun I think , because they had French , and German , and Asian , and
I'll be interested to see how they put it all together
yeah
um , yeah , see how it ends up , so
, so will will it be in Finnish , or
no
well we spoke in English , but it's like a Finnish documentary
it's a Finnish documentary but it has all these sections to i
yeah
yeah , neat
yeah , like different parts of movies and stuff , so we're , I'm going to see if I can get my American friend to tape it
neat
Yammi and I are saving up for one of those V C R 's that have the mode , so maybe by then we'll have one , we can tape it and
yes
it seems interesting what they're doing , so
yeah , so it'll be a cross culture center hu
yeah , and they're paying me so , it's like
is that righ
yeah , I thought it's pretty nice
yeah
pays to be a foreigner sometimes , I guess
not all the time , but sometimes
yeah , right
so that's what we've been doing here , just kind of Yammi's been taking a few days off while I go and
oh so it was a , not just a little thing then , huh
well , it was just a couple times just went a couple times and
oh
uhhuh
then if they want to use me later or something they'll call
oh neat
yeah , but it's pretty fun neither of us could act
well , was it like a Helsinki station o
no it's a Finnish station
oh
on T V one and
hm
so it's
just for the Alexi honey , come here sweetie
he got , he got the door shut , and he's kind of cranky now
do you want to get hi
yeah , hold on , just a second
0
okay I forgot it's free , so you don't have to
, that's right
we were worried so much
mhm
about it , but
you wou- you would've love this house we saw honey
oh yeah
it was unbelievable
Frank Lloyd Wright's hu
yeah
aw
it , it would be nice to live in now , you know
yea
and it was built in nineteen oh two
and it's probably modern looking
yeah
as it would seem to me
yeah , yeah , it was just gorgeous
aw
and that glass , in extraordinary art glass throughout , in the the ah , chandeliers in the dining room were butterfly design and
oh wow
there were butterfly designs in the door coming in
and just , just gorgeous
wow
built for sixty thousand dollars
really
back in nineteen oh two
yeah , a while back I think
wow
it would have been nice to see
I I really enjoy that calendar
yeah
you guys sent , the Frank Lloyd Wright calendar
yeah
looking at it , I like it
a_lot_of people have made comments about who's this , you know , who did thi
hm
coolest Frank_Lloyd_Wright
but yeah , I looked into a masters' program here
yeah
in and
they cost seventy thousand marks a year
huh
so that's like wha
twenty four thousand or somethin
you're kidding
no
I thought , whoa
that's pretty steep considering all the other education's free here , yeah
yeah , so what's what's the dea
well , it's especially for /
private school
well no but it they , don't have masters program
does kind of , it's new , starting out this year and it's
designed to fit the States' idea of undergrad and masters program , you know
uh
so , I'm going to see about trying to just get into the regular
school , and trying to continue like maybe next year or something , but
yeah
so being a Finnish citizen , or being married to a Finnish citizen doesn't help you in that way , that
well not for that masters program it doesn't but for just going , if I wanted just to take classes
to receive a Finnish degree , which is equivalent to a masters
Alexi come here hold on dad , I'm sorry
okay
0
okay , sorry
hey , mister Alexi
nap time
he's getting kind_of cranky , I'll let him bang on the keyboard a little bit , but
I'm going to take a Finnish course and see how that goes
well that's probably the next step anyway , isn't i
yeah
get good at your Finnish , huh
for me , mhm
and I'm so it'll be nice , get started and
see how that goes then , um , I tried to send you guys cards ,
couple weeks ago , and realized that I didn't have your address
oh , you want to write it dow
yeah
what is i
fifty one fifty eight
Hawthorn Drive
Hawthorn Drive , okay
that's four six two two six isn't i
two two six
six
okay , thanks
Because
we had it all ready , and then
went to look , and I was like I have their phone number , and that's it
so
I bought you a little coffee cup from Tullyesa and I still haven't gotten it in the mail , so
You'd never know it though she was a workaholic and really a very uh very very attractive woman you know
but but anyway so what else it new you know
well let's see our construction has started
oh yeah how's how's that problem you had with the
and
that's solved now expensive but it was solved
it was eh yeah I know you were telling me
so very expensive
yeah hm
involving a tremendous amount of money but it's solved and
yeah
but you were thinking of suing the person at the
well
the cost of suing eh you know i- it's muddy lawyers seem think it's not really
what was it
you know eh if it's not
not not very happy about doing
oh
oh really
ho- how you making out with your ex-law- your la-
oh my case uh he's trying to my lawyer is trying to get
Bill's lawyer to get together with a lawyer for Index Futures and see if they can come up with a settlement
mhm
but so far no he says typically settlements are like on the very last day
you know on the you're sitting on the steps waiting for the judge and that's when they settle you know
yeah whe- when when when you going to cour
but in a
uh well it he thinks it's going to be postponed originally I was telling you it was October sixteenth
mhm
now he thinks it
more than likely it won't be till sometime in the middle of December
oh jesus
so try to keep a date open we'll I'll we'll try to let you know what the date is because he he he really would prefer to either have you there otherwise he'll videotape you
yeah
uh but now he's he's thinking it'll probably be delayed till
I don't know he it's not delayed yet but the but he but the brokerage house isn't answering the questions he asks
does he is he still as confident as ever that there will be some sort of a
well he's no he's very confident that we'll win against Phil
a meaningful settlement
but he's not
sure that we'll win against Index Futures because he said there's it's as far as he could see there's no real precedent for that
mhm
in the next for this particular case he there's no precedent
but Phil's lawyer was probing around saying well what do you really want
you know so he said
see we don't want to settle with Phil's lawyer
prior to settling with Index Futures
you know what I mean
oh it seems Index Futures is deep pocket
yeah yeah so he doesn't want to settle with him first so he said to Phil's lawyer he said why don't you go
get together with Index Futures though by the way they got a new lawyer they went outside now they're not using their own lawyer
oh is that right
they went outside to another firm in Chicago
and so he said to him go get together with him and see what you guys can come up with you know
in the meantime they're bringing in two experts so we got to bring in an expert too that's going to cost a few thousand dollars
jesus
the expert is to say see their
you have to p- do you have to pay that or does that come out of the settlement
eh I pay the expenses
hm
so the expert
Jesus how much you got in this thing already must be like ten thousand dollars in already I'll bet
well not not much no not so much thirty five hundred for him
the lawyer
mm
eh so far in expenses maybe
maybe fifteen hundred so far
oh that's not bad
but the but the the big expense would be this expert
the ex- we got to fly him in from Chicago probably
put him up overnight and pay him
how do you how do you find an expert like that Ani
I don't know he's going to find him he asked me if I knew anyone I didn't
uh because there's no commodity of experts in Philly
most of them are in Chicago
uh possibly New_York or Washington
mhm
but mostly Chicago
eh anyway he said he'll try to find one and actually he wants someone who works for a commodities firm
and there's a possibility they're all in_cahoots together you know they don't tes-
yeah that's that's I was just thinking the exact same
that they don't testify against each other
yeah that's what had
but
but see they're bringing in two experts to say that it's common
business practice to give those
they admit that they gave Phil those internal printouts
but they said it's common business practice to give them to substantial customers
but on the one hand they're arguing that Phil
oh I'm sorry Bernice Bernice told me
Bernice says tell me that she can get that program with
that girl on it
oh you can
yes
it's on Life yeah so Jessica Savage it's on eight to ten and then I think an hour after that is a documentary
yeah
very she must be pretty famous person
well she was
how old was sh- how old was she she when she died
huh
oh she was
I don't know she was probably in her forties or something
is that right ohgod what a shame
fifties maybe
but but anyway she she was already you know big time she was with a network she was with N B C
yeah
she had gone off the local news on to the
oh so she really made the big time then
yeah and then she died she was in a restaurant which we've been to in New Hope you know not far
and
it's actually very tricky we we u-
when when I heard about the accident I realized that it could easily happen
there was a
oh I forget what it was there was a very tricky turn when you leave the restaurant
and they failed to make that turn and I think I forget exactly how th-
she died as a result of it you know
yeah
but but I remember that too and I said you know I always get got confused when I left that restaurant that you could
easily make a bad turn
but anyway
I guess it was her boyfriend that was driving and I don't u- I can't remember the details anymore but they that's how she got killed
hm
you know
but anyway you had to be there for fifteen minutes because that'll it because it's going to go on in about three minutes
so if you wanted to see it you know
yeah if oh well in fifteen minutes we got to be on in fifteen minutes
yeah yeah
we're on we're on
so what else is new so you getting ready for right
yeah oh yeah
yeah we sent ours I sent it in we ha- we have to make
we we still didn't make the reservations with a
hotel we have to do that
oh yeah that's where we're going to stay also but
yeah and I don't know let's see what else is new Pearl is not too well
ohgod isn't that ohgod that's such a
yeah she she's not too well
ohgod
and we s- we spoke to Jackie last week
she won her case you know in the
you know she's getting out of London
unemployment
Judy won hers too but the guy
is appealing it
hm
he's what
she Judy had also won her case for unemployment but they're appealing it the the firm is appealing it
I'll be a son of a bitch are they really
but in the mean-
yeah but in the meantime Judy got a job so they're only talking about
like six weeks worth of checks you know
yeah tell me let me ask you a question does she have hospitalization this new job
I don-
eh
yeah but they so far they haven't specifically told her what she gets she has to pay for part of it which is typical nowadays
yeah
most companies don't give you full hospitalization anymore
yeah we do but we're going to start changing too it's eh it's getting so damn expensive
yeah
most companies are making the employees pick up
uh you know up to half of it for whatever
and I just finished you know remember I I got a one time job with a f-
yeah Bernice was telling me
stayed at Delaware
and they were tr- real nice I enjoyed every every minute of it and I I went up there and turned it over to them
last Thursday
great
and then they're going to call in the
they're going to call me in for a review
uh
and I I it depends how the review goes I don't know who's going to be there to go over it with me
they so typically they make you redo some of it you know or whatever they make you
spend more time on it
but that was ni- that was real nice I enjoyed it and
and it was nice money for the time spent yeah
so far I haven't received the money but I you know I think
I think I don't have any fears about that you know
oh that's great yeah if that that if you get a few more of those they
yeah
yeah oh jeez a couple
what you do it where did you work to do it
at home
at home
I own my own computer
eh it was real nice I mean I really well mostly it wasn't even computer work it was mostly just my thoughts getting my thoughts out it was something I had done
before at M C I and at Western Union
and my friends eh
that said that's what they wanted and so I you know it was something I felt very comfortable with
and I already did the
the project and I mean eh eh they just wanted the specification for someone else to program it and I I wrote up the specification I drew up
oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts
hm
which isn't exactly what he wanted but that's like old fashioned flow chart but the guy
the guy that I ga- gave turned it over to he just had me spend an afternoon explaining it to him
and he didn't seem opposed to the way I did it
and my friend said he's the fussiest guy I'd have to worry about
but he seemed okay
so now it's just a few other managers there they're going to you know get together probably have me back again and explain it again
yeah
tell me what's happened to Gary in his interviews
oh we're real hopeful he tomorrow we probably will find out more he has two
potential jo- potential teach- teaching jobs
oh good
One is
Pleasantville New Jersey which we're not too happy about because it's black and it's very rough
but they're the ones who called him back
for a second interview
and they said it was narrowed down to four people
mhm
well so he has a one out of four chance I guess
but
the the town is all black you know it's near Atlantic City
and it's no-
what town is it
it's Pleasantville New Jersey it's all
oh yeah suresure that's black
it's it's it's all black and it
is that right
it's it's tough it's a tough school
so
It would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn't necessarily live there but I on the other hand it may not be great experie- the other one is Edison New Jersey but they
what we don't like about that is that's a nicer area probably but uh and it's only a couple hours from here
he'd have to relocate either way
but Edison
the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about a permanent position
then he's saying well they're trying to get rid of one teacher they have and if they're not able to get rid of that teacher
he would be more of a long term sub on per diem
hm
so he changed the story from a first time to the second time
anyway he's supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow
and
if he gets the
I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it
because it is a regular
fulltime job even though it might not be the great the great school
but it depends what they come back with at Edison too so tomorrow he's suppos-
but a- also it seems to me if you can survive the Pleasantville job
you'd certainly a great uh on your resume
yeah eh yeah that he was a full that he was a fulltime teacher
sure
and anytime he can look for others everybody in the school is black everybody they were interviewing were black the principal is black
really
eh yeah it's it's like a
eh it's just about a totally black community now
no kidding
and anyway the more he hears about the community the more he hears it's not so great it's not
not as bad as the big city black areas but it's
well you said he's not going to live in Pleasantville
no no he could live
you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in Egg Harbor or uh
you know it could be
do we dr- do we drive through Pleasantville driving down to Atlantic City Philadel-
yeah well if you take the Black Horse Pike you're passing right through Pleasantville
oh that's wonderful now , is Virgil finally retired also or
well , he retired from the university you know he but he's been working up at the base and
oh yeah
he's still working up there
is he
the base has closed but he's with the base conversion agency
and they expect that to go on for about one more year although
all the buildings now are occupied I think except one he said it it's gone really much faster than they thought
so but they have clean up to do and
transfer deeds and everything so he said it looks like it's going to take about one more year
to wind everything up
well , I hope they know what they're doing
I know it's really sad you know to because that was such a nice base
yeah well that's the way it is out here the ones are closing and just hope we don't need them again
I know it's it's kind of scary in a way but
yeah it is
I don't know and it's costing so much to you know put it back so that they can sell it you know they have to do so much clean up
to the soil and everything it is just a lot of expense
yeah mhm
yeah it is
but
so how's your family
he's great yeah so far as I know
where's john , now
he's still in Ohio he was home for about three weeks in august
he came home the first of august and was here till the twentieth
is he married now
no no oh he's still working on that p_h_d he just has his dissertation to write it's his
kind of up to him now how long he spends doing that , you know
uhhuh what's he studying or what's he
he's psychology counselling yeah he's working
psychology
well it that's that's a long haul
he's counselling you know he's counselling at the college level and he likes that
uhhuh
but he doesn't know what there will be available or what he really wants to do when he finally gets the p_h_d
which he hopes to have within the next year
oh I'm sure he'll he'll find something that has a need for that I think
yeah I think so and he's pretty sensitive and I think he'll do a pretty good job
mhm
oh
and how is Karen is she teaching this year
oh yes she's like you she's ready to retire
well you know the way the way education has gotten , I I don't know how a teacher can last until retirement age now
it's just that it's it's not fun anymore
unhunh it isn't
she said that all the teachers complain the same they work harder and harder all the time and
every year it gets it more and more demands are put on you
oh
and the kids are getting worse too there's just so much seems like hostility and anger
and and then the the parents some of them expect so much
oh
that you know you've got thirty five kids in a classroom you can't give each child the individual attention that the
no
parents thinks their child should have you can't do it
I know
they don't have teacher's aids anymore , so they just can't
and she's got thirty five , wow
yeah and and no aid you know you just you
that's ridiculous well , what they're doing here now no I don't know whether they're doing that in California or not they're putting all the special Ed kids back into the classroom
they're doing a lot of that , too
I mean we at Franklin last year which is a middle school we had a student that could hardly speak probably a hundred words and yet she was in the
regular classroom , making straight a
oh no
oh no
I mean she
it just doesn't make sense
unhunh no
I just I don't know what we can do about it
I don't either
they could just keep saying there's not money enough you know and the funds aren't there
but now this this child had her personal aid that went with her all day long
but you know I I I just have well that's one reason I quit teaching is because
well I mean main reason I quit was because I was just tired and ready to do something else but
even if I had been ten years younger
You know people have gotten out of Japan more
uhhuh but you're talking big city Chiba though
You're talking commercial , David
mm yeah but fun yeah
yeah
yeah big city
I like the big city
yeah well wh- wh- why did you take the prefecture that they gave you the
uh well there was only one choice at the time I interviewed
oh reall
yeah
uhhuh
Where it's like what you're doing
You have m- you're you have time and
Right
You can pick and choose more and you should definitely get a job with an air conditioner in your apartment
well how will I know that , Davi
You You ask Therese
an-
Is there an apar- air conditioner in my apartmen
say just David said that it's very hot in the summer
Right
and if there's not an air conditioner say sorry I'm I'm not
ple- please you know she's going to you- you're
interviewing so far in advance that
She's going to work with me , hu
yeah
She'll work with you on that
huh
All right
You don't have a roommate , righ
No It's all single apartments
uhhuh
So that's good
And how big is your apartmen
As big as the room that you had her
uh bit a little bigger than that
and then you have the kitchen off to the side
yeah
yeah great
First floo
I'm on the second floor
second floor
okay
You don't have a problem with w- with bringing girls back to your apartment or anythin
No there's no no nobody here like that to watch over
I me- I mean I got a letter from several Indonesian schools and and they explicitly say
hey look , no females
oh yeah
I told you that , righ
Didn't I read you tha
Loo- No but that's Indonesia
yeah I read the addendum to you
Well I I got a job offer from Indonesia
And they went okay just sign the papers we lo- we'd love to have you
Come on out
Noproblems
by the way , here's an addendum
Some of our teachers have complained about the following things in the past
hm
and and they wanted to list like six of them
One six thirty A
M
classes , two
um the the fact that
that the school holds your passport the entire time that you're working for them
ah
Three the fact that you're not allowed to have opposite members of the sex in your room
ah and they just listed like six things that were like holy cow where am I
and like no one would want to go
You well and a- apparently that's what was happening
They were like hiring these people
These people were getting over there on these false pretenses
saying oh yeah I want to teach in Indonesia
It's going to be great
and then and then having all these rules and regulations thrown on them
mm
That a a apparently they were signing year contracts and lasting like a month
Right
and so so they finally put this addendum into their contract and said hey look
Let's let you know about this ahead of time because
We're tired of you know bringing people over and having them quit on us
hm
But yeah
It's not going to change
But it's not going to change
Rob , I mean no one's going to go now going to go now
Sorry
No one will go
Exa- well yeah I'm sure people will still David there's people out there that are teaching English for free
yeah
There's people that will go to that will go to Indonesia go oh yeah Bali ho , let's go
yeah
I mean you
Sure the Mormon Church , too
yeah you've got David you must have you must have
You must have a hundred schools in Japan alone
People are working for free
I mean I just saw a couple of advertisements already in one of this magazines I get
called Transitions Abroad
Volunteers wanted for Japan
hm
They're booked solid
Christian programs
Mormon programs , Y M C A programs
like Y M C A P
They're taking volun- hu
Y M C A P
I don't know what it is
yeah
But but they're taking people by the bundles
and they're just they're just giving them a visa and then a place to stay , you know a dorm room and they're eating it up
hm well
They are eat-
They're probably going in the poor house , too
Well , yeah
Because it's expensive here
Sure sure you even you even got some people that are paying , David
There's an organization called Worldteach
People are paying to teach English
yeah
They're paying a thousand dollars
yeah I don't get that
I don't get
I don't understand that
I don't enjoy teaching that much
No they got to pay me to teach
yeah these people are paying
Anyway yeah that's about it
I mean I'm I'm going over there and I'm going to be looking
You know what I can't believe Davi
I cannot believe
hm
Nobody from South America and nobody from Europe wrote back and said hey , Mister_Brilly at least you're a schmuck
We don't want you
They didn't even have the balls to write me back
Got it down east Europe
hu
Poland , Hungary
I didn't apply to Poland , Hungary or Bulgaria
I think I
Poland and Hungary are the places you can get work easiest
Sure but David comeon let's be realistic
It's like five thousand dollars a year
Right an- and who the heck wants to live in Poland or Czechoslovakia
Well could could you enroll in two other courses if you wanted t
In addition to the one you're already in , are there two other things that you'd also like to tak
For example
I don't know what the limit is for
I know there's a limit for
students who e-
uh a limit for wha
You know I'm thinking a_lot about this job that I just took that
you know you seem to think is a dead end and obviously doesn't make enough money and you know I don't know I'm going to like it
You don't know that going into a job
There's
I understand that
Well tha-
I understand that
You've taken it and that's a
I feel like I just made a big mistake
Liz I can't tell you whether you did or not
It just feels lousy
And I just tried for the longest time to figure out what to do
Liz , Liz , I don't know whether you made a mistake or not
I can't possibly tell
And I
and I d- I don't even have enough information to say whether you did or not
And you will find out
And if it's a b- huge mistake you'll just quit , that's all
You have no way of knowing
Did you tell the public health people that you definitely don't want that jo
No I didn't tell them anything
oh okay
Is that e- is that really such an awful jo
Sounded to me like a_lot_of interesting things
Sounded to me like too much but it sounded like a very interesting
set of things
Is that something you definitely d- would not want to d
You had said that was an eas-
I
You had said you had said that was an easier job in some ways
Wha
Actually I don't think so anymore because I think that it's too many things
Are y- are you going to have to for either one of them are you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that you actually get paid fo
I I don't know yet
Because I don't think that that would be warranted /
at at at the salary that they're giving you
I I think that you ought to be able to circumscribe your hours very carefully
I just got this call yesterday from this I mean I j-
Liz
it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this
nurse at a high school
nearby
saying I should call her about openings in the district that she called me because
of one of the letters I wrote to one of the principals
oh yea
who knows what kinds of openings there are
mhm
mhm
So may-
Lizzy I know how up in the a- you know when I was in graduate school I I spent a_lot_of time in my last year of c- college
thinking about whether w- wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to teach little kids
And
I I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go into biophysics but also have my own little kids
But I went into biophysics
By the end of the year I'd met Daddy and I decided that was going to be it
I really wanted to
i- I really Daddy was really going to be the one
I got
very unhappy with the science
and
I just walked out of one lab and I said no this is it
I just don't want it
I wanted to be teaching little kids
Because Daddy was at that point noncommittal
to say the least
And and he was also leaving for Syracuse
And so a friend of mine sat down with me , Wayne Meyers and he said he was a very bright
guy
He was the one I cried whose shoulder I cried on when I took Dexadrin that time too for
the doctor had given it to me for cramps and I
ended up getting depressed for twenty four hours
um
and
he said to me
you really want to change
I said yeah I really want to go
He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon
because I had already applied and been accepted to the I mean it went so far that I w- I applied both to biophysics
and to Harvard School of Ed
And I didn't apply to any other ed schools because I figured I could get in in there which I had
And I went across the river that day
and I said can I get into your next year's class
And they said absolutely
And I mean by then it was like May
Certainly April
Certainly April not
not not earlier
And
I remember Mama Sadie was upset about it
But everybody knew why I was doing it and everybody kn- e- it was obvious even to Daddy why I I just had to
I had to do that for a while
I couldn't just study science for a while
And
I was twenty two
twenty one
And and
yeah I guess I was twenty two already
um and
a- and
and a- a- it's it's not any rational kind of thing Liz
It's hormonal
It's absolutely hormonal
I mean here you are , you are thirty
And it's no wonder
it's no wonder that that that you don't know what you want to do
I didn't know what I wanted to do at that stage
Well I did but it was out of reach
And for you it's obviously out of reach too
Unless it works out with Matt
you haven't met him
And therefore
I'm I'm
I I
I I'm disappointed in how you're going about it
because I don't see I don't see I mean
I I I I I've I've known so many people who didn't get married and so many people who got married too late to have children
It's very
sad
I find it very sad
I didn't expect that I would be in this position
with my children
Well
actually I expected it with Jonathan
I expected to worry about him not you
because he was very slow socially
And and and you know you never can tell with life
There aren't any rules about it
and th- nobody has nobody has written the future
And it's not really it's it's eh prayer and
eh penitence doesn't really help
It's going to happen , things are going to happen when it happen they happen
But you have to there there are ways to help them along
There are ways to help them along
And maybe you're doing them but I don't see it
I know you went out with some guy the other night
May- maybe you are looking actively but I I don't see it
So all I can do is sit and worry
and be concerned
and
I don't
think that you would
Can we talk about the job things no
that
Well what about the job thing
I I can't talk about them
I don't know anything about them
You want to tell me about the
Well you don't like the job I just took
Now wait a moment
Don't
Well Daddy says they're less important than the other stuff and I agree
But don't tell me I don't like the job you just took Lizzy
I don't know enough about it
You know I raised you and
I I thought I was
So maybe I can sign
ten hours in the school district doing something else
Maybe you can
eh it's it's
that would be that would be interesting if
you know you have hours during the week that are available
Don't don't don't block them out until you find out whether or not you can take a a an art course during the week
so that you can have your I mean I you know I'd like to see you flying down to
where was it that they had that hiking group
San_Francisco for the for the weekends
mhm
I want to fly out to Michigan and visit Matt
That's where I want to fly
uh I'd like to see you do that too
All I want is your happiness Liz
And I think I know what will make you happy
Well I just want to figure out what I want to do with my life
You know I feel like I'm never going to figure it out
Lizzy , you might not
I haven't figured out mine yet
You're a scientist
I'm a scientist Liz , that's a pretty poor showing for a scientist
Ma , are you kiddin
Look how many days you go into the lab
I know
Look what I've published
One paper
So who cares about publishing
Well that's what otherwise , otherwise , I I'm I'm cooking and nobody's eating it
It's it's recycling it's
it's work- working that nobody nobody ever knows about
That's not what defines me as a person
What defines me as a person is is is my family
And your failure daughter
That's what I'm feeling sad about at the moment
I just I'm not going to be able to figure out what I want to do
I just didn't know
I thought this might be interesting okay
And and maybe
That's fine
I don't that's not my big that's not my big worry about you Liz
But it it's it's mine
And I feel like I didn't know what to do and then I feel like I took it and now I feel like it's a mistake and now I
Well I'm I'm telling you I'm telling you it's hormonal
It's not rational
what to do
You don't just all of a su- the heavens don't open up as Gib
wrote and and all of a sudden you know just what you're going to do
If you define yourself that way /
you're you're you're you're you're you're looking for trouble
But I just feel like I'm /
You're opening yoursel-
putty-duddying around for the rest of my life
And I don't even have like I don't have any specific
skills or body of knowledge
I'm just sort of this
blob
Lizzy
Lizzy the mo- Lizzy Daddy feels that way too
He feels he doesn't know anything
Everybody feels that way
You just have to get used to that
You want to count your degree
You want to count the courses you've ha
You want to count the work you've done the jobs you've ha
That's nonsense
I don't know
Like maybe if I were a teacher then I would
Everybody always
you know and I taught
say
health , science and art , then I would sort of get this body of knowledge that I would have and this /
Lizzy
structure to it
And then I
yeah , yeah Lizzy , Lizzy
give it
Lizzy , that's a dream
It never happens
And I can tell you people at all levels
The only people who really think they know something
are the people who usually are deficient
When you don't know know how mu-
But there's
people who have a specific set of skills
I don't even feel like I have that sometimes , you know
it's
what they have to offer
I don't have anything to offer
yeah becau- we- we- we- because you because you can't
eh Lizzy Lizzy everybody feels that way whose worth his salt
Do you know tha
Is wha
blah blah blah
yeah
you know , it's like having a roommate
yeah
yeah
but
but you got to do what you got to do , right
mhm
yup
is there any way you could get
like do they have day jobs
you know /
it would be too hard to I wouldn't make enough money
at the restaurant
for day care and stuff
to pay , yeah it's crazy
yeah , that's true
yup
that's right
and there's really nothing else that I could do
yeah
you know and I don't think oh I don't know
yeah
I I'd like not having to work during the day
yeah
yeah
because I
so in a way it works out but it
yeah
it's just hard
and then he's taking a class another a class this semester
yeah
yeah
and that starts tomorrow
so
so , you know , there goes monday nights again
there's another day
yeah
yeah
so
and it's it's hard you know having the kids all day too with no break
yeah
I mean I don't know how
how you ever did it but
well I was never with them during the day
I just
I get crazy that's true and you had them at night
yeah
yeah
that's one thing though
just being
around more /
yeah
has been so nice for us
yeah
yup
you know
at least for me I don't know if it is for them I can't /
right
well they probably hate it
speak for them
yup
but you know I I look back and I think of all the things that I missed
when they were babies , you know , when they were just little tiny guys
yeah
right even like a bad day with me is , at least it's a bad day with me
yeah
you know I'm their mom
yeah
yep
but
mhm
so
hopefully I can
work a little less
yeah
and then
that would be
maybe that will be a little bit better
yeah
but
especially I mean you know leaving to go to work at four o'clock is just , I'm tired already
yeah
I'm like ready for a nap
yeah
uhhuh
I want to like be home making supper and
yup
and then and that's when I have to leave
and you have to get up and go and
and go wait on people
yeah
yeah
of all things
yeah
my god
watch other people have a nice supper
yeah
shit
it's awful
yup
yuck
and waitressing is
it's hard man I
it's hard work
you know and it's a thankless job if you if you've never waited tables , and there are so many people that have never waited tables
that's
it is
yeah
mhm
yup
you know they just have no clue and
yeah
like
you know I'm not your little fucking servant I'm just
yup
yeah
I'm here to do my job and I'm trying to be nice to you
yup
and
yeah , don't push it
right
and of course you can never say things like that
I know yeah
yup
but
just have to be
Suzy smiles and
yup mhm
yuck
that's why well whenever we go out I always make sure
that I leave a tip
yeah
you know unless
the service is really lousy
yeah
and then she knows it , you know , I mean she knew she what she did
mhm
right
but if they give any effort at all they get a good tip it's just
right
yeah
yup
I wouldn't want to have to be doing this right now , so thank you for doing it for me , you know
right
right
exactly
I didn't want to cook tonight so somebody there did , you know
yeah
yup
but
yeah I don't know
but we're we're hanging in there
are you
yeah
yup
it's tough though
it is
but
we had a big huge garden this year
oh did you
yeah we made tomato sauce today
oh neat
oh cool
yeah it's
bubbling away on the stove
oh bet your house smells wonderful
it smells so good
god
I just remember your house from when we were there
yeah yup
I just love that house
that kitchen
yeah
you know the kitchen was the focal point in the whole house you know it was just
yup
mhm
comfortable place to settle and you know it was just neat
yup
and it smells good and
yep
I made
a couple of times I made bread and butter pickles
oh did you oh good
yup
and
that's wonderful
I made a blueberry lime jam
ooh
and the first time I made it it came out perfect
uhhuh
but then I made it again like last week and it didn't come out right and I was so mad
oh
so did you have to just dump the whole thing out
well I I haven't thrown it away yet because it
it just /
try to
didn't get thick enough
oh okay
but it's still like good on pancakes
oh yeah
and stuff like that
yeah make it like syrup instead
so
it's like a sauce yeah
yeah
cool
but and it's it's really I don't know if you've ever canned anything ever but it's just
unhunh
nope
and when you do something wrong you don't know what you did wrong and
mhm
and why it and you don't know if it's going to come out
you know
yeah
until it comes out , or it doesn't come out
yeah
yeah till you're done with it , yeah
and then it's like
fuck man you know I wasted all this time and energy and effort , my kitchen is like a freaking /
yup
sauna
yup
shit
and it didn't come out right
I mean you know
doesn't Jeanette
do canning and stuff
oh I don't know she might
she does because she sent me some jellies /
does she
yeah
for christmas last year
yeah
so she might know
probably , yeah
yeah
but
it was fun to you know try it and then you know you just get discouraged and it's like I don't want to ever do this again
yeah
yeah
uhhuh
yup
although they do look a li-
a little Laura
What did Laura sa
Laura saw it
and an- her her comments were that the commentators seem pretty high on the Skins
yeah
everyone did
actually she
although I have to say after the game last night
um beating Saint L- or whatever Phoenix
oh
wha- or Arizona whatever they're called was certainly no great feat
I- I know eh but Miami
they are awful
eh
They're really bad
How's Penn doing
Penn is not yet it hasn't started
oh it hasn't started yet oh I didn't realize that
nope
but I will keep you
how come Laura's team started
I don't think we played this week
yeah the
No I think you're right the Ivies start later
see we don't play as many games
right
d- how did Laura's do
Well
that figures
I haven't heard from her
bu-
Well write to her she'll like that
I try it's so hard mom you don't understand how little time I have to do anything these days
Yes I do
and it's like impossible I've been waiting to find a half an hour when I could call because I can only use like it's like I have to use the whole half hour
and there hasn't been a time where I actually could just sit on the phone for a half hour
oh
oh We have to go talk for a half an hour you can't split it u
No
Not for free
oh
that's weird
Well this is something very important
We got the Washingtonian
yeah
uhhuh
and they sa-
but did you get Playbo
Playbo
yeah a girl in my class is in it
What
I told you about that
A girl in my med school class is in this month's Playboy
oh
oh I didn't realize that I thought it was a long time ago Playboy
No that was when she
she did the posing over the Summer
yeah
oh I see
but it's this month
hm
Yes it was very funny at the train station yesterday
When Elliot went to go get his
what you called
Baron's whatever
and I'm like oh do they have Playboy here let's get it
yeah
eh
and everybody is looking at me
Do you know her
Wha
Do you know he
yeah
I know her well
she's a little bit weird
She's beautiful
hm
This is strange doesn't that seem like a strange thing to do
Yes
I think so
I think it's
I mean what kind_of a reception did it ge
Mostly just like a gossipy
I mean you mean the actual picture
I mea- i-
No I I meant I no no I meant what you're saying just gossip
just as you
yeah just everybody talking about it
I think it's a s- a very peculiar way to launch your medical career
and I agree
anyway so what about Washingtonian
y-
very foolish girl no it's going to follow her that'll follow her forever
mhm
but what abo-
It really might not be bad
oh come on
It's a good picture
yeah but is that the kind are going to want go to a doctor who has been a Playboy bunn
You'd be surprised what people will go to I didn't say I would but you'd be surprised what
people will do
Well I w-
It's it's publicity
maybe going to med school was a great way to launch her career as a Playboy model
that's right
Is that what she said
no
anyway
So what about Washington-
Well what was it no well what was
alright Washingtonian is a_lot more important
They said that Maid Brigade is a national franchise
So y- you if you need a maid you can call Maid Brigade and you could get
ohgod
but I I already cleaned up my apartment
yeah but it'll get dirty again believe me
But I told I wrote you about how Elliot cleaned it up this weekend didn't
But does he always want to do i
No and he didn't clean it like Maid Brigade would he just picked the papers up off the floor
I I sort of had a feeling that might be the case
He cleaned the ki- he actually cleaned up the kitchen a little bit
di-
and made and got brunch
that was especially good
Did you get my message about Hong_Kong
that you'll try
and that I should make su-
no that
three days
How many days and all
yeah I think I get there around noon
Lau-
and that's one of the three days
that's not in uh
if you get there noon that means you won't get like to a hotel and everything until
two three in the afternoon /
that's days yeah
so you have the evening you have one evening
okay well I can do another day the problem is that like cuts down my time in Singapore
yeah tha-
oh oh well hm
like I don't I don't have that much time I had to leave on Sunday
Do you have to make the do you have to make the decision that when you go to Hong_Kong now I mean can you change the reservation with no cost later
I've got until like the twentieth I think
no no no I mean once you've done it and you're coming out here and you decide you want to leave a day early
I thought you know how those things are I could probably go standby but the thing is the flights are really packed
they are
that's the trouble well well the packed flights I sure to Hong Kong might not be packed
right
granted
that's what I mean th- th- th- you could move that par-
except there's the flights from there to Hong_Kong are the flights back to the States
and we're talking like January first
Well that's true
yeah
and so that's when everybody goes back
but
But you're not going to change that
You're right
No no not that you're missing the point
the point my point is a United flight from Singapore to Hong Kong
yeah
is one that goes Singapore Hong_Kong U S
It'll be crowded yeah
um U S yeah
So those flights will still be tight
You wouldn't believe how much trouble I had getting reservations
oh
yeah I would
I believe it yeah
I figured
actually
We're having trouble
Now all the places are full because like Amy ha- was wait listed I was wait listed to get to Japan
mhm
and then this this woman Leigh Turbush that
mhm
You know our friend here
She's trying to go to Hawaii
on this week and she's been trying for weeks but she can't get on
well that's that's uh Japan Hawaii is is very crowded
mhm
yeah
Japanese are just
oof
uh really apparently travel
yeah but I mean the time of year doesn't matter
no apparently it doesn't matter
yeah
you should have heard it was amazing I called every airline as you know only I can do
right
and I called it was with much hesitancy that I called Continental
because I hate them so much
yeah
I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route I should've known that if it took her ten minutes I should've hung up
She had me st- go from like Philadelphia to New_York to San Francisco to L A
to Hawaii to Guam
to Hong_Kong to Tokyo to Singapo- I mean she had me
everywhere
I think they're the only ones who go to
and she'd for three thousand dollars
I was like are you joking
Uy
oh I have take fr-
in a couple weeks I have to Guam and they're the only ones that go there
the Continenta
Continental yeah
That's funny
good luck can you at least go business class
I don't know if I can or not
yeah oh by the way you were right with Singapore Air it's only business class or first class goes
Right miles
to frequent flyers
Right yeah
They go Singapore Air takes you around
through Europe
they do a route that way yeah
yeah that's how they like to go
if if I you know could have gone specially through Hong_Kong
right
but that was more a little bit more expensive
and they they al- they also have connections with Delta
yeah
they only give miles on Delta but you can buy Delta seats on there
right well that's they were actually they were going to send me on T W A
I almost thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the United because
uh fewer connections but I th- instead of connecting in
eh well I mean it is a_lot further to go through Japan and all that nonsense
but the problem with Singapore Air is I have to through New York through J F K
Uy
which I now remember going from the domestic terminal to the international terminal
right
well T W A is not too bad
you have to walk a little bit but
yeah no I mean it's just not
shi- it just yeah
it's not saving me much if I have to go through New_York
but Tokyo is a bad place to layover
Tokyo is a ba- and I have like an eight hour or five hour layover there
I know yeah usually yeah
five hours
It's crazy
It's not that bad by the time you slept it's such a it's really
No but it's annoying that I have to go through Tokyo that I can't just fly from Hong_Kong home
right
that is annoying
I'm surprised you didn't go Hong Ko- the the- They do have route- where's does it go Tokyo to wher
San_Francisco
yeah was it is or Hong_Kong San_Francisco
yes
but it's full
United does have that
oh it's full I see
at that the other I mean at that price level I could pay more probably
mm
which maybe I'll look it maybe I'll find out how much more I have to pay
Can you get on a waiting lis
Can you get on a waiting list
I'll find out when I call back to confirm
Yes , it's worth waiting l- eh with Hong_Kong San_Francisco San Francisco is much better
where's Tokyo take you to Tokyo to where
San_Francisco I don't know if it's the same old same old
oh oh no yes same thing yeah yeah
Well at least put yourself on the waiting list can you do tha
yeah probably but I have a feeling it's like a price thing
Might not be
I don't know
yeah how's your sister doing
she's doing okay she's got a pretty bad cold right now but other than that , she knows she's going to have a girl
she does
yeah she's having a girl
how far along is she
ho let's see , she's due in January like the middle the I think her
due date is like the twelfth I think of January
so is she pretty much past her crucial period
well no , actually , her worst period is is the middle trimester
okay
which is you know usually it's most everyone's best one you know that's usually when you feel the best , but that's her
most crucial time that's when supposedly the cervix could fall or she could have these other problems she still , she has to go to the doctor every week
and they do ultrasounds on her every week
who's she going to
she sees doctor Ryder he's been her doctor for quite a while now he did you know took her through all of her biopsies and all the you know previous problems
yeah
and and so he's he's a specialist and he's he's pretty good she likes him real well , so
oh yeah she's doing she's doing okay besides
you guys quit screaming
she still went out of town she's out of town for almost two weeks with work and then she just got so burnt out from it it's crazy but and heather is in new York did you know that
what
heather is in new York with Brooke
yeah I heard that
you know
I bet you're not thrilled
well , I said , she's young you know she wants to go to new York and try a few things , let her do it I'd rather she you know gets
you know , I mean let her try there's doesn't have anything stopping her there's nothing holding her here
well
she is coming back , let's see , must be I don't know sometime next week or so
her a friend of hers is getting married at the end of the month
that she has a return ticket so she can fly back and still use her ticket
Trevor get down , babe
and then she's going to stay back for a couple weeks and get her stuff packed up and do whatever and then
and
does she have a job out there already
no , I don't think so but then she's going to do that and get her stuff together and then move her stuff back
come on chubby , you can come out and play toys with mom come on stinkerbox
you just want to do that
but so yeah then she's going to be back and then be back for Diane's wedding at the end of the month and then go
back to new York after that so I guess Brooke is coming back for it too so she's taking a bus or something
boy , that would be a long haul
yeah it's like I can't remember how many forty some hours I think on the bus
yeah
something like that it sounded awful
what was I going to oh tell don I didn't mean to be I just said is Kelly there , I didn't say hi nothing but you can only talk to one person I said
oh
it doesn't they won't allow it or whatever so
oh no he
in the first minute you have to get the other person on and explain it kind of a
kind of a goofy thing but I thought well , free phone call
yeah
so
oh , so what have you been doing
oh , babysitting I've
how many kids
five
oh , Karen
I know
but is in school all day
yeah Jordi started preschool and he goes in the afternoons
oh how's it
oh
it's not going very good
oh how come
oh he's having problems behaving , I guess
oh
he don't want to listen he's
so hyper I don't know we'll see he's only gone three days so and she never said nothing I asked her and then she
said something but which was I guess monday she had problems with him but
so we'll see
well you know the kids in Casey's kindergarten class are
I mean last year and it's the same kids that got in trouble every day in kindergarten class are getting in trouble every day first grade class so you know
yeah
I mean I wouldn't worry about it because I think it just happens you know
so does he have Lindsay in his class
yes , he does he was not very calm about it
he's like oh great in my well , don had seen sandy when he was because he took Casey that first day
uhhuh
and had seen sandy and Casey came home and goes yeah she's in my class and then
must have been last week lee was coming to pick up
Lindsay and I said you know I've meant to say something to you all last year and I didn't and you know said I don't know if you remember me blah blah blah blah blah and
he's like oh yeah we play volleyball together and so didn't we and I said yeah yeah so
so yeah they're in class together and Casey was already pretty upset with Lindsay once I think they've only gotten into it once
which is pretty good for them
because they moved up the round the teacher , you know , gave them new seat assignments and
Lindsay was going to be sitting next to Randy well Randy's the sweetest little kid he gets in trouble because he just talks talks talks nonstop but he's just the cutest thing
mhm
and Lindsay was complaining about it and it was Casey's kind of standing by and she was saying something about oh he's so
stupid and you know and make Casey real mad and he just told her that that wasn't very nice to say about his friend and blah blah you know so you know so the
mhm
you guys get down here come on
the neighbor lady doesn't like them by her
yard she'll come out and yell at them with her broom
oh oh brother
so oh oh did I talk to you since I was in the hospital
no
yeah I was in the hospital
why
oh I was bleeding I
oh
had blood in my stools and so I got real sick and
I guess I have colitis
and stuff so
babysitting probably isn't the best thing although they say it it isn't
stress caused it's a genetic disorder or whatever but
it doesn't help it either it causes it to flare up so
yeah will they tell you to watch your diet are you on any
no he said to do nothing I mean they basically said if
if I know something bothers me then avoid it but there's really nothing they can do as far as
preventative medicine for it and the medicines they use to treat it
are not something they want you to stay on permanently because there's a lot of bad side effects
I guess cancer mainly I don't know he didn't go into all that but
anyway so when I get sick and I guess start bleeding and that then I'll have to go in and
and they'll put me on medicine which they use steroids so until I get better and then take me back off
oh because both my mom and my sister have colitis
mhm
and they told my sister off and on that they had come up with quite a few new medicines
that could really ease her because she has you know it flares up quite a bit
then they said there were quite a few things out there that could you know ease her discomfort you know
mhm
mean it doesn't get rid of it obviously but at least it'll make her feel a little better
yeah
but but I don't know what's
I was thinking I was going to go to the health food store and see what they say as far as some things to take
there's so many different kinds of colitis he he didn't really call it colitis because he said everybody you know colitis is
a broad range of things and there's irritable bowel disease
right
and there's inflammatory
right
which inflammatory is what I have and that's a genetic disorder where irritable is just it's more stress related
type and not quite as serious because there's two different kinds of colitis I guess he said and one
is a ulcerative colitis and one is crones colitis
right
and he told me within five years I would probably have crones disease
well that's what
which is better than the other because the other turns into cancer
they they told don that he has crones well , doctors have at you know for other things and they said then he talked about his other problems and they said well
you know that sounds like you've got crones but without further testing I can't give you you know a definite diagnosis but that's what it sounds like to me well , he won't ever go that's
thank you babe he won't ever go to have another test done
well well , I had to have surgery they put that scope
you know because they're not the most yeah
I've been there , but they put you out so
I guess oh well he doesn't even want to do any of the you know like with the
either an enema or the you know where you have to drink it he won't even do that
yeah
mhm
and I made a doctor's appointment for him well before school was out it was like end of may
mhm
and don cancelled it because he thought because it was like at two o'clock or something and he he was worried that
he wasn't going to get out in time you know and we had to pick up case and he said you know we've got a week left of school or whatever it was
and I'll just wait and do it after school is out which would have been fine but never made another appointment
yeah
in one of my we have two kids who are from the south both from Virginia
uhhuh
so I'm talking about introducing like the periods of american history and I say the civil war
and they immediately raise their hand and they go we would like it to be called the war between the states
I said what they go we don't call it the civil war
they go we either call it the war of northern aggression or the war between the states
the war of northern aggression
I go you didn't just say that did you and they go yeah and they go we just wanted to see what your response was but
they call it the war between the states
the war of northern aggression
how do you like that one
so I didn't want to start a war the first day
so I I left it as is but I said we'll we'll come back to that
so I said if my history serves me correctly you guys fired the first shot
so
I don't know it's kind of funny
it seem this is one of the girls in this class was the assistant secretary Tate's daughter
mhm
very nice girl very nice girl and I have one class Deb fifteen girls one guy
this guy's name is mike it's this black kid it's a real nice kid
and I call him iron mike
I go mike we can handle them we can take them so
he's like we're not going to debate any women's issues are we
nice guy I walk out of my room and I walk I just this is a joke
I walk into miss Ryan's room and she's starting to teach and I go it it happened my worst nightmare I just like I was like this I go river
yeah
there are fifteen girls sitting in my class and one guy
Rachel sucked she goes you are paying for your sins boy
I mean she doesn't even know I do all that I mean
yeah
yeah was funny but
I I think it's funny that that all these women teach who are so you know
self righteous in thinking that you are of course being a man just you know
I could go through a horse you know
yeah I I just think it's funny I mean knowing knowing you I I
well yeah but
I must say that was wonderful outside the door after dinner I came back relaxed
it was nice haven't seen a student yet
I'm bringing my crock pot
nice I also told all the students that
my dorm my my house is off limits
that's good
I just say look I'm glad to be else but
so I just felt that was safe and easiest and
yeah
you know I didn't want to get involved I said this group we we will have group I have
did Solomon did Solomon do that when he lived there or
yeah he yeah he he didn't let anybody up here
yeah
I would have group I mean I I have group people up here like to review for the exam or something
yeah
I will not I said you know you can't get extra help you have to call me up I'll meet you or come down or something
you know they didn't really ask for an explanation but I felt that was the best way to do it
kids are I mean these days kids know
yeah yeah yeah
you know
it was already sort of known about it
so on and then we've politics and so so
I'm really not into the groove yet in terms of preparing and all that kind of stuff
yeah
in fact I mean I've got tons of stuff I was just looking through my old stuff I've just got tons
so it's it's nice in one way
no it's good that you're so organized you know
yeah it
it don't you have most of like all your AP notes typed up
yeah I do I have them all typed up
yeah
but I want to condense and cut and so so
yeah but it's a lot easier if you do that from the typed version
oh yeah
piece of cake
piece of cake
do that and then yeah
then we leave tomorrow one thirty for the game and the game's at three forty five
so be in our new uniforms and we'll see what happens challenges await girlfriend
yeah
so busy day of course tomorrow we have a half day to teach two classes

so when will you know about the the game on saturday
tomorrow or tomorrow or thursday

so
still because you thought your parents might come up this saturday
I think if there was a game then I bet you they would slide up here so I think they might be watching max
it's my impression my grandmother was saying
I I I don't know
you can talk to your grandma
yeah she's she's hilarious she's just she's
she's funny yeah she was telling me about how to hang with Katie and oh she loved my card she said she she read the whole thing to and stuff
totally noticed everything , specially like when we were
we were on this tour
We went to like the Schwartz club with my
with my group
We went there for the weekend and it frigging like rained all weekend long
We got there we were le- like let off on top of this fucking mountain like
and we had to walk like probably like five kilometers
like to to the place where we were sleeping and it was
raining and it was like thirty mile an hour wind and it was so nasty and we had to like walk through all that
mhm
and we went to this like museum up there and the guy had like
such a heavy dialect
It was so funny
He was talking to this little
kid I heard him talking and he's like hi Stacey
I'm like hi Stacey I'm like hi Sta- I'm like is wa- what what the hell's tha
Because they all say like S H instead of sh instead of C H so
that's funny well , it's easier
yeah yeah
easier for us
yeah but they're not American
yes well
How are things with yo
busy
yea
yeah I guess I sent you an email but I suppose you haven't gotten it
What since I like the place i- is like I have to
It's at the university so
yeah
That's what I figured
yeah
So but my most exciting thing is that a publisher is interested in my personal ad book
Wow
yeah , so
That's so cool
thankyou so I was all excited
And I got this letter and I was like I didn't know if it was a scam or something
yeah
Well I'm always getting letters from vanity presses and shit
yeah
You know what I mean
Where you pay them to
the- you pay them , yeah
yeah so I looked them up in Writer's Market and they did do thirty percent of their publishing vanity market so I was like okay
So I called them up the next day and it's no they want to really publish it
Wow
So but I mean the thing is I they want the completed manuscript in a month
I have
holy shit
fuck the idea of how I'm going to do it and that doesn't even
I mean that totally doesn't guarantee that they're going to publish it
That just means they're more interested and they'd like to see the whole thing
yeah
So but so I asked you on my email
I sent a message like asking people to look for funny personal ads and I want you to send it to like everybody you know
okay
okay
okay
and Craig's all busy like coming up with more pictures because I sent pictures with the
a couple sample pictures that he did
yeah yeah
so he's all busy like coming up with enough for a whole book
That's so cool
I'm so excited for you
I hope I get something , because I mean that's money and that's all I want
yeah
so but seriously like email this to everybody you know
I did and then they all did and then they all di- I hope I hope I hope
Because
That's cool
I want stuff from all over the country and I only have a few things from different places like from you and Diana and stuff
yeah
And mostly it's from here and you know my dad he got all excited so he's sending me a bunch of stuff from the Journal that he thought was funny
yeah
But , I mean I'm totally desperately in need of really fast ads so
okay
So you'll get the message though
oh that's cool
I'm so happy that I have email
I know that's so cool
Right now I'm just like well I mean it's a pain in the ass though because everything like
like I ha- I went there on Monday to
like sign up for it and I'd filled out this form and then like it wasn't ready in
mhm
until like today to do
I mean you just can't do everything like
like I had to go to I have to like wha- what the hell's that called in Englis
I have to register to
le- be here like since I'm a foreigner
mhm
so I went to go to this one place
like that's only open from like eight o'clock in the morning until
like twelve and since we're in class from nine until twelve thirty , you know I have to go like really early in the morning
That's so funny
I know isn't
Well
goofy and so I I had to go to like this one place
and like fill out this total form and then it takes them two days and then I have to go back , well I was supposed to go back
today but I didn't get up early because I was tired , but I have to go back tomorrow
in the morning to the second place to get my visa to live here like
they can't do anything in like one fucking day you know
Sounds like Russia
like I know I know
is Russian way
yeah I know I'm like okay we're a first world country
ohgod that sucks
yeah that's what's I mean it's so funny because people talk about like I mean I guess the university and all the professors and everything I mean there's like
two two over two million almost three million books in the
in the library and stuff like that and of course like the professors are really good and the classes are really good but like
there's so like ass backwards like as far as the computers
huh
an- and like how many there are an- and you know
ah it just really it's really funny
uhhuh ha ha
hm
All you hear were we have lots of computers and everything is done in the American way
I know
I know
I was typing today and my
the Y and the Z are like
changed around and then there are some like other special characters and then
like the apostrophe you have to push shift to get it
and there's like a number sign in the normal place so like
half the things I sent out today probably had like
like number signs instead of apostrophes
mhm
Weird
yeah
hm hm well oh look at that cute little boy walking down the street
oh your hair is so obviously dyed , my child
And it rains every frigging day
It's been re- unlike
so glad that I don't have pneumonia
Especially from that weekend like up on the fucking mountain in the rain
hm
It's like it rai- it's rained every day and of course like you can't just stay inside
Like , you have to go
hm
yeah
How's schoo
hm okay
What's the matte
oh I'm just really busy and I wouldn't be near oh first of all I have Shana's shower coming up that I have to do
ah that's right
That's going to be like a huge like three day effort with all the cooking and cleaning and like actually party that I have to do
Is there anyone you can get to help yo
um Jessica's going to help and Beth might because you see , Diane is here now
oh okay
And Diana is bored because Beth is working every day and she has class at night
uhhuh
But she wants to go out with me but I am like so fucking busy right now
yeah
I have to read sixty pages of Russian today
It took me like five hours to do like five pages so I just sort of quit
mhm
And I mean and she's like she wanted me to spend the whole day with her today
and I felt really bad but I was like I'm sorry but I simply cannot do that
It's just not an option , you know
yeah
yeah
And she's like well maybe we can meet in the afternoon
I was like yeah I'll see how long it takes me to get this stuff done
So she calls me at nine thirty in the morning to see if I want to go out
oh
And I'm like I'll start studying now
So she called back at noon
I've onl- only read three pages of the sixty I have to read
uhhuh
and I'm like well maybe we could do something later tonight
so now e- I like keep pushing back the time you know like well maybe you can come over at eight well maybe we can do something on Friday and it's like
I'm not going to have the time at all until she leaves , you know
Well
it feels like a real pain in the ass
That sucks
I know I I just have so much work to do and it just
It 's just not an option to not do this work because
It's just me and this other kid in the class
yeah it's not like he's not going to call on you
with a scary professor
yeah so it's not like I can just sit there and pretend to have read all of this stuff
yeah
So and he I don't know he just gives a ton of reading
Probably not remembering that he's expecting us to do an extensive research paper , as well
Reall
and I've already go- I'm already up to my eyeballs in work and Joanna Nichols is
insisting that I take this independent
study with her but she doesn't want to teach it
I don't want to take it
We don't know what we're doing
She doesn't want to meet me
It's like
Hell
And I still
I know so she's like well come up with a bibliography of dialectology
stuff you want to read an- and see me on Tuesday and I'm like you obviously don't want to do this
I don't want to do it
so oh she was on N P R last week , by the way
Reall
that's cool she taught
After she was on Talk Nation
What was she talking abou
She was talking about the origins of language but the thing is I didn't hear it because Eric heard it in the car and he called me at work and left a message but Darren was on the line
uh
So then Eric got there and we turned it on
I only heard the last few minutes
I heard her laugh , though
Wow
What'd she d
Sit on a whoopie cushio
I don't know but I mean like millions of people heard her laugh
It was pretty wild
so anyway I'm very I'm just so stressed out right now that I feel like crying and it's like
the last thing I need is somebody going to me let's go out let's go out let's go out
It's like I can't , okay
But I feel bad because she's only going to be here for another week
I feel bad that you're so stressed again
I thought like this semester would be like better for you
I'm only stressed
this weekend because I have all like I have
party and I have Diana and I had to finish up that book review for Language Magazine
yeah
I didn't even read the book
Wow
Well , I hope nobody listening to this is from Language Magazine
but I
indeed do a book notice and just all these things that after this weekend , like half of them will go away
yeah
You kno
yeah
So I don't know I jus- I just I hope I go to Holland
Wouldn't that be coo
That would be so cool because like even this weekend I was just thinking because we're all like deciding we're like oh where do we want to go this weekend because there's like
a cool offer with
with the trains and stuff
you can for
Thirty marks total
five like up to five people
can go anywhere so it's only like
you know like five marks each within the German border for the weekend like leave
How much is tha
um probably like twenty bucks
uhhuh
So you can go for like twenty bucks I mean but
but like really like four bucks each like
Anywhere within Germany you /
uhhuh
go for the weekend so we're going and
then like of you want to go outside the border then you can like pay up to the border and then you pay an additional little fee
Right
And
so we're going to like Switzerland this weekend but when we were all just like
deciding where we wanted to go the weekend I'm like wow I wish Linda and Eric we here
I could just
pop up to Holland and see them
ah
yeah
Well
I'm trying to get things done but Carl you know I talked to Carl
He's really busy
yeah
and like the board of directors is very unhappy because it
our American business is not doing very well so it's probably like a really bad time for you to be irritating Carl about this
yeah
being the C E O and all
yeah
but I called him up and he was like well
I can let you kn- you know or we I'm definitely
outgoing like we could definitely go
But did I tell you thi
He said they might be moving
oh no
So that means that they wouldn't have company housing
Where would they be movin
because they're above a furniture store right now like doing manufacturing so
ah
okay
He said but you know we'd find a place for you because he knows it it's
totally impossible to find a place in Utrecht
yeah
It's like we'll find a place for you and we can ta- all I wanted to know
All I need to know is how much are you going to pay me and what are you going to give me in this packag
yeah yeah
They're very dusty honey
I couldn't believe how many sweaters you have like
ohmygod
y- you could open a secondhand shop for like thirty sweaters it's
ohmygod
yeah we have a_lot_of very crappy sweaters
I mean a_lot_of it looked like
yeah
yeah
I was thinking to my- well I wouldn't keep this
I know I know
thankyou so much I can't believe that you're doing all that
But
So and then she washed like all the dishes that were on the shelves like so when you come back at least you know you have some
ohmygod
Clean dishes and something you can wear and
oh I feel so bad you know it's like I fee- I I
I I don't feel so bad about you because I don't feel like you're so traumatized
but I feel so bad about Tamara because I feel like she was sort of truly traumatized you know
by the whole thing and I don't
yeah but it's o- it's okay I mean
I mean
yeah yeah she's really sweet
I mean after she went in and and ha- eh saw the fleas she never went back in there she always sent me in
she sent you in
have you been have you been watering the plants by the way like along the way
because I know that she never went in
anymore
I I watered them like once
before I bombed the f- the first time
yeah okay good great
and n- now again but they they they look okay
yeah okay
okay great I kind o- because I was thinking like um at the point where that happened
I was wondering if like Tamara
like got so shocked by the whole thing that she just like didn't
you know think to tell you that she hasn't she hadn't been watering the plants because I knew that she wasn't going in there you know
yeah
and stuff so yeah
No , but now it's
really they're definitely gone now
oh boy
I mean Tamara is still like you know but you know there still can be a a mutation
You're a big spoil
you know there are mutations you know and
who was saying that oh
Tamara
Poor poor girl
she's totally
yeah well as soon as Lilly
but Tamara come on I mean
yeah but as soon as Lilly is back in the apartment they'll go on her and if we keep
um you tol- did you tell me about the stuff that you rub into them and they the fleas die
yeah but you don't you don't need that you don't have to put that you don't have to give that to Lilly anymore if the fleas are gone
yeah the fleas are gone
I don't think it's so good for her you know
yeah i-
because it really goes into the the blood you know
yeah yeah
But if you let her out again I mean I have
yeah then it can happen again
but you know you can put a flea
collar
collar around her you know
right right I'm going to do that
I'm sure you know
I actually have one here still I I felt
We've never we've never had a flea in that apartment which is you know it must have started with one
little fucking flea you know
uh it's really bizarre the whole story how it got in there
you know the thing it's like the thing like I was horrified when Kristen told me and I was even getting mad and I was like saying like didn't you ever clean the place
you know and apparently it doesn't have anything to do with that
No
like if the place is clean or not you know
No
and my sister Lisa said that her house has been infested um several times with fleas while they were living in it just because of the dog you know
and the dog was always running around outside and and you know the place gets completely
um infested and she had to bomb while they were living there and what they did was they
bombed everything but the kitchen you know
mhm
and then like they put down a plastic thing over the dining room table and things like that but you b- and you know it's like and you just lived in the in the poison afterwards and she said well yeah you know
that's that's
yeah well I mean all you can do is like just wash everything make a do a Spring clean when you get that
yeah yeah
yeah
Well when I get back you know I mean if Tamara washed the plates that's very nice but I'm going to take them all out and then I'm going to wash down that
you know that thing and I'm supposed to be speaking native English
Well she did that
she did that
the kitchen shelf the white one though she didn't she didn't get everything out of the cupboard and
and I mean you still have to do that
yeah the white
no she I don't think you have to I don't think you have to do that really I mean we don't use those
You know we noticed afterwards that the door was a little bit open you know one of the doors so
yeah so that's that's okay but I think the only thing that's in there are glasses we'll wa- we wash the glasses
yeah yeah
but that's so sweet of her I can't believe she did that ohgod I feel so I feel horrible
No it's okay
yeah thankyou so much
thankyou so much
you're welcome
You know it's it's
You owe us a nice dinner
Yes , I know definitely
a real feast
A total feast , yeah
oh Christian's really looking forward to coming back
He's he's getting like
mhm
getting a little bit tired of being here because like it's so hard
to break into the scene like there's so many musicians here that even if you go to like a session and you play really good and people see that you're
playing good and turn their heads and stuff like that , nobody comes up to him and asks him who he is /
yeah
because they they don't want to know anybody new you know it's it's like they don't want any more competition and he's like
yeah
You know , he was going to a_lot_of sessions for a while
in Harlem and stuff like that and then he kind of just got fed up and stopped and he's been practicing at home
mm
but he's about ready to come back , you know And I could stay here longer , definitely
Yes , yes I love being here I love being here
yeah
You know I do really good just being here it's a- you know I think I do want to spend a longer period of time in New York again
mhm
You know it jus- it's it's it's you know it's just totally natural , probably because I have my own place , but
you know , a_lot_of good things are are happening
Like the show is coming up
I'm in the middle of framing these photographs for the show and
show's coming up and I've got my book into a couple of different collections and things like that
mhm
and just you know seeing people that I haven't
seen in a long time and you know getting to know a couple of people a little bit better , like I got to know
Karen remember k- Laura's friend , Karen Rosenfla
yeah yeah
yeah I got to know her like a- I mean we went to school together and everything like that but I didn't really know her very well
I got to know her a bit better
I got to know my sister inlaw
Arty's wife better and you know it's been kind of it's been kind of nice just being back , you kno
mhm
and stuff but god when I come back to Berlin , it's going to be it's going to it's going to be like
You know stressed from day one because
yeah
because the show the show is coming up in the Vica and um
Want to hear something funny I wa- wanted to show those objects you know those overpainted objects in the glass cases and stuff and I'm going to make pedestals
Wha
for them and stretch this kind of brocade fabric around
uhhuh
around these panels you know of the pedestals and they're pairing me together with another like conceptual minimalist
um Gunda Fursta who did like a red projection like just a like a slide projection of a red color onto a wall as like a last
you know work that she did
I think it th- this one gallery and what she wants to do is is um
have like wall to wall red carpet put into that room of the of the
of the space you know which would go together with the objects and the pedestals really really well
mhm
So if she if she does that I mean unless it's an ugly red
You know , but
it's probably just going to be a very deep kind of red you know
I think it's going to kind of look funny
where is that going to b
in the
where is that agai
they moved
They used to be on Furssdom and they moved to Brunemstrascher
Budem , righ
Brunemstra-
Brunemstrascher , yeah
uhhuh
yeah
so
it's going to be
this Hai Tawanly show that I saw in New_York when I was there is here now
Where at the
yeah
really
the only the only stop in Europe
oh wow is it going to still be open when I get back
uh yeah until November some time
oh good
oh good good good because because I like his work I'd like to see that
it's a big show
yeah
it's great
I so- I sold a book to the Museum of Modern Art
Did I tell you tha
No
oh
and I sent I sent one to the Whitney
Well
but I haven't heard anything
From them I mean it's just a measly little book
if you know what I mean but
because I got like a total thrill out of that
what do you mean you sold a book to them
uh this the little drain book you know
yeah
I sold them one they bought one
the archives
oh the archives oh
yeah
yeah
because I've been trying to trying to get it around into other
um archives
but I haven't had
you know any good response
Now your name is listed in
in the Museum of Modern Art
I I I don't even think so no
yeah right it'll be engraved in stone on the outside
well not that but
somewhere in the computer
um poss- yeah it's somewhere in the in the in the archives
archives computer
computer right right
yeah but it's not I don't I don't even know if that's considered officially part of the collection you know
Lilly stop that just
what what she doin
She's fucking got my chair completely
ohmygod
she's scratching all the time up
I'll have to get her a scratching post
and then she does these things she loves like being under the red material under the chairs
yeah
and then like sometime- sometimes she drives me crazy I mean I like playing with her like that but
yeah
I total- I sit here and I and I don't even know that she's under the material
ohgod
and then I'll let my let my arm hanging down and then she jumps like
you know jumps at my arm and
starts and she thinks I want to play with her and then
sometimes I'm just really like shocked
she's very very playful
yeah
she's very playful
oh
that's going to be nice to see Lilly again there's we have two cats here and one them is kind of dumb
The thing about it is the city is so beautiful but I it is so trashy too there's parts of it where I mean
they just don't nobody takes care of it I mean there's litter on the ground and there's I mean there's parts of the city that are just you know graffiti on the wall and
hm
you know that it's really it's really kind of sad because it's such a historical city and and there's parts of it that is not taken care of at all
but anyway so we did a service project and went and picked up went and picked picked up trash you know and we were all out there on the street
um that goes leads down to the old city
and you know all these Arabs started coming out and helping us and their kids started coming out and helping us and some of them would just come out and just stare you know just be like
like all and just kind of like just kind of in amazement wondering what we're doing
and I don't know I just kind of felt you know there's there's a_lot there's more than one way to do missionary work here
oh yeah
you know so it's it's really good the people have very good impression of us down here
they're whenever we go into the stores they're like you're a Mormon you are welcome here you know you you it's special discount for you because you're a Mormon
you're we like you
yeah I'll bet they give you a special discount though we like your good American money
Some of them though like there's this coup-
Wha
They like your good American money
yeah they do
Some of them invite us over f- for dinner at their house and
Did you g
um I haven't gone yet but there's this one guy that he sells um what's his name his name's Murphy
he has a shop he sells sandals and and stuff like that and so he he always invites
like ah invites about twelve students over at a time you know and he'd and
ha- invites them over for dinner at his house
there's a couple other people that are really good friends tha- um that always deal with the chi- the kids from the center that are pretty well known
and so like Omar he he just sells olivewood carvings that are absolutely beautiful
and there's a couple other people that
that's it's not as ki- it's kind of fun to interact with them and
and anyway it's it's fun really fun
huh
It's different being down here though it's there's you know a lot differences the food is really good though the bread is wonderful
like everywhere you go there's pita bread and the other kind of bread that you like dipped in herbs and spices and stuff and
it is really good the bread down here is good and there's lots of fruit there's like pomegranate trees everywhere I didn't realize that pomegranates were grown down here
huh
We even have one outside of our outside of our room on our balcony
Do they have fresh prom- pomegranates on it right no
It does you can eat em they're good
oh wow really fun
There's olive trees all over like okay let me describe my room
it's you go outside the coolest thing is is that like
the whole center is built on a hill and so instead of I mean it's eight floors but it doesn't like
it's not like high rise eight floors it just kind of cascades down the mountain you know what I'm sayin
yeah you sent me that picture so
oh yeah so you kind of see it saw it
which one did I send you
is it just of the cente
yeah just like an aerial aerial view
oh yeah okay so you know what I'm talking about
yeah
Anyway and so then
like our room is on the floor fourth floor
mhm
and you actually go outside to get to our room there's a hallway that's outside
and then the room's are just I mean they look like little apartments you know that you get into
and there's the hallway is just all done in marble
and you know there's trees in the hallway and
and there's ivy that grows on the wall and you come into the room
uhhuh
and
and you know it's got our beds and the bathroom and stuff and then
and then there's a patio where you go outside and there's a wooden trellis that kind of bows overhead and kind of makes a little roof for it for us I guess and it's got all of these flowering plants on it and ivy and
and then we have this big rose garden in front of us and and then you just have this perfect view of the city
So you're actually above the city what
yeah right we're above the city we're on mount Scopeth which is right next to the mount Olif
and so
um Jerusalem is right below us
it takes about fifteen minutes to walk /
Is
into the old city
Is the Jerusalem center on the highest mountain for around ther
um it's yeah well pretty close
like Hebrew University is just above us
What's it calle
Hebrew University
is just right above us
we go there a_lot we have access to all of their stuff
um their library and
everything like that but
And who who's that done b
who a University
um I think it is just a state university
you know
From Jerusalem hu
yeah
ah well no I mean the state of Israel
yeah
ca-
I think that's who runs it but
um
there's a_lot_of people worldwide that are there
huh
I'm sorry I'm like trying to wake up
Well I thought I guess I was an hour off I thought it'd be just about seven o'clock and you'd be wide awake by now but
You are now
I am now
we we have tomorrow off too
oh do you
what's nice is we have like
four days of classes
and
and then we have
um
three days off
it's weird though because it's Sunday over there now hu
yeah it is
Sunday night
see we have our Sunday on Saturday our Sabbath on Saturday
and so it it's so easy to get confused with days I'm just I forget what day it is because it just it just messes me up
because Sundays you know we go out and go on field trips and everything like that and anyways it's confusing
But oh I'm taking my Isaiah class so wonderful it's so good
At what ti-
I love it
What time do you normally start classes
um at about seven forty
At seven forty
yeah we have we have our Old Testament class in the morning every morning at seven forty
And then I usually have usually have I'm that class is a lot actually we study a_lot down here
Surprisingly enough but I have my Old Testament class and then I go to do either
um N E S Near Eastern Civilizations it's really good Brother Skinner teaches it and he
What is it N N E S
uhhuh Near Eastern Near Eastern
Studies
What does that stand for I said Near Eastern Civilizations that's not right
No that's a C so
what is it
Studies Near Eastern Studies
Near Eastern Studies that's what it is
okay you'll have to give me a break because I'm a little tired
Anyway that's a really cool class because they you get to learn all the history behind everything
And it starts making things in the Bible make sense you know
oh yeah
you know you find out oh okay I understand you know okay when this happened when Abraham was journeying and
What was going on politically in the area what was going on culturally in the area and all of a sudden the stories kind of make sense
And it just they just come to life you know it's really neat I like it a_lot and then I have
then I have my Jewish Culture class taught by rabbi Rosen
he's really really good really good teacher and ah tha- that's been interesting to to learn about yeah
Does he speak English pretty well
yeah actually he's British and he speaks with this really cool British accent I love listening to him talk he uses all of these
um cool words and in his British accident accent it just it just kind of sounds kind of neat
he's an he's a neat figure he's really energetic and anyway um he ah
and then there's this Arab Civilization class that I take from um from Brother he's an Arab here
a very prominent Arab Muslim down here he really was influential in getting the center built here
he worked with President Hunter a_lot that knew him very well he is so neat and I wrote I wrote this in my letter so you'll get it twice but
um he was talking to us one time in one of our classes and he was saying somebody asked him he's known as a dry Mormon
down here and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant and and he said
he just started he kind of laughed and he started going on about how he first came in contact with the church and President Hunter and
and he said and he just started getting all he got all choked up you know and started to cry
and ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself but he said he said that
he said that he always felt like in Islam they believe that Mohammed was a prophet
hm
And they believe in all the other prophets that the Old Testament and the New Testament you know that Jesus was a prophet
anyway but they believe that Mohammed was the last prophet you know and so he was the seal of the prophet
they don't worship em him or anything they just believe that he was a prophet and and
anyway he said it always didn't seem right to me that God would not send any more prophets down to the earth that Mohammed would be the last one
that he wouldn't give his people guidance you know that that would be it you know because he's seen a_lot in his religion
answers that they don't have and problems that you know people kind of go astray in these different ways because they don't know
you know and it's funny because I learn about the Jewish religion and it's the same thing you see all of these divisions happening and all of these questions and you ask
you know there's the old joke if you ask ah three Jewish men a question you'll get four opinions
You know tha- I mean they're just
they're very you know you you really do I've talked to several of them you really get different things
because you know there's the ultra orthodox and the reformed and the anyway
and so he was just saying that ah he never thought that that was right and he said when I
whenever I am with your prophet President Hunter I he says I cannot explain it it's just a feeling inside
and then he'd say do you know what I mean
and we were all just silent you know and
and just nodding our heads and he says
yup
he says I just cannot help but feel that that this is a man of God
the car is running fine yeah
good oh good
okay phew
it's always always an adventure with you
what
sorry
no that's okay like I said in my letter
it's a roller coaster
so how are you doing
I'm good it's cold today today is like the first day
it's cold today here too
but it's been really chilly they were calling for it all week so I was prepared for it you know I knew it was coming it didn't get me down
and I went out and did my walk this morning which felt great and I've had a sweatshirt on
good
and then I came back here and
I
finished working out while I watched cartoons which I haven't done in a long time and
right
and then I just cleaned I cleaned and cleaned
like I did this last sunday too lots of cleaning
right
first I swept the floors then I scrubbed the bathroom floor with
the tile cleaner in water and then I scrubbed
the whole floor out here with the Murphy's oil
right
in water
so hopefully that'll cut down on the dust and I just cleaned so much my knees hurt
if you lean down on them they really do
and it took
well we have to give you something else to do while you're down there
yeah
and it took couple hours
you didn't get it
but
I got that done then I showered and
had lunch and just checked my mail got this thing in the mail
oh yeah
put the trash out yeah
they're still not done in my bathroom yet but the guy came in and checked it today
they're going to finish it up one of these days soon they've got other work they're doing
tonight I'm seeing Sharon
tonight what
tonight I'm seeing Sharon
yeah you wrote you told me about that in your letter
yeah I'm so excited because I haven't seen her in so long and Todd was going to go with us
but then he
decided not to because he has to go somewhere with the spring cord band
right
which Sharon and I both find annoying because we want to see him
and she's home right now
I know you told me everything in your letter
oh I'm sorry well I'm probably going to go home
with hers so I go to my house tonight and go to church in the morning and everything and then she'll bring me back here tomorrow
oh right
yep
and honey I've been
agitated like I wrote to you
mhm
what's going on
I don't know I think it's because I miss you so much
it's going to be all right don't worry about it
I know it's just it's getting to me like
no I know it's getting to me too nothing has been happening
I haven't been doing anything but working
mhm
and going to classes and being in the studio
I know I'm not worried about
that and like I'm not worried about things with us but it's just that
I want to see you I want to see I want to see you
going to be fine we'll see each other soon
I know I know
when is this party
it's October seventh
so that saturday
yeah
okay
which let me just check it to be sure it's in it's two weeks from today I believe
okay
yeah it's the seventh
so I have to leave a note
two weeks
for my manager
and
yeah
it it's going to be okay don't worry
I know I know I
why have guys been coming on to you or something or you're like getting all frustrated
no it's not that
no honey it's not that it's just
I want to see you
very much
if you want to see other guys you can just you want to talk about that or something
no sweetheart honey listen to me when I talk
I am listening to you but I are you sure that's all it is I mean
I want to see you yes that's all it is
it and that's I think what's getting to me like
like last weekend I went to comedy sports with my roommates and
I know you told
two other couples and oh honey wish you were here
you know
I know
and it's not that I want to talk to anybody else it's not
it's that I want to be with you
but I'm feeling better today and
it's going to be okay don't worry
yeah I know it will now I know
it'll be fine don't worry
it's just I find
just keep just keep doing your work keep focusing on I notice that I I don't think about
right
the fact that you're not here because I am always so busy you know and
I'm hoping that I I thought a lot about
some ideas for what I want to do
uhhuh
you when you read me email you'll you'll see I wrote you a long letter
okay
I'm hoping that excuse me I'm sorry
it's okay
I'm hoping that tonight
or now when I go to asleep that I can
dream about what I've been thinking about
yeah
uhhuh
and I want to get up and I was going I have a paper due soon so I want to get busy on that and
mhm
I mean I just try to just focus on on
yeah
it gets hard sometimes but
you know I haven't had any anyone approach me or whatever
I nothing I mean
mhm
there's been one incident
but it wasn't even an incident it was one girl
who I think is a metals major
kind of stared at me once and then I saw her again and she was staring at me again and kind of smiling at me
mhm mhm
so I approached her
I approached her one day outside on campus when I saw her again
uhhuh
with her friend
and and this is the reason why because I was walking by and I saw her with her friend
well I'm taking a class
in
physical anthropology
I applied here's the whole story
this is first let me give you the whole rundown of why I didn't call you earlier /
in case your
family didn't tell me
I I didn't have your phone number
oh so that's silly
yeah
how did you get it
well I called your family
oh
and then
they have it
and then they had it
yeah
and then
mhm
Ben's
father and sister came for a few days
mhm
and
so I couldn't really stay up late and call and I couldn't
get up early and call
mhm mhm
and there wasn't
you have to entertain and
you know Rachel is like being on the couch downstairs and
so
and then and then I couldn't find your number
and then this whole thing with the classes happened and let me and then I couldn't get up in the morning because I knew that you were on
doing classes and stuff and like you would get up and go to work in the morning so I couldn't call you
at night I would have to get up early and call you and I just couldn't get up
and then that whole thing in the class like I applied for the graduate level
uhhuh
right and I went and I talked to them and I said you know like what
what are you looking for and they said basically what we're looking for is that you don't embarrass us
you know
you don't embarrass us
right so I was like
what the hell who were you talking to who were you talking to
okay
to the it's like the college of general studies
uhhuh
it's like sort of the night school and they have this program where you can take four
graduate courses
uhhuh
and pay like the reduced price in my case I don't pay anything because
mhm
of the benefits
and and then if you enroll in the program it's there
so you know and it's like
it can it serves for graduate school as like a stepping stone to get into the program
uhhuh
like you know that you don't have it's not
as rigorous an application process and all that /
mhm
stuff
mhm mhm
right so
you don't embarrass us and then they were like what's your grade point average and I told them they were like well that sounds
about like what we're looking for dadadada
you don't embarrass us
I know
kiss my butt
so then /
I get this letter we're sorry you have not been accepted to the graduate level
oh no why
you have been accepted for the undergraduate and I'm like I was devastated
oh no
I was devastated
I'm sorry honey
yeah well it then I went in I was like I went in to work and I'm like
at work
and one of my coworkers was like look
if what what probably happened is they didn't like the classes that you had
and they wanted you to have particular classes that they deemed appropriate
bingo it's all like
great
cultural anthropology that I've had
uhhuh
no physical anthropology no archaeology
uhhuh
and I went and I went in and I talked to them and they were like you you know they said that that's what it was I was like
meanwhile I had like
spent the night crying
going I'm not good enough they don't like me
it was horrible I was like fuck that
oh
ugh
I felt terrible
yeah you should
never believe that you are such a good student
I mean even at Earlham you were a good student
you got
I know
good stuff going for you you know
well it's just like this like after being out of it for a year
and
it's not something you lose
oh I feel like I have
I mean your brain
feel like I'm getting
I feel like I'm getting stupid
may have to like take it out and polish it once in a while to keep it up to date
yeah yeah
but
yeah
still there
so but I I mean like it I mean it really hurt
oh honey I'm sorry
it really hurt
but I'm fine now because I know that they're just it's just because they're snobs
well that's what you get living in Philadelphia girl
it doesn't have to do with Philadelphia it has to do with the university of Pennsylvania being an ivy league school
exactly
exactly that's what you get for living in Philadelphia
being around ivy league schools man
there are a couple of different places I could live where that would you know I could be at /
temple which is not an ivy league school
that's true
but /
so
you live in Philadelphia so you're going to go to university of Penn
mhm so
but that's that's my major story
that's the story so now you're in this physical anthropology class
yeah which is I was kind of like okay it's going to be really scientific and
the kind that if it's irregular all the time
mm
um evidently it causes it the possibility of causing a clot is very high
hm
and so
um they I don't quite understand if they're going to do this or not
but sometimes they administer a small shock to try and get it sort of back on track
mhm
um so it gets back to a normal beat
but otherwise you just try with drugs or something
Well no what they do is they
give him drugs for an anti-coagulant
so that whatever clot was in there and caused that hopefully gets dissolved
mhm
but then they you know they have to monitor that very closely because for example
a week and a half ago they said okay you can't shave until we see you again
well
in other words you'll bleed to death if you
oh yeah right
it
See it's a very dangerous what's actually what's more dangerous is that some sort of internal bleeding begins and
you don't know about until you're dead so
mhm
yeah hm
but they they cut him down to one checkup a week instead of two which is
mhm
uh very promising
yes
and you know how it goes those little things I'm sure you recall
are very meaningful
yeah yeah absolutely I was at I was at a meeting yesterday and
that was the the something to do with the hospital and so we went had fru- we had lunch at the hospital
mhm
that's really weird going in to the hospital
oh
that must've been very weird
yes but
have you been to that hospita
since
uh no no
um but I've been I you know I've been looking at it for a while already so it was okay
uhhuh
and I was looking
eh the I was there for two days for a meeting and the day before I had already
looked up because I know the the walkway between the two parts of the building
where I would walk you know things like that
uhhuh
So so that was okay
and we had coffee down in the normal coffee place
uhhuh
and so and the people there who had visited me were there and so we joked about things and it was fun
uhhuh
so was it
what was the meeting there fo
eh it was about projects
oh at the hospital
yes
yeah there's a there's a group of people who do work
in computer stuff in languages eh
awful at the hospital
oh oh I see
so anyway you've been horribly busy
you're a victim
yes horribly horribly horribly
I'm sorry
oh
but now it's now it's over with now it's okay
good
good
so now I can uh well
eh start to feel normal again
uhhuh how long do you get to feel normal again
eh I I'm not sure but anyway for the time being I'm normal so it's okay
uhhuh uhhuh
you'd say it's going through eh getting back to normal it seems like going through your email
uhhuh
and you know electronic mail
and cleaning out the last two hundred messages that you had ignored
ohmygod
because you didn't have time to eh eh look at them
ohmygod that sounds like a nightmare
yes
I come home to three messages on my answering machine and I
yes
practically shut the thing off or
exactly so this is
wish lightning would strike and just break it or something
mhm
or anything
so anyway so you had a nice time with Jesse
yeah I had a wonderful
I heard about that yeah
yeah I had a wonderful time with Jesse that was really great except
she probably told you don't go to Santa Barbara on during fiesta
not the time to go to Santa Barbara
uhhuh
There are twenty million people there I mean not no kidding
oh
but it was really fun anyway
but we got sort of burned out going downtown
because we
Yes it's
the the fourth of July there's not that many people
not compared
you're not you're not overwhelmed by people li-
yeah nothing like fiesta I mean it was nothing and that's probably
you know we don't have much to compare well you have more because you've been there more but
that's probably more than it's usually there and fiesta was just
mhm
that means I think
half of Los Angeles went to Santa Barbara for fiesta
but it was fun anyway well it was I didn't care where I was with Jesse if I just
yeah
sit in the car in traffic jam and talk to her I don't really care but
but but what is fiesta anyway
um
Well it's
I don't know it's a general term I mean they have that in New Mexico too it's
just it's a Hispanic celebration I don't what it
If if it even ack- you know acknowledges some particular date or anything I
I think it's just a yearly you know festival it's like
yes
mhm
like carnival or something you know just a time
everybody gets dressed up and
they're li- you know hundreds of incredibly cute little kids all wearing their
yeah
you know purple and silver outfits and
You really did yeah right
makeup and they look so proud of themselves and they were really really cute
but it's just you know lots of parades lots and lots of parades I mean
parades seem to be the the main thing to do and then
you know stands where you can get all kinds of you know tacos and this kind of thing and
Ban- sorry bands singing and stuff like that so
I don't really know what it is beyond that
but it was really fun anyways
but but Snow you didn't know that was any eh special historical eh
not that I know of no I mean in New Mexico it's the s- same they just have something called fiesta and it just everybody
has a big party and
well
I don't I don't know if they have anything connected to it or not but anyway that was lots of fun
yeah so how's and and then oh yeah but then they've been there since in the meantime too at your place
yeah that's right
so was that before that was after
yeah that was when when the when the Josh's father had to
right they
that's right that's right they were here
just eh keep track of the
sometimes because I wanted to congratulate you on the cowboy boots I heard that that would
oh yeah boy are they cute they're that was so sweet of them you know the
Jesse had seen those six more than six months before that and remembered which was amazing to me and I kept refusing to try them on because I thought
mhm
you know why should I try them on they're two hundred dollars I'm not going to buy them but anyway she remembered so that was really really sweet
and anyway I have them that was it was a fun visit unfortunately
that all happened with Josh's dad right when we were going to go somewhere but
um we had a fun time anyway
and some friends of mine were looking around Portal you know where Jesse did Jesse tell you where they went and stayed
Well I don't remember that she said the name or anything just that it was somewhere
y-
yeah it's this place that's very special to them that they
um told us about and we went and visited it before we even came here
mhm
mhm
and it's just this little
beautiful canyon that looks like paradise the minute you walk into it and
they have little cabins for rent there and when Josh and I first visited before we even moved here
we both just went oh let's just
buy one of those cabins and forget about it
right just hang around the cabin yeah
forget about having a cafe
We could have a cafe where
one person a day comes and has a cup of coffee and
yes
anyway it's really really pretty and
evidently Michael had
actually Jesse went with him years and years ago
when he was at U C L A there's a research station up in this canyon and and
oh yeah because she had said to me that they didn't stay there they wanted to to have something a bit more
you know different yeah
right anyway so that's how that spot
came into the picture and they finally went there and stayed there and had a wonderful time
mm
and some friends of mine who live here were looking at
property for sale all over the place and that was one the places they were looking in that particular area
So I got them to give me their real estate map of where it was and sent it to Jesse and Michael I hope
hoping to and I put a little arrow that said you are here hoping to egg them on so
mhm
Well at high time th- they buy something similar so
yeah well I you know I figure I mean it's none of my business and you know it's hard to say what
what people you know I asked I asked Jesse point blank you know can you
Are you in the position to buy something right now with you know the land here relatively speaking is really cheap I mean like five hundred dollars an acre you know
mhm
yeah
yeah
and she said yeah so I thought shit you know whatever happens
maybe they should just buy some land and you know if whatever they can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit because they don't like bed and breakfasts and
yeah
you know it's sometimes it's good when you have the money to get the things you want because
yeah well they've been talking about getting getting places for a long time and they just never get around to getting any place
later on you know
yeah I know well I think I mean I'm just imagining you know what their position is because it's I'm sure it's it's very hard when you're doing something and you
yeah
can't get out of it you know to do any anything
No they won't but they but they can at least have some vacation time or something
right or you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you buy some land y- it's yours
mhm
you know I mean and the taxes on it are nothing I mean even if
yeah
and you can always sell it in in the worst cast you know
yeah but now is the time because
real estate is really going up around here now
um southeastern Arizona has gotten a_lot_of attention and
uhhuh
I think there's lots of urban refugee type stuff happening where people are
unhappy more and more with the city and they don't know what to do or how to leave or how to make a living but a_lot_of people just come here and go fuck it I'll figure something out you know
So it's kind_of a strange thing to be happening
um
Yes
you know very sort of anti what we were all brought up to to do
mhm
y- you know
kind of backwards of the American dream where you get your career and your little house and everything and
anyway so I've been trying to tempt them So I told them that we would go and look at this property if they wanted
but anyway
yeah but the- they also fixed the the Christmas vacation they're still
a couple of weeks I guess and then he's going to try to you know find a job and stuff like this
okay
so but he's he's al- he's been hooked up with
yeah
different programs but
uh
um I'm trying to think what else is going on what else is news
Chris and Michelle mom and dad
What's Nathan doin
Did you hear about tha
No
uh let's see how do I put this he was
um
uh he actually was was was caught stealing
oh really
yeah and there's could be certain charges pressed but
um
Se- that's g- going to be worked out I mean that that happened like four fi- four weeks ago
uh
So it's pretty much just settled but he was
at the lumber yard
yeah
they had they had
a a a detective who
ah
yeah
who was and he was caught selling you know to a person lumber
So yeah that's I I I I had forgotten all about that
Well you mentioned that I I was under the impression that you'd already know ab-
yeah I know that's okay
did he always worked this way
yeah
Don't worry I'm not worried
yeah it's it was it was one of those
yeah in fact I was the last one to find out
Well at next to last
wait
yeah right right
I ha- it was just
one of those things yeah but
So that that has to go via the court so
yeah well like each kid has to go through theirs I guess huh
yeah
there's always something new
yeah
So yeah that was interesting but
mm mm
So yeah
that's really
I mean that yeah I guess would be the kind of like the the the major news then
yeah
uh see well I mean se- last time I talked to you I didn't think I started
school yeah no I'm well I'm back into school Sara is in school
um
Sara is working with children righ
um Sarah what are you doing right now are you working at the
You're not doing you're not working at the hospital are you
You're at the V A hospital she's working at the V A ho- the veteran's hospital
uhhuh
She's doing their she does like like group counseling and stuff like that and
uhhuh
I'm here with two sisters from Celon
Right
And that's the island next to India
yup
and I think it's pretty neat that that you married
a a girl that's u- that's from India u-
oh they think it's neat
yeah
yeah
yeah well Sara should be gone but she mi- hopefully she's going to go back
there this summer so
oh good the Summer this Summer I should be coming home
yeah well wh- would you know what do have you have any tentative uh
No I have no i- it will probably I have no idea probably July August
oh yeah yeah she'll be back by she go in the in the Spring
uhhuh
So yeah ooh yeah that's fun that'll be well see I this is for both of us it's our last year of residence
yeah
And then once we- you know we still have to do we'll have to write our dissertation but
We won't have to be going to school and stuff like this but
oh that's that'll be nice that's thirty years of school huh
So
oh yeah really
so that aspect will be done and then so yeah
mhm
So I'm trying to think what else is going o-
Are you f- are you following the pope's visit in the United State
yeah
yeah
yeah that was a he was a i- it turned out very good
That's good I heard some lady died while he was saying mass or something
oh I'm sure s- there's a_lot_of people I'm sure th- statistically there's a good chance of someone dying
yeah
yeah it actually was the the the coverage was pretty g- or the
the sense was good because
oh
a_lot oh yeah and he has to yield his presence
uhhuh
You know how he has his presence and people are attracted to his presence and
yeah yeah
feel that that whole phenomena's still
yeah
um
Because the Italians made it sound that they he wasn't bein- getting much attention
And the reporters weren't ready and they weren't they weren't ge- he wasn't giv- getting
c- good coverage in the United States
Well I know before h- well that maybe
tr- true
I mean to some extent I I haven't like it's like I have a
yeah
I don't watch T V so I don't know what's on T V but
the
the news-
uhhuh
Well in the see before they had
various theologians who are critics of them
yeah
who were you know saying that you know he's just
he's not in touch and all this stuff
yeah
there there was that aspect but once he was here the amazing thing you know because
it it doesn't make any difference what the press says because
uhhuh
because once yeah he has those huge crowds
yeah yeah
And that and you know there's still like
Mi- mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds
yeah yeah
And his ability to have like instant conversions I mean I
I've known tons of people and they're just there to have instant conversion
yeah that's good
So I mean it doe- I mean granted he the process doesn't necessarily help
Right
but there's something about him where he's
he doesn't need the press
yeah yeah I mean it
yeah
I mean because he's able to get the
you know so that
yeah I mean in in j- oh I guess it's
you just become so it's so much part of What you expect
there will be this qu- like they'll bring up all these statisti- like like
st- st- statistics how people
while even while they like the pope they disagree with what he says
uhhuh
d- I mean they'll they always do so you kind of
oh yeah that's normal
just become accustomed to it
Right
But I know but just he it's amazing how
you know i- it's i-
you know people who
have that an incredible affect I mean I don't know
I don't know what it is but
So yeah that yeah that I I've be- I ha- I've been following pretty closely you know through the papers and stuff but
yeah so he's leaving about right now he'll be leaving pretty soon
yeah because he's only staying five days
yeah he leaves today tonight
uh
So
yeah so did how was Julius stay back at in in at
I hav- I really haven't even seen her since she got back I I only one of the sisters came down to Sicily so they sent me the letter
yeah
uh I was just wondering how her family was doing
yeah I have no idea
so I have to go to Italy to find out
right
yeah because I I don't I haven't like in fact Mark is trying to get hold of John
yeah yeah because I yeah I had written
because he wants to see about me Mark was thinking about going to some type of vocational school but
And John is in the school in in Saginaw or Lancing areas and
yeah
yeah
Saginaw I think but I don't know
yeah
So
I'm trying to think of what else is what else is happening in the big world here
Yes it's just basic ever- we'r- we're back to the grinding stone of papers and stuff like that so
yeah
yeah
I with one of the people I teach with
uh he's t- he's doing like he's principally responsible for all the English translations for John Paul's work
uh I see that's nice
yeah
but and
so I it was it's funny to hear they're there but um
I'm trying to think what else is I I just spur of the moment called I had no i- I was like well there's something what time is it right now in Ital
okay it's it's twenty to nine
okay
We already changed our time did you guy
I don't I don't I hope I didn't
w- we sent it back
I h- I know that's coming up pretty soon I don't
uh yeah we do it before you guys do
okay so it's nine thirty
No it's twenty to nine eight thirty it's eight thirty
oh good oh you're only like five hours behind right now or ahead if I four or five behind yeah
yeah yeah right right
So gosh so what what's you know I want to ask y- g- how is is this with is that
Is there anythin
Is that just more or less what it i
it's pretty much a- anything that's going to happen or not going to happen is pretty much done righ
ah I think so yeah
yeah
How's the mail order
I think they're doing pretty good because I don't have too much contact with them
Right right
And so I ha- I really have no idea to tell you the truth
yeah
um see yeah because I I know that this Summer they did a vocational camp but I have no idea how it went
Right
Because I'm being down in Sicily it's you know we're down
yeah oh yeah I know you're
I don't know mm mm
yeah I'm surprised you guys have a house there wow
yeah we have two houses in Sicily
oh really
yeah we're twenty minutes apart
right right
and so
and eh next year we should be going to Fatima
oh wow that'll be a big break for you guys then
yeah
yeah
fir- the first of October
some of the sisters made like how many of them there was this
eight sisters that made their final vows
okay
And on the twenty ninth of October fourteen sisters make their first vows
How man
fourteen
good
and they're the ones that went Diana was with them
Well that would've been the group of Di okay
She knows them yeah
okay
and then we'll have three that enter nov- novitiate
okay good
I don't know how many well do the fast li-
eh come and do the eh I don't know
yeah
well I was telling s- I I seldom you g- I don't know how you guys do things but
I if you guys ever get a ch- like if there's any of the sisters in in Rome like
s- the the midwest they should go to Stevenville
uhhuh yeah
I think that would be great because I you know like the I don't know if you the Dominican sisters in Nashville
uhhuh
I was very inf- influential helping them get sisters in the Tuperville and also the
The Daughters of Saint Paul
yeah The Daughters of Saint Paul are good sisters
yeah
In Amer- in America
I ha- I have a very I have a very close ah
you know relat- I've helped him out in so many different ways I
yeah
getting their pro- their religious ed programs started but
uh
parishes and then
help them with their vocations and
uh one of our sisters has a sister in that order
right
yeah
their I mean they're I mean they're they kind of been around they have been at the trench I mean
yeah
because they always of course the ones that I know the ones that I really know are from Cleveland and
uhhuh
they they said
that you know of course they they they still have some troubles like with the with the Italian sisters but
uhhuh yeah yeah
I don't know what they meant I mean I don't know what exactly they meant by that but
but I mean in general I mean they have like a moderate increase in vocation
uhhuh
something like that but
yeah that's I I'll but if you if you ever ge- if you ever get a chance
w- we have a sister that lives in in Illinois
What do you mean she lives ther
I mean her family is from Illinois
Good thankyou
to tell them that you had arrived safely
Good okay
and then she's got here that Sister Justa died in Berlin today
oh sorry to hear that
about
ten thirty P M their time in Europe
aw aw
in Berlin
aw
and she was conscious to the end
aw
How nice
but her death was difficult because of difficulty in breathing
uhhuh aw
So
aw well tell Sister Acklin I'm sorry but she still plans to keep her p- her plans to go righ
she said yes
yeah mhm
okay they're on the
then he asked said to ask about the weather over there
well it's very rainy here today
The weather here reminds me of Florida
oh
It's it's very muggy
very muggy right now I don't know if I need any Winter clothes
but I have them with me because it's very muggy
but the house here
breathes it has a_lot_of the way it's built it lets the air in so that's very nice
oh that's good
yeah yeah
and she said to ask about the food what kind of food do you have
oh the food is fine they're they're
they I have coffee and I have
nice fruits
mhm
and they even had a baked potato for me yesterday
isn't that nic
Imagine
a a real bake-
a real baked potato a-
oh that was good
and you know they have nice bread oh the sisters are very very kind
oh that's good
and
today was my first day that I went over to the mass I didn't go to the mass yesterday because I slept but today I went to the
to the mass over in the um
in the compound where the priests are
oh
so I had my first experience of walking over there
Is it Englis
No Chinese
it was it was in Chinese
yes but uh
the the priest who picked me up at the airport Father Dominique
he he is a newly ordained priest
and he speaks some English and he wants me to teach him more
and he said he will come and say the mass once in a while in English and so that will be nice so
oh well that's nice the Father Dominique he said he speaks English
Father Dominique speaks some English he is newly ordained and he
oh some
oh what about that other priest that remember there was supposed to be another priest over there
Well the I haven't met the Father Simon
oh
oh
he is in Rome right now he's supposed to he was he also studied in the United States but he's in Rome right now
oh I see
I want to tell you that when I got to Chicago
My sister Agnes was right there to meet me so that was very nice
oh that's nice
and then she waited until I got on the plane and then after I got on the plane
um
there was a mixup because
the people in Chica- I didn't realize this until I got to San Francisco
that the people in Chicago they took the wrong ticket from me
oh
they took the ticket that says from San_Francisco to Taipei and so when they
oh and then what happene
when they got to San_Francisco
the lady said I could really be charged for a second ticket and I said oh no
oh
but she didn't she didn't charge me she she called Chicago and she recognized the mistake they made
well that caused great confusion for me because when I got on the plane in Chicago
I had the wrong seat number somebody else had that seat number that's because I was dealing with a different ticket
oh my goodness
so anyhow it all worked out but it was
well I'm glad
a little confusion but while I was on after I got on the plane in Chicago
and they were they were still boarding it was very very crowded it was a seven forty seven
All of a sudden they called my name
to come to the to the front of the plane so I finally got through all the crowd and got there
oh
and they told me to got out to the desk and here my nephew Tommy
C K the one that has cancer
mhm yes
he came to see me and he he didn't get there on time and so my sister Agnes
she went up to the man and asked if if they could call me off the plane
oh my good-
so I got off the you know I got on on time to see him so that was very nice yeah
yeah
yeah
well that was nice
and Sister Margaret Mary and Father Dominique and a teacher they met me at the
airport in Taipei
oh that was
and it was
it was their October the tenth is their Independence Day
so there were a_lot_of fireworks and it was very
oh
oh that's like when the first sisters came
Just like the fourth of July that's right
It was extremely crowded in the at the airport
oh
oh
and then we had to drive for three hours
oh my
to Elan
and it's true that it was a curvy drive
oh but Father Dominique drove it
and then we stopped at a
eh one of the parishioner's house he he makes tea so we went into the store and that was an experience in itself to see how they they make the tea and then
oh I bet
yes
we just sat down and he boiled the tea right in front of us put down the put the kettle on right in the little store and boiled the tea
mhm
and gave us a little cup of tea and some cra- cookies so that was nice and then we got to
we drove the rest of the way then to Elan

There's so many things
I can't think
But
How is
How's the kid
oh they're all fine
It's so cute ,
the other night we or no let's see Sunday night we got to have uh Nancy's children
They stayed overnight with Grandma and Grandpa
oh right
And then in in the morning we had ah raspberry leaf tea
/
and muffins
That was the starters
With those girls you know
They're such pigs
I e- oh anyway
So Nancy made them pancakes and scrambled eggs and /
sausage patties
oh and they ate it all
And and they ha- oh they had a wonderful time
So then at supper when they were home that evening they were telling their daddy what all they did at grandma's house
And he said next time I'm staying at grandma's house
You can stay home
And so of course they love that you know
So it was cute
oh and you know what Kendall , Nancy was /
cutting down the
irises
And you know they have those stiff pods /
mhm
in the fall you know
So anyway Kendall must've bent down and
poked her eye
So anyway d- Nancy took her to the do- doctor and they think it scratched her cornea
Let me tell you
oh no
um there are birds here
Yes
Lacy is laughing at me
There are birds here that attack you
oh re-
You're kiddi-
No literally
They will attack you and and poke your eye out /
oh
and eat your eye
oh
because I
They've been like attacking people
And remember I told you I got attacked by that bird in the
Yes
Well that wasn't yeah , it wasn't the same kind of bird he was just trying to steal my food But there are bir-
In the park
He wanted your sandwich
Right
But there are birds here that
like if you walk underneath their nest or something /
Yes
they'll /
Attack you
swoop your head and claw your head and get attached and poke your eye out
e- I just saw in the paper today , a little boy a little boy got attacked and /
oh
e- he couldn't he couldn't get him off his head , because you don't see them coming
Right
So it
um
it like
ate his eye or poked it out or something and /
oh
oh look at my plant whoops
and there was yeah so he's blind
oh my goodness
Isn't that sic
And they're like and w- I run in the morning and they're all around where I run
oh
Magpies
oh Magpies
I've heard of that
Isn't that gros
yeah but we don't have them We don't have them
I
No , no , but I mean I've heard of a a Magpie fly
Right
I- but I've heard of that
Or a bird
Isn't that sic
oh my goodness
oh a- you better be careful Amy
I know I
I didn't know it
I never heard of that
yeah
oh my goodness
oh there was something else I thought of to tell you
mygod
And now I can't think of it
come on
e-
ah
oh Daddy has been going up to church and and th- him and John have been spreading g- grass seeds
So they're they're
reall
Dad's yeah , he's been doing that
Did they blacktop that ye
Yes and it looks very nice
Did you decide what kind of house y- you're going to ge
Well you know what we're kind of e- not
did you say we were
going for the log cabin because you know they have maintenance
on the outside a_lot
And so I don't think we'll go with a log cabin house
hm
mhm
I think we'll
Get a regular
Or or a thick-built they call it
You know
but I can't do that
oh well
Well what about the hous
Is that lady going to buy i
Well the lady is still interested
But
But not ready yet
But they have to sell their home first
oh
And so but they like the big old farm house
0
So that was exciting
What about Larry and Tim did th-
are they still
Well the thing is we have to
uh see how it goes first w- if we're able to sell it
You know
And if not then then we'll d- think of the other
That's good
That's good
Right
That's what we figure
But what was the hassle with hi
oh nothing
with Larry
nothing
oh nothing
uh-uh
oh
I thought they gave you a hassle
No
oh no
No
uh-uh
And and Larry has been coming deer hunting
oh really
He has a
He he has a blind back in the fields you know
oh jeez
And so e- he comes in but I I really don't think he'll get one because he said shooting the bow and arrow
from the tree is kind of hard to do
You know to kill a deer
So
There was a guy doing it back there when I was out there
uhhuh
once
Right
That's right
You had walked back in the woods
yeah
Was he up in a tre
uhhuh
oh well I
He was up in the tree
uhhuh
So that's what
In a blind
That's what they have to do
hm
Anyway
So it's oh Amy it is so beautiful here
I'll bet
ohmygosh
It is oh do you know what we did Wednesda
Went to Wisconsin with Ann Hanson
Or did I tell you that alread
mm mm
No
Yes
No
uh y- her sister lives up in Beaver Dam
oh
And Dotty , Marianne and I had wanted to go to this quilt store up there
oh right
Yes
I remember
Ye- her Nancy's sis- um
she's on television she has a quilting show
yeah , I've seen it
So anyway so we went up there and then Ann was able to visit with her sister
And then we went to the quilt store
So we had a really nice time
And
hm
And of course Ann enjoyed Dotty
And Dotty
oh really
yeah , yes she really enjoyed her
So
Anyway
mm
They so we did that Wednesday
oh that's good
yeah and Aunt Mary Lou
yeah how's she doin
She's sh- u- I don't think she'll get any better
You know
um but she's doing
is she getting wors
um very very slowly
mm
But you know the doctor said she'd be should be thankful she's walking
mhm
Really
uh he said it's just a miracle she's walking because
um most of the patients that get that are in a wheelchair
So
hm
So that's really she should be thankful for that
yeah
So
what else to tell you Amy isn't this exciting we get to talk for a half hou
I know
I can't believe it
It's a_lot_of money
W-
What time do you go to work tomorro
eight thirty
At eight thirty
mhm
uhhuh
And then do you work eight hour
No
Well usually yeah
oh
I either work it's a weird schedule
for the next two weeks
uhhuh
It's like I do four hours then four hours then
next day I'll do nine and a half
then eight then nine and a half
it's like over a twelve hour period
uhhuh
It's it's kind of confusing
And then a four hour shift on Saturday
I see e- how's the weather ther
so
It's still cold to me I don't know it's getting warmer I guess but
It is getting warmer
yeah
what are you doing tomorrow
It's going to be warm tomorrow I don't know what twenty nine is but
uhhuh
Guess it's warm
oh
Have you gone down by the ocea
yeah we I well I told you we had breakfast on the beach that day
Yes
That was beautiful
oh I bet
Just think you're by the Indian Ocean
I know
If it's it I
There's whales there's whales down here
There are
Do you are you able to see the
Hi mom bye mom
Wha
a- are you able to see the
No
I well we could we could just go like out watching
But we haven't had time
uhhuh
No , I'm you must be busy working
yeah
oh but e- Amy it's been eighty degrees here
oh
ohmygosh
It is so pretty
I bet it's nice
It it is
yeah , but it's supposed to get cold tomorrow
Or tonight it's supposed to there's a cold front coming down from Canada
oh reall
Reall
So it's going to be getting colder
So
And you know it that's kind of good
We've really had a hot summer
yeah
I know
oh I
been hot
It was the hottest
oh do you know what I'm been making sweatshirts and you
I I affuse
doily on there a heart doily
Are you going to send me on
And then I put the yoyo's around e- they are so pretty
You uh , they re- so I was making one for Corky
Her birthday was yesterday
mhm
So I'm making one for her
oh
Right
It's you know she likes rose color
So I found a sweatshirt on sale for five dollars
oh cute
I f- I found a but you wouldn't want a sweatshirt now , would yo
It's cold air
oh you don't have to make it now
oh no but I bet in the evening it's
It's cold yep
uhhuh
Like
It's cold during the day
I wore a t- I wore a turtleneck and sweater today
oh really
Pair of jeans
yep
oh
it's cold
uhhuh
oh my
Have you have you /
e- looked into nursing at the hospitals or anything ye
No , huh
I can't mom
oh you can't yet
How many times do I have to explain it to you
I can't do it without my license
I'd I mean I guess it just totally makes sense that they do because that's just not something I think of Iranians doing is making films
Gassing Kurds and shooting Iraqis yeah that makes sense that they do that
Well , that's a different kind of Iranians , I imagine
Which I think Nassir's more Persian but it's the same area then it became Iran later
Meanwhile , back at the ranch
I thought about that the other day
ha I use that all the time , still
It's kind_of amusing
Things never change
Yes , they do
Regardless
So any- what's happening with you and Sharo
Well , we are here in Italy
mhm
In
which is this little , basically nowhere town about half an hour from post
and it's gorgeous
I look out the window
I look at the Alps
Everywhere you look it's just like little red tiled roofs just like you see in the postcards and the picture books
uhhuh
i- it's awesome
It's amazing
um so we live here in this third floor apartment going to work every day and then coming home
On the weekends , we try and get out and go places see the country
Getting a little more difficult as of late
We're kind of busy over here as I'm sure you it's all in the news but
uh right
Though well anyway we're we're busy
Let me put it that way
okay
uh yeah it's fun good
That's nice It sure is weird hearing your voice
yeah it's been a while
I'll tell you that
yeah about a year and a half
yeah something like that
Something like that
You does your email I mean are you getting the email
I think you are I mean you responded okay
yeah mhm
Usually whenever I get a message I respond in some way or other
sorry you know me but yeah you know my mom finally got email
oh reall
yeah
What's her email addres
oh I don't remember off hand
That's okay
You can send it to me later
you want my mom's email addres
yeah I'll write your mom
okay
I write everybody
that's funny
yeah well
She one of her students showed her well it's funny enough that she finally got email after I've been telling her for years to do it
right
and now she's has this big push that everybody needs to get it
right
hello , mom
thanks mom Thanks for the thanks for the tip
and one of her students showed her how to get into the X five hundred directories
which are
which h
what are the X five hundred directorie
oh where you put your how c- how can you not kno
address sometimes a- and then she ca- can put you like favorite fa- favorite beverage some other little information , mm where did you travel
oh it's like a your finger file kind of thin
mm no it's different but sort of like that
okay
um and for my favorite beverage I put down of course almond tea with honey and milk
mhm
and so she read that because that was what was there and when she sent me a message
She wrote that and wrote big mama's watching
And ever since , everything she signs from me is love big mama
what's she doing nowaday
Just out of curiosity
um she's teaching computer science at Wright State
okay
Computer Science
yeah I mean wa- she was doing math and computer science but right now she's just doing computer science
Mostly applications
um not any real computer stuff the hard stuff , the programming but
yeah
This is how you do M S Word , this is how you do an Excel or a spreadsheet whatever
Important
yup
So what's it like living in a coop
good
Actually , I'm the president
Are you reall
What i- now don't coops have like a particular theme or is it the
No , this is just a living coop
okay
I live well
a_lot_of the coops at Michigan a_lot_of the coops in general are houses
This is more of an apartment style coop
mhm
That's sort of a cross between a dorm and like a house
okay
I mean the room it's very dorm like in terms of the room , like you have a room , but on the other hand
right
it's well it's mostly graduate students so
That feels different but no in that way I mean it's really nice to come home and have dinner ready
right
Like a nice dinner every night , cooked specially
There's a chef who takes care of things during the week
oh that's all right
There's and he plans meals and every people here put in three hour work shifts and prepare it but decides what it's going to be
You know and she'll come to clean the bathroom every week you know /
Right
deal with the mundane things that I don't handle well /
yeah
you know on a regular basis when I start feeling overloaded
although I haven't it it's it's so much easier than undergrad for me
I'm sorry It couldn't have been much more difficult
I'm pretty much just taking it easy
that's cool
Studying a bit here
Going out and doing stuff
Watching Iranian films
I'm not watching them Nassir is I'm
oh you're not going to watch Iranian film
No
I'm going to see my friend , Molly and some other Earlham friends
ah
I
Well I'm sort of disappointed
I wanted you to tell me what Iranian film was like but you can ask Nassir
Actually this week he told me it's a movie about this woman who I think was a nurse
and actually did a_lot_of work and did a_lot_of good stuff but then when she got married
her mother inlaw is very traditional and so she stopped working because it was making her husband unhappy
right
and then there was some kind of disaster that had happened when a plague or something I think
and so she brought her skills back out into the open and cures people and does really good things and
so it it gets into some of the problems of traditional sie- society and roles of women sort of pro feminist kind of stuff
Sounded neat to me
It's one I would watch
yeah cool
Last film I watched was Star Wars
Bought it on video tape
Twelve ninety five
Pretty cool
yeah
Well wh-
Not exactly deep culture , though
It is , well , it's very cultural
I- It is very pop cul- yeah very pop culture
Pop culture
Well you know why they re-released them for the last time , righ
yeah because they're coming out with the new ones
Well not only that
They're redoing parts of the old ones
I guess I'd heard something about they're going to do like computer graphics or something like that
I don't know
They're redoing parts of it I think to help fit in with the with the new one
And so that way they get two major sales of the three video tapes
Seems like a pretty good deal to me
I'll buy them
I'll help
I'll support that part of the economy
Support your culture
Your taxpayers' dollars at work
Star Wars yeah all three of them twice
yeah I watched you know five days of them
I don't need to go out of the house
Why leav
I don't know
Get a case of beer an-
Rebecca
Sharon says hi
I say hi
hungry
say again
Do you want foo
No I just ate remember yeah I ate at the Burger King
0
Some things don't change
No I'll tell you isn't that sa
I'm here in Italy and I ate Burger King for lunch
I can't say I'm much better
I had Lucky Charms for breakfast
That's awesome
I'd never had them before
Say again
ye- I mean before the last like few weeks and I tried them an- and they're interesting
Interesting I think is the only word that I would use to describe Lucky Charms
I mean I don't I don't know
I I've never really tried fruit cereals and it's a whole new adventure
you should try Captain Crunch
ooh I I actually did try that
It's icky
yeah it is icky
It's pure sugar and ick sugar and ick
I can't eat that stuff I'm getting old , Rebecca
oh
I'm an old man
No , you're younger than I am
I creak when I get out of bed in the morning
ooh my knees crack
That's the thing that bothers me
yeah
anyway
What are tho- okay the big question
okay
are you going to be back in this country any tim
whew no time soon
Just though you might come home for Christmas or something
Nope , not a chance
mm
We have we have what's called a I R F which is the Initial Reaction Force
Turns out that the battalion I'm in is the only American
airborne in fact the only light forces i
e
we don't have big
tanks and shit
in Europe
And so if anything really really bad happens they will deploy us first because we're easy to move
yeah , I'd deploy you
You're easy
and
I've always said that
I know it
but
So we rotate responsibility in the battalion on who's on a basically a four hour alert
Need to be there with all your gear in four hours
and during Christmas , I'll be on it
So I ain't going nowhere
ah
oh well
You know one of these day-
Should come to Italy
Yes I should , in fact
When I have money again
I've been spending more than I ever have before lately
Probably have more than you've ever had before lately
Well yeah
yeah
there you go
So I'm the nothing girl now that's good too
mm shut the fuck up and don't start this shit on me
I'm starting to annoy you oh I met this I was in the middle of telling you
This class I was having
We were talking about like education and how it was used to be very like economically based like it was all just
like create workers for
the society it was like a factory model thing and
And all these things are coming out and
and even like the Wharton type people you know people who that I would think would like be more Eric's wavelength that aren't all
Happy happy happy peace to the world etcetera
And even they were like
backing me up on this point and I'm like I wish Eric could be here because this is the one argument I could like use their support and he might even accept these people's support
What was what was what was the argument abou
I don't remember it exactly but we were talking about
About of the fact like
the history of the educational systems and the factory based model like where educations are where education was just like
turning out future workers they were keeping their students basically had to survive in a corporate world but like factory world or
mhm
It was it was you know things I don't understand like the economy but
How you know I would've disagree
I y- I don't know that you would've disagreed but I could hear you
Because it started that I was I
Whenever I take notes in class
like I take notes on what we're talking about but like my first day of class I wrote a note to Jen I'm like
Jen I'm excited to be here
And in this class I wrote a note to Mike my friend from New Orleans and I'm like Mike
um
I wish you were here right now you'd love this professor too buh buh buh buh
oh I'd love to hear your opinions I know they'd be mine and help support me and then I was like
0
I wonder what Eric would think about this then I don't know
And I think that was the day actually that I got your postcard it was like later like
mm
that day later it was a little weird
mhm
yeah
uhhuh last Friday
um
yeah one one day I wrote like you Mike Jen Gee Schmerls Andy
Frank and Todd
Wow
I wrote I wrote like all my friends from home one day
I wrote it are Russ and Beth back ye
No Beth might Russ is going to come home soon I think Ru-
But Beth might stay a little while longer and then she's not sure if she's going to
do something else with this company she's kind of not sure what she's up to
Do they have an address there but I hung out I hung out with
yea
yeah he came
One night
I heard can't like couldn't find any place to live that he could afford and stuff like that
yeah I don't know how hard he looked but yeah pretty much
Is he is he better now is he like happy at leas
Well he's not in Spain anymore he's like he went to like
Turkey and then he's gon- he was taking a train
from London to Turkey
It was like a two and a half day train
Long train
And then he's like went to and then he went somewhere around th- went around there and to Athens maybe
and Turkey and then he was going to like Mo- back to Spain and to like Morocco and like I don't know
aw I want to Morocco and like Egypt and all of Northern Africa
I think in January I'm going to go to Turkey and and Egypt
Reall
For two weeks
I was thinking I have a really long
um
spring break
mhm
I think it's long once my exams are over anyway I have like a
Once national exams and then I /
0
I would like I have like eight or nine days and I have this
U S Air airfare thing where the second person can fly either free or half price
mhm
so I thought if Beth is in France I would Jen and I would go visit her we'll meet you somewhere maybe or
Something like that I mean very very tentative just playing with the idea thing but
That'll be cool
mhm
But I I need to get away I was supposed to be in New Orleans until tomorrow
That's probably about the same t- your spring break is probably about when I'll be in
France anyway
Was i
mhm
oh yeah fine okay
Beth was coming coming over to England in January I don't know if she still is with her mom
eh she doesn't know what she's doing
hm
See her mother might be going to England and she or something and then she was going to go too
yeah something like that
yeah I only ta- I've only talked to her once
hm
She was she was even in this weekend and I didn't see her
They all went out on Thursday night and no one ever called me
oh really
mm
So I haven't seen her
But
So is Mike is Mike is Mike finally starting to work hard at law school
I think he's working hard like
In the beginning he said he was only going to go out on weekends I don't know if that's
true now or not
mhm
But Jen and he seem to be go out a_lot
together
But
yeah
Reall
yep
How about Schmerling have you heard anything from him
Like Schmerling goes out with them too
One night actually
probably the last time I went out like two and a half weeks ago three weeks ago it was
Mike Jen Schmerling me the guy Mike's going to live with Dave Abrams you know him righ
yeah he went to Emory
oh that's right I don't know him I knew of like I feel like I should know him so anyway Dave Abrams Melanie Laflin
And Jen Stein we all went to Milkbar
Jen Stei
yeah
That what the hell did that girl do with her lif
Did she graduat
yeah she
She's waiting to get her certification I don't know if she's passed the exams yet
But she's substitute teaching
oh okay
And yeah
she prett
Is she prett
did she ever get good looking or n
I think she looks the same I don't know it's a very
I always thought she was in a awkward stage she'd grow out of it maybe not
I think I think
I don't know , what did you guys find unattractive about he
In general
She had goo goo eyes I think I don't know
yeah I think those are always going to be like that
She had horrible hair too
yeah that's , she can't help that though
Like people
I don't know she just wasn't pretty I don't know
yeah right well she basically has the same eyes and the same hair so
yeah I guess she's still ugly according to you I don't know
I thought Russ used to do the impression of her giving head it was so funny go all cross eyed and shit
okay
Must have been funny in high school
I don't know if he is anymore or not I haven't seen him
When he's when his w- when his mind's with us he is
yeah
So what else was I saying so yeah so I seen like
Wait I was telling you about going out
And that was it was like because of something I was telling you that
hm
But I don't know
uh oh that was Schmerling so I saw Schmerling he was doing good
He's been going out with like Mike and Jen a_lot too and I because I think he knows Dave Abrams from somewhere
Hebrew school
Is that what it was
mhm
Did he find a jo
um not since I've spoken to him which has been like a week or two
Is he looking any prospects or no
um I think he's had interviews
I'm happy
yeah I think so
That's a big step
yeah I mean he's definitely like getting more into the looking for a job mode kind of thing but
oh he's been in it for awhile he's not ge- he's been really into it
I was going to say like he's not one that I would ever doubt he would do that
mhm
Like he'll be successful he might just you know he'll work his way
He just doesn't have the op- he doesn't have the first step he's never had a good internship he's always had to work hard every summer
Right
He needs a first he needs to settle for his first job and tell I don't know
If if you talk to him
message to him
yeah
well I don't want to preach to him
But I definitely learned over here that
eh before you get into marketing you have to first do sales
yeah
Not necessarily I have friends in New_York doing advertising marketing and
they didn't do sales first but they had internships so
They had some kind of internship where they did sales or something like that
Had a advertising internship where I guess they kind of had their own accounts
Whatever but
But before marketing do sales okay
Even even even if they're doing some advertising thing they're not
They're not
Probably the first thing they're doing is selling the advertisements that's probably what you do your first year
yeah the internship that I got offered was like basically it was um
Consulting but for an advertising firm like yeah go out there and
Like it was like yeah
Trying to sell the adver- sales
yeah
Exactly before you can before you get into marketing yo- you almost always have to do sales
So like we'll give you an account in a month or so but you know this is what you have to do and they'll you'll design in a little while but
without
yeah you you have to you have to earn your yeah you g- I think
I have to give Craig the number of that little firm that he might like that especially since they deal a_lot with golf products
mhm
And
And I know like it was piddly piddly money and stuff but
um I mean he could probably work and do a part time internship I
I'm not sure if he's in the position where he can actually
Where he can work and do an internship part time
Well I don't I don't know maybe he is but I I don't know I think he needs more he he needs some money
Like he w- he's working a_lot_of hours at the golf course
yeah that's what I'm saying that this is the kind of thing where he can fit in
mhm maybe maybe
I don't know
He'd probably have to work almost every night though I bet
I don't know
I have no money right now but I finally just got a loan I'm so excited
mhm
That's cool
My physical came the next day I'm like oh
I haven't gotten a paycheck yet I'm getting one Tuesday I'm dying for it
Reall
Have you like
Have you made a_lot_of money because of commission and stuff
I've only been working like two weeks I'm broke though I need money so bad
yeah I just like
I never lived this poor in my life
This is the first time I've really like
felt what it's like to like not have
Jen I have a four pound a day budget
I spend two pounds on dinner and two pounds on lunch and that's it
That's all I spend all day
I've given up Eric I've lived off of
Like
Like I don't think you understand I've had spaghetti every night for three weeks straight
Eric I haven't eaten because I don't want to buy my own food and if my parents aren't bringing something in to me I don't buy food
Like I don't I would not be able to live on my own right now at all
Like I
I haven't gone out only time I go out is when my dad gives me money to go out
And it's horrible yeah I've been sitting in a_lot reading
mm
I have this list of things that I you know I like buy
You at home stil
uhhuh
mhm that's what I thought
I have no one to live with
You talk to And
yeah well actually I left a message on his machine he was visiting Kim this weekend
oh yeah that's cool
And I found a place downtown that's perfect for him
It's a cigar bar it's like no drinking but they
No he knows about it
oh he doe
I'm pretty sure I I
oh I went by it's right across from sugar mom
There's a_lot_of them actually downstairs there's one oh that's probably a real gay trendy one
No it's not it's like there were like biker men there
It or no
There's one that's been there's one that's been in like Philly since like eighteen fifty it's supposedly like it's real yuppie but it's supposed to be really cool
oh that wouldn't be this one but this one looks old but I w- can't imagine
It could be that one I don't know
But it doesn't look yuppie in there at all
It's like it's not yuppie but it's kind of like trendy I don't know because like cigars are
People in here weren't trendy like we went in
Like to go to a cigar do you do you realize how much you're going to spend on a cigar if you go to a cigar bar and smoke a g- a good cigar it's like six bucks a cigar
Well it's like getting a drink at one of you know a bar that was like you know you get beer or you get a drink for six dollars you can have a cigarette for twenty five cents or a
But's it's not like
No it's not it's it's like it's more like
Because you can get a beer but you can get a cigar for like fifty cents
But it's like what it's more like it's like not just getting a glass of wine it's like getting
A f- French glass of wine you know what I'm sayin
yeah
Getting the
It's like getting like not just like not getting wine you're getting
Dom Perignon as opposed to like California sparkling wine
yeah exactly because like you know wines like like a_lot_of people like that are just like they're really
It's that's exactly exactly the same type of thing the conno- connoisseurs
But I suppose these are people who are like connoisseurs of cigars they didn't look like they were doing it to be cool the place was more like a hole in the wall
mhm
Like you c- like you know like you c- you'd definitely know the difference you know
Right
have you have you played at al
I totally forgot how to play are you kidding me I'm so bad at /
Did yo
games but don't tell him that
I think Diane's Diane's played a few times
tell him I play all the time
eh hu
Tell him I play all the time at least once a week
well I always get annoyed because every time we go over his parents house as we're going over there on a Sunday or something he they're all like
All right let's play cards
Let's play asshole when there's all these other games
Or you haven't thought about Ho Chi Minh thing or what did they used to play Pat and those guys
oh Mao
yeah Mao that's right sorry Ho Chi Minh
m- Ho Chi Minh is that's a c- that's a catchy term
I knew it was something like that
And and Tim Harrington cheated for twenty years for the last fifteen years
I know
I know but you know he made the rules so
Isn't that hilarious
I know
I was thinking about them the other day because I thought um
oh because I was thinking for some reason it was such a silly thought I was thinking about architecture and I remembered that
I think they had a nice house
I started looking I was thinking about California style homes
yeah they had a beautiful house I never actually went to it but um I remember Carrie talking about it a_lot
they had a really nice house
it's just modern
yeah it was modern it was sort of silly because it was almost right next door to that
It was Tim's house righ
Crappy house that that Pat lived in
yeah
and it was I think it was right next to that
yeah it was Tim's house and then his
wife moved in
yeah
when they got married I think
yeah she probably took him for half of it now so I'm just joking
Who knows who owns the house
I don't
that other one too that had a really nice house the the one whose husband died
and then she moved to Los Angeles and they never heard hide nor hair of her again
um Arlene was that her nam
oh
oh
She was Asian I don't know whether she was Philippino or what but she was Asian so- some kind_of asian
oh I don't remember who that was
oh
You remember he
uh no I don't remember her
yeah
Because a-
Her husband went down to Mexico
Because Ar- Arlene Arlene was Tim's wife
okay yeah and then there was another one whose /
yeah
whose husband went down to Mexico and caught some
oh that's right
little virus
That's right yeah
And they had a really beautiful house right there too
That was really sad
yeah yeah
Strange little block but then again in that area you sort of they don't people don't really care about
yeah
Big house next to small house sort of thing it's like you take the view as you get it and that's it
yeah yeah
They build it higher and higher
yeah
mhm
well
So how you feeling you feeling
Energetic or tired or how you goin
yeah I'm starting to get contractions now
yeah
Right
Painful contractions
gee god it's going to come so fast yeah you still have two weeks left don't you
yeah but you know probably
Less than oh no less than that
No two weeks it was two weeks yesterday
Ten days
oh
and no I actually had a doctor's appointment yesterday and
Everything is fine my doctor is like the most non
like I don't know whether he's just not interested or he just doesn't care or what but he told me I didn't even have to come in next week if I didn't want to
oh
That he would if I could find someone to take my blood pressure
mm
What was it take my blood pressure and check my urine I think
yeah
I'm like how who the hell is going to take my
I have friends that
where the hell am I going to find someone to do that
Well we when I w- when I had Tyson we had something called share care
hm
because well you said that you don't have private it's all public there isn't
yeah there's no such thing as private here
yeah so I had I
paid for a private doctor and if I had private health insurance I could've had him but I paid for him and
uhhuh
he would just do most of my checkups towards the end like he did it at twenty weeks and then like at twenty eight weeks and then as of about I think the last month
I had to see him once a week now
yeah
I almost could've bagged those visits and and it's a good thing he came to Harvey Bay he doesn't
he doesn't come here anymore now that the the only obstetrician that we have private obstetrician that we have in town is only in Mayorborough and he's
okay
which is a half hour away
yeah
and you basically just sit in the office and you come in and they just take your blood pressure and they talk to you how you're going and they might feel around the baby a little bit and there's no internal exam of course and then that's it I mean I could go to my doctor and do the same
so I'm a little bit torn as to how to go next time as far as a pri- you know going private at at all
yeah I would be so much different if I had a baby again I mean well we do plan actually on having more than one but
yeah
You know I I just I mean I just thought it would be so different I mean I I find that I don't need to see the doctor I have no desire to see the doctor you know
yeah y- you sort of you get you get a bit afraid you know like I I was quite re- you know I was always good with my visits and did my visits and and I sort of realized that
and I thought I would
yeah
uh I I don't think I actually did my followup with Doctor Stokes because oh no I did one followup
uhhuh
but I d- I had to do another one I just didn't show up for that one because
it was sort of ridiculous at that point the the f- the followup that he saw me after I had the baby was
How's the baby how are yo
yeah
How's it going fine well your
I know
That's it see you
I know that's what the doctor does he makes sure that the baby is head down
hm
He takes my blood pressure
and that's it you know and it's like you know by the time you've been pregnant for you know X number of months
hm
y- you're the one who's going to know whether there's something wrong more than the doctor
Yes
I know
So you know it's all up to movement if the baby stops moving then you know you don't call up the doctor you go straight to the hospital
Absolutely
So
yes and that's that's the scary thing isn't it
ohmygod I know I hate it when he stops moving
you
yeah
actually I was a bit bad too because I had you know you had to keep register of the the movement
mhm oh no they don't make us do that
Really oh you had to count and I'd just get really lazy some days and just sort of you know lie on the sheet how many times
well it must have been hard for you too because I know like I sit at my computer all day long
yeah
So you know I can be fairly
Like it's easy for me to tell when the baby is moving but when I'm at home or I'm standing up or I'm walking around you know you just forget
oh yeah
yeah time goes on really quickly I mean I knew he was eh things were still going fine he was he was pretty active actually we're going away tomorrow because we had made plans to go to the sunshine coast with my
uhhuh
parents so then we're go- we're going to go now anyway we
oh
with Tyson and this is going to be
well we we took that trip with Tyson when we went of course to the state
uhhuh
You can't really plan on doing things with the kid you just sort of bring him along and then
in Ja- in January we went
to this resort just across the island and
mhm
That's when Tyson was about
fourteen months and that was a bit of fun because we you know
were staying at a resort and and he was in the pool a_lot and that was a bit of fun but there wasn't much else to do otherwise
So this time where we're going is that there's a_lot_of things to do we're going to take him to this an oceanarium
oh that'll be fun
See the fish and
and seal shows and all this sort of stuff and then you can even
oh that'll be great
oh I know and you can pick up little turtles and all that sort of stuff and I just can't wait
oh
That is going to be so much fun
And
oh and then we're going to the gingerbread factory and that's they have choo choo trains it has an animal park where you can pick up baby animals and oh I can't wait
god
I just can't wait we're going tomorrow morning I was just so excited
that's so funny
I can't believe you're a mother it's
you're going to be calling me up in a year and you're going to go
oh and we're going here and we're doing this and we're so excited and we can't wait
That's great I know
I think no
Right so
there was this one friend and her daughter is
like totally into the Renaissance period
so they go to Renaissance fairs to watch jousting tournaments
ohmygod
I try to describe all that to per- to people I said you know I used to go to renaiva- Renaissance festivals and they sort of like uhhuh uhhuh
yeah
They don't get it huh
ohgod remember that
But that was fun though well I went with you didn't I
yeah we went remember I bought that little /
yeah
thing
do you still have i
oh no it broke years ago yeah
The the fairy
It broke
oh yeah it broke in one of my you know god I don't know who's moved more me or you but we're probably neck and neck
oh
yeah that's too bad isn't it that was a nice little piece actually
but
yeah
hm well
Now is your mother still going to com
yeah she's supposed to come on Saturday
oh wow
yeah it's a little bit of bummer because last weekend was mine and Norm's last weekend alone
and and we had errands to do
yeah
oh
we
so our last weekend alone was filled doing errands
oh that's not good so she's coming until the baby is born obviously
well yeah I don't know what's going to happen she called us
She's going to stay a long time then isn't she
I don't well you know she called up she was supposed come on the twenty eighth which is a week from Saturday you now three days before I was due
yeah
And
She called up about
uh a week and a half ago and asked you know could she come early
mm
because you know I guess she's having problems with Don she didn't
elaborate she just said can I come early
mm
and
you know of course I said well yeah sure why no-
yeah
You know
Do eh do they still go up and down in their relationship
ohgod every six months she calls me up
I'm leaving Don I'm like well that's good mom you know we all
shit
you know whatever you want to do we all love you you know we we want to support you and you know
I've learned not to say anything about bad about Don
mm
uh so we just
you know it's always just we love you we want you to do what you want to do and you know we all support you in your decision
mm
yeah you know and so and then the week and then the and then she'll call up the next week right
And
you know doesn't say anything doesn't even mention that she had an argument
that she was thinking of leaving him you know nothing
uhhuh
yeah wow
yeah
that's too bad
but
yeah you know I'm sitting here and I have this picture I was just staring at this picture over on my
over on my
my bookcase
Like I'm sitting opposite the bookcase
yeah
and I realized it
i- it's a picture of little naked Tyson
naw , naw
That was me
you lucky there ain't no milk in the bottle while you turned it upside down
He getting weaned from the bottle
He only drink it when he really cranky
oh reall
mhm
That ain't bad at all
I told my mother to get a potty chair because I think he would use it
He read
He might be because he
he ain't around no little kids
What I thought he go to a daycare
It ain't no little kid
They're all potty trained and off bottles
He the youngest one there
oh is h
uhhuh
whoa
you know he's
See he going to a home daycare
oh you going to a home daycare
uhhuh
That's good
She ain't got that many kids
uh-uh
See she got
his cousin Shaquille
and Donald
and Donald is five Shaquille is two
Then she got one little boy and one little girl sometimes during the week
Other than that , the rest of them are school age she only have them in the morning and a little time in the afternoon
mm
So I think he probably
f-
g-
if he get a potty chair he probably use it
Is she is she close by yo
mhm
Does she pick him u
oh that's
mhm
She only lives like two blocks
oh that's i
She takes him to school in the morning
oh
mhm
if it get too cold I'm going to just tell her when she bring him home just come swing by there and pick me up
Because you know it's on its way to getting pretty cold
so
uhhuh
temp-
Temperature done dropped already
Alread
just yesterday
it was hot yesterday
So what is the temperature no
About fifty
and I don't miss that at all
ooh I don't miss that weather
I bet you don't
yeah because it's probably about seventy five degrees out here
you uh-uh
mhm
you all miss them storm
I
Girl , no
That's one thing I don't miss , the weather
and I don't miss the all the gangs and c-
crime up in there n- anymore either
0
oh , I would love down there , because yeah they got all of them professional teams down there
Please
Sure
I'm be going to them basketball games all the time
yeah girl you had lied and said you was going to come visit one time
I might be able to
if I if I after my forty five hours I can start applying for scholarships
oh , okay
you know I can't get no student loan
oh you owe them to
uhhuh
Who don't owe the
I'm going to pay them back as soon as I get a job that's worthwhile , though
Believe me
Get them off my back so my credit can start looking good again
you know but you think about all the student loans all the people that got student loans twenty years ago , they ain't thinking about it
They doctors and lawyers now
I know that's and then they not making some of them pay it back
mhm
and they worried about our little twenty five hundred dollars
yup
Make it bad on the people that come down the line , that's all
That is it
you watch the million dollar ma- I mean the Million Man March on T
I watched some of the
speakers and stuff
mhm
My m- I think my mother recorded it
mhm
oh did sh
mhm
I watched some of the speakers and stuff
Wish I could have been there
I know that was something
I thought it was too
whoa
mhm
Just seeing all them black men
in one area
At one time , getting along
yup
Getting along
But you know what the thing about it , if you can organize something like that for a common cause
then you should be able to organize all people to feed off their own
you know
mhm
Shop in their own stores , visit their own malls , you know
yeah that's what I was thinking too
yep
If you can do that
Man if you can get the blacks in the government where they were suppo- supposed to be instead of in prison
yeah
But the whi- w- you know we my
human relations teacher he was talking about that the other day
He said
that w- the laws are catered to rich white men
Of course
and e-
That's why they can do embezzlement for two hu- two hundred three hundred
thousand dollars
a couple of million dollars and go for six /
and get ten months
go for six months come back out still got money stack
mm
and he was talking about
all the drug laws and stuff
it's like slavery
Because he said cocaine and crack is the same thing but if /
the white man get p-
caught with
cocaine powder
he gets five years
Let a black man get caught with cocaine crack /
He get life
He gets twenty seven years
yup
Exactly
and that is not right
and they know it ain't right
Exactly
But that's how it's set up
It's always been that way
and he said and it's rich man rich white man against the minorities
All minorities
and that's true too
Once you start thinking about it
he said the rich man's drug is alcohol and cigarettes
and them the two leader killers
out of all the drugs
It's a hundred and ninety million a year
deaths
Reall
and he said c- and all the rest of the drugs combined it's only two hundred a deaths per year
mm
I was like ooh
But they don't never show them kind of statistics
Of course not
Just like they don't show the statistics that there are more
um white women
on welfare than black folks
On welfare
oh
Always have been
Well they won't show that one
and always will be
mm mm
But they won't never show you that either
mm mm
yeah
Here you go
you should see him Sheri
I just
stare at him

mhm
In amazement , huh
m- m- mhm

uhhuh
After all this time
In um , oh , in the in the envelope that I sent to you ,
uh , there is your map , I'm returning it
and then , there's a book called something about azaleas
and it is really interesting
I never knew it had been written ,
it's written by one of the German Notre Dame sisters ,
no kidding
who went to Dachau every week
to take food , and to take all kinds of messages
ohmygod
and I think maybe she's still living
anyway , ah the name azaleas
attracted me , and then when I read it , I thought , gee this is really interesting
so I thought you'd like to read it , and if you want to send it on to the Dequeens
okay
you know that's fine
but it was really really interesting , I couldn't hardly believe it
hm
oh , I did finally send the package to them
oh , did yo
yeah , but I haven't heard from them , so I don't know
mhm
presume it got there okay and everything
yeah , yeah
well , I haven't heard anything from Frank , whom I wrote to uh in Florida
I did hear from Betty , who is the person in near Green Bay Luxembourg
who is married to a Declean , connected with the Father Decleans
and she's the one that gave me a_lot_of this information , and I told her
that now we found this Robert and Marie , and we didn't know his connection
so I gave her his father's name and his grandfather's name and dates
and I said you know if there's any way you can figure this out ,
and so she said they were going to have some kind_of a reunion
with their immediate family and she would ask , you know , whether anyone knew anything
so , I haven't heard
hm
you know
and where is she from agai
she's from Luxembourg
mhm
but she's not natively a Declean , it's her husband and he's connected with the Father Decleans
oh I see , okay
either the Father Decleans or Jack and maybe it's the same one , I can't remember
you know the Jack shoe shoe perso
oh yeah , mhm
in the shoe place in Green Bay it's either that Jack's family
or it's the two Father Decleans and I don't know which one
mm
well I have greetings from a whole bunch of people ,
when I went to a Chicago meeting
wh
um , we're doing something called Nama North Ameri-
yes , right I think
Major Area okay So I went to the Chicago meeting instead of going to the Milwaukee meeting
so Joanna from Saint Anne's asked about you
oh , no kidding
yes
yeah , ohmygosh
and Sister Anna Marie
oh yeah ,
she a classmat
yes
and Sister Claire
classmate too yeah
and Sister Margaret Rose
yes classmate
and Charles Marie from Alfonse's
Charles Marie
I thought that's what she said
mhm
but I'm not sure
okay , that I can't place immediately
mhm
I mean , I was at Alfonse's but I'm trying to think Charles Marie
or she may have changed her name or something
yeah , that could be
that could be
she just said Alfonse's and I thought oh well
mhm
we'll know what that is
mhm
yeah , she could certainly have changed her name
and then this weekend I saw Sandy ,
and she had talked about their meeting this summer
and I said well Joyce wanted to make that
mhm what um ,
what did she happen to say or maybe you didn't think to ask her , but they manage to get together before Rosario died , or
no , I think Rosario died before
I think Rosario died before , I had asked someone else that
ah I don't know who I asked
but I'm quite sure it was before
oh , okay
but she said they went out to Macquan
and they had a tour
mhm
and she said it was really interesting
mm
we have a thing going at um , at the college there
and it's all about sister Sister six toes
they opened this one room in the basement , and there was something that looked like a casket
and so they just named it Sister six toe
and so when the freshmen come , they tell them about sister six toes and they'd better be good or she's going to get after them
is that craz
just one other rumor we have to overcome
right
right
it's funny because one time ,
0
I have several workers I had last year , several students from
Concordia who came and worked
and worked worked with students with me
and so one day I said well would you give me a tour
and so they took me out and showed me you know
all the things that were different , and all the things that were the same
then we went over to the guest house , um , we were way over on the lake
mhm
and they had like forty or fifty boys in that one little place
like four in a room and double bunks , you know ,
anyway , we were coming up to the door , and I looked down at the mat
and there it said F F N D and I said
wow , and the boy said , well we don't know what that is , it's been there a while , and we don't know what that means
and I said well , I know what it means
huh
you know it means School Sister of Notre Dame
and so then on our way out , he said , do you want to take that with you I said no , I don't
I want it to stay right here , , so you remember us
so it was kind of interesting
party boys
yes do you remember how big that building i
no , but
how small it is
isn't that big , I can remember
I know it , it's awful
I just saw one of the rooms , and I mean it was just body to body and bed to bed
I don't know how they can do it
they'd have to go to the library to study , because they surely couldn't study there
anyway
that was the patron for visitors , right , of
yeah , for yeah
families of , yeah
right , for guests
mhm , gosh
mhm
isn't that somethin
that is
so they have , I didn't know they had ,
residential
oh yes
oh
we have changed all the dorms in the high school
in the candidature , in the novitiate no , not the novitiate the novitiate I think they've kept like as a retreat center
for couples , but the candidature and the asyrinsure
all of the rooms have been converted
all of the dorms have been converted to I I don't know , maybe six rooms
but real walls you know , and really complete
hm
yeah , mhm
and it's boys and girls , I think maybe certain wings are one sex or another , I don't know for sure
but both floors and they have I think they've tripled their enrollment
hm
since they moved out there
no kidding
and they thought they were going to lose
aye yay yay
isn't that somethin-
yeah , I know they thought they were going to lose
yeah
wow
yeah
so it's been a good move for them
for sure , for sure
and today I just got home from , I don't know if you know it but we're
we're in the middle of a big fund drive
as always we're running out of money and
is one of the people who's asking people for money
or
yeah , he did tell me that when he called , yeah
he did he yeah
and um , for that celebration , which is going to be in March I guess for the ending of it ,
we're having a Sisters' choir sing
and I just came back from practice at Elm Grove
with Sister Anne Celine , oh Sister Anne Celine , Anne Celine Doan
yeah
directing us
oh
yeah , and we're doing about four songs from the Mount Mary hymnal
praise be to you oh Lord
ohmygosh
and ah Regina_Caeli and we're doing of course the Magnificat
though it was really ,
so I think we're having maybe four or five practices and then we're supposed to
so I think there are about maybe thirty of us
anyone who wanted to , could you know , join the group
and I missed the first practice , so I thought , hm , I can make the second one
hm
cushy is it
yeah
I sent a card to
I I think it just went out
yesterday before I knew it I just got the idea I put Mayor Mayor Declean
and then underneath I put Mayoress Leona Declean
how cute
oh , that is darling
and I congratulated them both
aw , that's nice
because I really think , you know
yeah
that's all a part of it
yes , and Leona is really
mhm
So fun
yeah I I teach
um one from Mexico
Do yo
But yeah
But he has a hard time remembering
Of course , you know if they don't practice during the week , you know
Right that's w- the most important thing
yeah and then when they
I'm surprised he does-
When they go to work , a_lot_of them are Mexican so then they speak
so they don't get the practice
yeah
yeah oh that's a shame oh
So did you get your wedding pictures and all , ye
No well I got a few snapshots but nothing from the professional
Mom still has them
oh you didn't get
I don't know if sh- she
Did you get to see the proofs then before you wen
No
oh
No they weren't done yet , so
I know it
But Matt , or Leith's friends Matt and Rachel from here took really nice pictures
They have a nice camera
yeah
and really I mean they were excellent
And so they put them all in an album for us and by the time we got back , a- all of his family had seen them and
mm
So they were really pretty and you know nicely done
so we have a pretty good idea of you know
So when are you having a celebration over there or did
We already had it
oh did yo
Whe
yeah
he seventh of October , it was
oh the seventh
yeah it was really fun
Different
It was just real informal party
oh yea
And but his mom and dad did all the work for it
It was really nice
Made lots of little like pick up type foods and
mhm Just like your mom would do
and decorated
yeah exactly and they ma- his dad made the cake
oh his dad made the cake
It was a yeah He made it exact- he made it when Leith was over for the wedding
It was a a fruit cake
uhhuh oh yeah
A very heavy fruit cake and then they have a rolled ice um icing
Like it rolls over the the fruit cake so and then yeah he decorated it too
uhhuh yeah
It was beautiful I was going to send home pictures from that
I know about a week ago they had an article in the paper saying
that some of the latest now is having a cheesecake
oh really
yup , that yeah and having you know like you had flowers and things
yeah
and that was in there
ah
You know instead of having the you know miniature bride and groom
and I cut it out too it also mentions you know about making
making the wedding cake at home
oh
and it when it's brought into another another place
ye- yeah
um you know it's there for inspection
uhhuh
that they can come and inspect your home and that it's oh good thing your mother is not you know stopping to do it
uh
That was in Wisconsin I don't know about Illinois
Maybe
But
so they've probably buckled down on that
yeah
you know , people doing things at home
right
mm
So and then you know some halls won't I mean some yeah some places won't accept those kind
yeah
so
They were almost going to give mama half
uh
then if if people get you know food poisoning they get in trouble
yeah right yeah I suppose that's why
but this was in you know
yeah
uh Milwaukee had that
oh
So
so
Have you seen any koala bear
No I they're not actually they're not over here in
oh they're not
western Australia naturally
oh
but they have a few in zoos
or or petting zoos type things and and so I saw some last time I was here
oh I see
So
so does that go for the ostrich and those too or have you seen some
no the the emu that ostrich type things are here
oh they ar
There's a_lot_of them , yeah
oh so they're like wild
yeah and same and there's lots of kangaroos , too
oh
but but we're a little more near the city so you know we don't see them unless you go out at night
uhhuh
and you go for a drive in the country then you will
oh
yeah but I haven't seen any since I've been back this time because we haven't been out , you know
yeah
out in the bush at night
Louise and I went to the first I think it's the first Friday of September a_lot_of
uhhuh
County zoos have a senior citizen day
I had to work that day but I said oh Sister Louise
uh
what do you say if we go and you know get there for right it started at nine
yeah
I had to be at work at eleven
uhhuh
We went and we made sure we got to the Australian part
oh fun
It was neat because well we w- we went mainly to see the part that was newly constructed
Louise hadn't been there last year and so
uhhuh
I knew what was there the year before
oh right
And so then we went walking we got our walk in so we walked
About an hour and I got
hm
After work just sometimes
as I'm always racing the clock Edna praying for green lights as I go
oh gosh don't you hate that
oh
ah that's terrible
So yeah
oh it's de- the it's definitely a different area here
It's really It's been cool but
You don't have mountains , do yo
No we're in the hills
oh you're in
Where we live right there's a set of like small small hills
oh
and so we live up on a a hill
It's like a little a little hill range , you kno
oh
But there there aren't any mountains
I think down south there are a few real small ones
oh
But there aren't many
And you got a little house is it similar to
yeah
yeah it's yeah
oh
It's about oh no smaller than theirs
It's about their size of their sitting room , kitchen and one bedroom
oh yeah
yeah and so it's not it's not real big but it's attached to someone else's house
mhm oh it's attached
So we kind of go to the back of yeah we go to the back of their house
uhhuh
and and use different doors but the same walkways
and what do they call tha
that's a granny flat
oh a granny flat
yeah
I know when I was in Arizona the a_lot_of times you know the
family would have the big house in the front and then add a smaller house
right
you know
just a short distance behind like in the backyard
yeah
and that was for the for the their p- parents
uhhuh
Yes yes see this was originally built for their parents
oh
yeah
But I think her mom died
oh
So they've been really nice
They're a really nice couple that you know , she she comes and sees me and
mhm
She always wonders if I'm okay being far from home
About how far away is that from your from your inlaw
oh probably twenty minutes
oh
So it's yeah fifteen twenty minutes
It's not bad
We see them quite often
They're real real close family so
yeah
I we we see them once or twice a week
How did grandma enjoy her tri
oh she had a really good time
In fact this is funny her the people from Scotland that she went to visit after
ou- the week she was with us
yeah
um then they came down here for four weeks
oh well that was nice
so they just left last Sunday
oh neat
So I got to spend time with them
They were really nice
hm
Really funny and then they left and she had two Swiss visitors come in
and stay for three days
while they were here
a- right after they left
oh right after /
she was hoping to have a couple days off and
uhhuh
a few friends of Leith's came in and and kind of stayed with them so
mhm
poor lady
she just got rid of all her visitors and
Had had a busy busy week couple weeks so
We just had them over for dinner tonight
oh you di
yeah we had a roast beef and some mashed potatoes and stuff so
That was nice
You know when I talked to your mom the other day , she said something about I don't know there's somebody looking at their house to buy it
yeah
No it's not that way
yeah
So they haven't decided yet
I thought Yvonne was wanted to move there
yeah she had
I don't know I don't know what happened with that
If they just decided they couldn't afford it or
yeah
or what but someone was interested
One of Brenda's friends
Said that she was interested in buying a house and
possibly you know mom and dad
So I think they came and looked at it and then um
Twice they came and looked at it
That's all I heard
And then mom and dad are still deciding whether they want to do that or not
yeah
You know whether
yeah well then I was asking them about last summer
They were saying
that one of the girls would maybe build a house and then they would have a smaller one behind
mhm
but your dad was say- oh I talked to him on his birthday that's when it was
mhm
then they were saying you know that
well if whoever would have it would have to you know buy that land and all that kind of stu-
hm
too you know that
Right
Your dad wouldn't be able to own the land
Right
and someone else build on the you know have the house
The one who builds the main house has to be the owner of the land
Right it can be get kind of sticky
yeah
So I think they wanted to stay away from that
All that red tape all the time
yeah right
Too much yeah
so they wanted to stay away from that and just kind of /
uhhuh
build on their own for now
yeah
You know because they're not ready to move in with somebody , you kno
no no
They're not
But yet you know they don't really need that big house now but
No that's what I said I told mom it's just too hard for mom to keep up all by herself
Well there's nobody there to mess it up
I know but everybody stops over
You'd be surprised
Right yeah
She'd clean it up
We'd both have it cleaned up and then
I know
You know and somebody stops with five kids and it's messy in five minutes
that doesn't take long
No and it's not their fault
She loves them to stop but then she's got to clean it up
have you heard how Sylvia's doin
No
oh
I know she had
Did she have she had her second operation righ
oh did sh
I don't I don't know
yeah I think she did
She looked good at the wedding
yeah she did She came over a few days a f- a few weeks after the wedding , too , before we left and she was fine
She was doing real good
oh that was before she had her second surgery , then
Right right
and they're going to be here
well
if I come out to visit you that will make it easier too , I can /
see them at the same time
When are they going to b
um , well , she goes to Wilston Northampton
uhhuh
And they she said
um the mom
I just spoke to her a few minutes actually
sh- I suppose I was talking to her when you tried to call
um
been a busy night
m-
um
I think she said sh-
they're coming maybe on the twenty ninth
So and I told them if they needed any help
okay
um
you know
I I kind of I can't make any plans for the twenty ninth until I know
mhm
Sure no that's fine
But
but basically , I mean
heck it might turn out that you know if they fly in to Boston I can
drive them /
To western Mass
out to western Mass and
visit you on our way to New Hampshire
Well
Right
I don't know
I want you for more than a couple of hours
So
yeah
No , no
I'm talking about more than a couple of hours
um
Cory and Paula
will also be with us for Christmas
Wow
But
really
anywhere almost anywhere in that whole time frame I'm home
Y'all could come out
okay
So
yeah
Is there any time that's better than any othe
Well Christmas day probably wouldn't be the best
yeah
But it wouldn't be that bad
yeah
um , just try to think I
e- Cory usually the way they have us sleeping is Cory and me in my room
and Paula in the back room
But we have put Paula in
the living room
So actually there would be room for
all of us to be there
yeah but she shouldn't be kicked out for
No , I mean , Paula sometimes sleeps in the living room
I think it may be a more comfortable mattress
I mean /
ah
it wouldn't be kicking her out
That's Paula's normal place to sleep when she's
so
okay
Well
um
e- my
So it n- it really doesn't matter , I guess
okay
My my schedule is definitely
I don't want to subject you to Christmas
I mean I don't , know
But
um well that's
probably not the best
they
I have to
see you know how Nathaniel's feeling /
Absolutely
yeah
about being social
Sure
um but I know he very much
would of course like to see you
I mean that just depends like the if we come before Christmas or after Christmas
mhm
mhm
What I could definitely see happening is a post Christmas pre New Hampshire /
okay
visit
Something like the twenty sixth to the morning of the twenty ninth
Or
That would be so lovely
Or something like that
That would be so lovely
yeah
And we could just play
Ye- we could just play
And all three of us will need to do so
yeah
yeah
You're right
I'm so glad I'm going to get to see you again so soon
I feel spoiled
Yes I know
Is this like a treat or wha
I just saw you in August
hey this moving back to this continent thing has it's /
i- it really does
It really does
has its
pluses
oh
yeah
It's going to be good
yeah
So oh yeah like another thing , this is I don't know how close we're getting to our thirty minutes , this is not something to like drop on you , but and it's not like I'm thinking about doing it right now
mhm
yeah
Although there's a story about what I am thinking about doing right now
Anyway
You're getting married
yes
No
God no
But I'm having major baby pangs
Like
Wait , is this what you were going to drop on me or
Well I mean it's not , this is the thing that I'm not going to do like tomorrow but
okay
um
but at some point when I'm somewhat more established
I mean for so long I was sure I didn't want to be a mother
And now
I really think I do
I think I want to have a baby
And like be a mom
oh
Great
yeah
So
and
every time I say it
Because one of my friends has to have a baby before I do
Every time I s- oh I don't know if it'll be before you
Every time I say it Heather says
I'm not ready to think about that yet r-
I told her I'm not think about it tomorrow
But you know this is just something I'm thinking about and I think I want to do it
And the other night she said you know /
I think I might want to be a mom too
So we may each be moms for no like /
Wow
where we're going to find the dads
But
yeah
mm
That's a problem
Could be
yeah
ouch
But
But
I don't know
I mean it would be interesting if my brother were willing to donate
eee
For
Heather
yeah
Because then it would be it would have some blood
God
And some McNealy blood
But she doesn't have any acceptable male relatives
so
Wow
Anyway
yeah
So there's that
And
but that's not like
you know news of the moment or anything
That's just something I'm thinking about that I wanted you to know
And
the other thing is I've been thinking about and I I think I've pretty much just decided not to do it but
I was thinking about being an egg donor actually at a local /
Wow
reproductive medicine clinic
um
largely because it paid fifteen hundred dollars
But I went in for the preliminary exam
um an interview
did that just yesterday
and
Aside from it sounding kind of scary
I mean I could probably do scary for fifteen hundred dollars
um
it's like a two to three month process , which I don't have
So
oh
yeah
So but I did find out that I have
acceptably positioned ovaries
And
so you know maybe at some point in the future
huh
Kind of sucks though
The fifteen hundred dollars would have come in handy
Well there's always San_Francisco
Right
Right
I figure it's probably not exactly a novelty out there
So
that's something I may do at some point in the future
Though e- on my way home on the bus I'm thinking
I'm like selling my body here
They call it oocyte donation but they pay you fifteen hundred dollars to do it
yeah
So it's not really donation
That's very interesting
It is interesting
It's not some-
It's a very interesting process really
Really
yeah
I mean they explained like how they use the hormones to
like turn off your ovaries and then
overstimulate them and
then how they harvest the eggs
Which is not exactly a pleasant sounding experience
yeah
I I kind of heard something about that
mhm
So
I had a vaginal ultrasound which was really interesting
So I like saw my ovaries on the little screen and
Ugh
oh it didn't hurt
It was easier than a pelvic
ohgod I have to go in and have one of those
I haven't had one in over a year now
I usually have them every August
Sorry
yeah , I have them in the spring
yep
sorry
Didn't mean to bring up a bad thing
No that's okay
I've been meaning to do it for two weeks i-
Just when do I have the time
yeah
You know
So true
so
So Becker is sounding better to me
yeah actually she's coming to see me again
oh good
yeah she's coming next weekend
So you're not coming out to see me huh
hu
Th- this fall you're not coming out to see me
e- I I'm
sorry
No
The last time we talked you you thought you might
It was a possibility
I know
I thought I'd love
okay
to
but I think
I think there's probably
ohmygod
It's okay , Tasha
No it's okay
See part of what's
see I have this
big paper that I'm really excited about that I'm going to do about ten times
too much work on which is a good sign because that means that I'm doing like my e- /
like as well as I did in Mount Holyoke
Right
e-
e- that I I just
actually I don't know
like
if I'm going to do a good job on it but I'm really excited about it
that's going to like take up as much time as possible till December sixth
m-
I'm also having , from the time Becker comes
well Becker comes for one weekend in November
Good
And then my
pare- my mom comes
something like
the twelfth , or something for Thanksgiving
ohmygod
I don't know she's going to be here for some
ungodly long time
And then your d- is your dad coming out to
yeah he th- he's coming out the morning of Thanksgiving he and my brother will arrive and th-
they'll only n- the
the day after all of them leave
Ursula is coming
oh wow
to stay for a week
So November is like
ohmygod
I mean in a way it's really good because it will get me to when Nathaniel gets b-
because this month has been s-
so long
yeah
I have never experienced
such a long month in my life
oh
I know what you mean
July was like that for me
yeah
yeah
um and in a wa- I mean
November will fly it seems and after that I can tell myself you know well
December is here it means Nathaniel is coming home now
That's right
And I might as well save myself that
way for twenty one days
Sure
um
but
i-
but
i- on the other hand I'm really scared because I have all this work
The the
Right
The main thing is this anthropology class that I'm having trouble
hm
with
You know I take
two ah about a month just in the writing of a twenty page paper , not talking about any of the research
mhm
Right
And
w- th-
cla- this anthropology class has
this paper that's due on Monday
a five page paper a twenty page paper and a final take home exam
Which seems a little heavy but anyway
um
That does seem rather heavy
yeah
The thing is that the the papers are cumulative in a way
so I can't start on the twenty page paper until after I turn in the five page paper /
oh
Right
Right
which is scaring the shit out of me
Beyond that the day after that paper is
due , I have my take home final for my law class due
And
I hate to I mean
e- this is like completely different from the whole discussion that you and I had on this , and I will never admit to my parents who felt I should take the sociology class
this /
but
I was right to
take the law class for the reasons that I was considering
mhm
But my mind is not interacting with that information
uhhuh
Like it's not that I don't understand it
It's just like my mind is not picking up and saying oh this is interesting what about this and this and this and like nothing's ha-
Right
Right
oh I'm sorry
Dead
Besides that I manage to make the stupidest comments of the year every time I open my mouth in that class
oh I hate that
So I just sit in the back
or actually I sit in the front row which is awful
Because then I feel like everyone is looking at me
They're all thinking I'm stupid
And
e- I it's really weird
I think people must because
the way people sit
I am /
isolated
oh
Like no one ever sits in the row where I sit
So I'm like ohmygod , I'm a law school leper
yeah because
different things the way they are said here than in contrast to the way they'd be said in other countries
yeah
yeah Your Columbian Spanish won't work , hu
yeah so yeah
I know And she said she could when I in talking she said I can tell that you were taught
By Castilians
oh ah
You know just the way you say different things
yeah she can t- so it was it's been interesting
Now , where did you start off , anywa
In Columbia , in Bogota , Columbia
oh , I see
Well that was good
And then and then go- Gordabatca , which was a little different
uhhuh mhm
And they've got expressions that aren't used down here and visa versa
yeah yeah
So it's been I mean it's it's interesting just being you know getting clued in to the Chilean way
yeah we had a a professor from the University Madrid
who was on campus for a while at Rosemount
mhm
and she was a Castil- what do you ju- call a Castilian of the Castilians
Vicks mhm the T H the T H
oh I'm telling you yes and every once in a while she would say something in sort of Spanish
oh you're like wait for me
She was awfully nice
I love it
really
aw
really yeah
So how does your family feel about you being this down here in Chil
oh
it's so so
It's interesting because most of the family was really excited and in fact
Francis and Rich would like to come down at some point Tricia teaches Spanish up in Alaska
oh terrific
She would like to come and work in a sh- to do an- and then also
and bring her suits , right
um Nancy , Ted's wife
um is a Spanish professor
And so she would like to come down
hm
and te- you know she goes just to take just to have the time to be there not
necessarily to do anything but just to be able to interact with the people and all
yeah and talk yeah
so right and talk right so
you
ah the three of them
which
you know would like to
would you have
uh my mom
Sorry
yeah
okay my mom would like to k-
so I guess they
you can't talk at the same time
oka
I'm okay I'm being quiet now
It's your turn
okay
Because I keep getting I keep getting i- I ke- it keeps shutting off
Can you hear tha
No
oh okay well I'll anyway my mom would like to come down
But h- her comment was when I was leaving she goes well I'll give you at least two weeks and then I'll check you out
oh
b- But she has h- I I doubt if she'll come
oh if it would be this year if she comes
oh
It'll probably be some time next year
yeah yeah
so
Well , your sister Karen lives in Portland
Is that correc
Yes
or well at any rate , Roseanne went out for the one hundred fiftieth , you know , holy child jubilee
Yes
celebration and she said it was Karen your s- I can't remember her last
mhm
She said she would
Karen Day
She yeah she was in charge of it and she said it was very very nice
oh good
Karen did a wonderful job
yeah
It's great
oh good
And my sister , Therese , played the piano for the celebration
oh gee you know more about it than I do
Well see I because it was Therese's birthday
oh I didn't realize that
And since Karen was in charge of the whole thing , our practically our whole family got involved as far as getting things ready
uhhuh
We worked on the mailing and we did
uh any of the organizational part Karen kept getting Francis or or Therese or Monica or whoever was around just to help her out
mhm mhm
But then they said th- my mom also said that at the mass I think Francis and Karen were both Eucharistic ministers , as well
oh
So it was very nice
Boy a family affair , hu
Right
So well I'm glad to hear I mean it's nice to hear from other people , too , that it was a nice
a nice time because you never kno- , you kno
yeah yeah right well , you know , families are biased , right
Yes ,
how is your mothe
So she's doing okay to a certain extent
She's just found out she has glaucoma
aw
so she has to they're
well is it
is it
go ahead
is it is it treatabl
Because sometimes they can just do surgery for that
Well , right now I don't think she's thinking of the surgery but she uh she's doing some drops
yeah
and it's an experimental drug that they're going to try for two weeks to see what happens
oh uhhuh
but see , her the reason why she I mean she finally went and got her eyes checked She was driving
um the week before I went out to visit her , she was driving and driving down the middle of the lane
oh oh
and she went through she went through two stop signs and never realized that she had gone through them
oh
So it was a little scary
yeah yeah
but she ye- and she finally said I'm I won't drive at night anymore
Well the whole time I was home , she never drove
uhhuh
You know , she just kept she just kept asking me to drive , which was fine
yeah yeah
but then she finally got her eyes checked and she does have glaucoma , so
mhm oh I hope they can do something for her because she's just so active
yeah
God , wears you out
I know I know
true
mm
gee it was so nice to have you all here
so
for your jubilee
You know you're you're mother's extraordinary
mm
That was fun
and she
and she had never been in Rosemount Aries
So it was a neat experience for her and for Monica
oh
uhhuh
so
yeah to see what what's going on and ah anyway , well
How are you doin
Fine we're
oh good
the library is getting automated
ooh , perfect
yeah yeah and they're looking for a name for the catalogue , you know , the online catalogue ,
uhhuh
Libraries get fancy when it comes to naming it , for example the
mm
the New_York Public Library , theirs is named Catnyp
C A T N Y P
oh perfect
yeah I think that that's the most clever I've heard so far
uhhuh
and then somebody else has Holy Family College has The Family Cat
uh
You should have a contest at the college
But we are
oh good
and it's it's open to all students , faculty , staff , administrators and S A C J
oh perfect , well
So if you want so if you want okay
I'll start thinking
okay
but think quick and send it right away
okay Rosenip , ok-
Does it have to end in ca
no no anything you want at ju-
oh alright
something that is you know unique and short
uhhuh mm
and has something to do maybe with the trend- tradition of the college something like that
okay
and the pri- the prize is a one hundred dollars gift certificate to Borders which is a marvelous bookstore
alright
You can come up here and spend it righ
oh that would be fun
Or I could spend it for you
That would be fun
You'll have no trouble I I'd be glad to hand it over because I doubt if there's a Borders down here
yeah and I'm sure that it'd be pretty safe to think that Anyway , you can submit as many as you want
you know as many entries as you want
If it's an acronym , please explain what it spells
okay
okay
Somebody has some college I've forgotten what it is has L I B R I S you know , for books
uhhuh perfect
and it's the letter it's the letters of the of the college you know the library information da-dum da-dum da-dum system
how cle- oh neat smart okay
yeah so anything like that
perfect
and I think oh please keep praying for well money
mm yeah
that's what we need money
We al- we also need students , so if you have any students that you'd like to send up
oh okay
and
Do you How is the new person doin
Very very very very very well
yeah
oh good
Terrific
People really like her and she's so
oh good
honest and forthright and she's really a a most extraordinary person
oh good mm
and and she is so dedicated to Rosemount It's really amazing
um
One thing that is a problem is the money
mm
yeah and so if she can get money , then everything will be fine but it's
mhm Now is she responsible for that hersel
Well , it to a certain extent yes yeah she really ha-
mm you don't have a de-
We don't have well we've lost a_lot_of people so we don't have a good development group at all
mm
I mean there there should be someone in charge of that but there there isn't
mhm
but her background is very much in finances
oh wow
she was chief financial officer at Bryn Mawr College
mhm
So she really knows money
mm
But i- you know getting it out of people is is not ea-
yeah
so keep praying for that

For a teaching job
But I and so I've tried a couple times by calling it but I there's always a machine or nobody at home
uhhuh
And so I quick hand up as soon as I hear the machine so I don't even actually know if it's her machine
and
Because I don't want to get charged for talking to her a machine
Exactly
That's what I do too when I call the states
So
You don't have a machine , righ
Well , I do now just because you know because
But what when do you use it on the fourth rin
yeah , it's on the fourth ring yeah so hang up after like three rings and
okay
I'll know to hang up if you don't get it before then
um yeah because we were getting because I was getting so many calls back like on interviews or or things that I you know I didn't want to miss them
On that you were missing yeah
and of course Roberto the other day when we had this in- installed uh erased the a message
and he said well somebody was calling because you hadn't
oh sent your resume
oh , have any idea who it was
No
oh okay
Could be one of any fifty people
Well , no problem
Don't bother to answer the phone anymore , Beto
I'm going to but a machine
yeah
I know no an-
So but anyway
oh boy and you just you missed the earthquake ohgod it was so frightening
yeah really
God I've never been so scared in my life
I've never felt anything that strong
Reall
It was that bad
Well we were
why I think s- yeah some friends had come over to watch a movie and then they had gone home and we were just
sitting around watching the news or something and all of a sudden Pedro goes
There was just this earthquake in in so we like we called his mom at like twelve o'clock at night or something and
and she was like yes we're still here
We're still shaking and now it's pretty scary here
yeah
It was
It wa- ah you know I was with Martine and Patty and we went downtown
mhm
You we never go out well on Friday nights okay so we went to the on to the East side and all of sudden you know we I look at Martine looks at me and I said
We're out of here
But it's it started re- it didn't start real real
Real strong
strong
It was just was like it
But not
Hello
what
I don't know I I'm getting up
No
But anyway so so we got out but by the time we got out I mean the pavement was fucking
yeah
it was just like
oh that there was this I remember this truck it was ju-
bouncing up and down like somebody had it like on a yoyo
oh my goodness
No it was just like super frightening
And nothing happened to your house or an-
Well I mean some things fell off the shelves and stuff and you know
good yeah no
No nothing no no no no and then the the funny thing or the frightening thing was I couldn't all of a sudden Patty goes where's Estefa
And I go oh yeah where's Joe
runs and you know and everybody out of the restaurant and and you know typical typically looking Mexican I don't appreciate it
yeah
we're being taped but nobody went back to the restaurant to pay
oh
They all split
fixed up for it you know it was like a a a deserted island when we went back to finish our meal
We actually went back
oh you did so
sat down
Finished our meal
We wa- we ordered tequila but he says we- uh I I'm sorry but I can't give that to you because the bottles are broken or something but
oh oh you di
But we were we paid for our meal but we were the only ones who went back can you believe it and the restaurant was full
oh my goodness
Where were yo
But anyway , hu
down- downtow
It was called Es_Lestablos_Swisse or something
oh
I mean anyway I mean the food was good and stuff but you know
yeah
It wasn't it was strong but it wasn't that I i- I mean everybody just
yeah
I mean
Panic
how long would it have taken to go back and say how much do I ow
yeah yeah yeah just throw some money
but anyway so so how are the girls liking it and stuff Roy
oh they love their school an- and they both get got real good teachers and Steffi's Steffi's teacher has real horrendous spelling I mean
She was at my first parent teacher conference at
you're joking
eh she was showing me they're learning letters and sounds
mhm
so she says oh yes we were writing down N words
she had written down necktie N E A K T I E and
Good Lord that
ah an n- necklace after that was also spelled
with an
terribly wrong and so I just I pointed out necklace and then I
said ooh wait there's more I said well I better stop counting
We'd better
but in the least
I'm just glad that he's for not first grade teacher
No yeah but she's but she's really a wonderful peppy lively you know
mhm
Fun per- fun person and you know Steffi is really happy
in and Elise's teacher is wonderful really really nice just just
adorable lady that you know just oh ah Elise is so sweet and I just love her and she's such a good student and blah blah blah
yeah
She's just you know and she's really
good I mean ah I Elise is
Elise is like reading books like crazy
She's like Mom I don't know I just love reading now and I just you know she's really
Well that's wonderful
She's really excited about school so and and she's you know she's made some friends here both of them
and
but in the neighborhood there's there are two kids that live across the street that go that go to a private Catholic school close to here so they don't go to the same school
but like the boy is in second grade and the girl is in sixth grade and they and they play really well with Elise and Steffi
and then there's another little girl who stays with her grandma till her mom picks her up after work who's in I think she's in first grade
and she's comes over here almost every day too to play with them and stuff , so
So they're you know they're they're basically pretty happy since um you know they like their school and they're
Well that's that's that's yeah Sylvia it sounds like the
yeah
Only monkey or the the yeah
yeah y- you know mhm
It yeah well yeah I we should have known
Well did you hear the horror stor
Well he was there for like a mo- like the forty day
From
oh well this is
He was supposed to be there for five days right but of course the tests showed that he had
pyro-
plasmosis
which is a blood disease
And what is tha
a blood disease
mm
Of course
This had to happen of course
But that was like major trauma and we were having major problems because of this major trauma
It was alright till you
And so
And finally then he yo- you know calls all over Mexico and all over Texas blah blah blah to find out do you know whether you can treat this or not
finally finds out from his in Tuzla that oh sure you can treat that don't worry blah blah blah
So he goes down but to make sure he actually you know treats it and gets rid of it , he a- he goes down twice
in the rain stays overnight for a night or two each time
no two or three nights each time at hotels and stuff and then
and is giving this treatment to this
horse and blah blah blah comes back then goes back down , gives him another treatment and then comes back then has to go back down for when they take the
blood out again after another two weeks
What a nightmare
So and
what a nightmare
yeah and
He was the horse was there for like six weeks ah you know costing us you know more than much more than we had ex-
than the horse is worth
that we had ex- wa- wanted
You know much definitely much more than it was worth to me
And and but finally it did get cured
and so what the second time they they approved it to come across the border blah blah blah
And the only sort of good thing that happened in relation to that horse so far is that
in looking at stables and stuff around here it turned out somebody said there's a stable real close to your house
but they're very expensive
So we go there I said well let's just
go look at it and see if maybe we can strike some kind of deal with them or whatever
turns out that these people are their daughter was kicked in the head last
last year by a horse and was in a coma and so they're like have major bills and stuff , too
but they wa- they're building a new stable an- and want to build a new house and stuff
mhm
So they we made a deal with them but Betsy would drop their plans for this
ah
this place in exchange for the first month
uh rent and board
mhm
and it is right down the street from our house
It's really really incredibly convenient for Beto
But now they're they're leasing this property they're on and Beto says they're moving by the middle of November
So now we have this other you know dilemma now where's he going to put it now and he's
tonight he's off to a meeting
With some here that and he's going to see if he's going to
Did he hook up with some people he had met befor
uh no no
hm
Well actually he'd actually some of these people that he eh one of these guys whose
going with to the meeting with tonight actually said that he knew
a that Beto knows in Tuzla
uhhuh
Not one of his friends , but someone someone that Beto knows in Tuzla
So it's kind of funny he said what a small world , you know
um because this this guy apparently used to live in Guadalajara and knew this guy , too but isn't that funn
And so wait so he's still but I can't why can't he find a jo
Is there no jobs for him or wha
Well first of all because he's got blue blood you know so
oh because I was going to ask you about Michael and Megan if they came in August
If they did , I didn't hear from them
oh because Susan had said they were going to , hopefully go
Well they we- she was waiting for their father to send them some money so that they could go for the month of August
Because I guess there was going to be a wedding and so forth
But I
oh , if they came we didn't hear about it
oh well I haven't talked to Susan since spring time or when Mae got home
yeah
So
So well I understand why
somebody would be really ticked at me seriously ticked
yeah well sh- she's forgiven that
So
Along with all the other stuff that went on
Well
so and Mae's one of the few people that Krissy even feels she can talk to
oh well
So maybe because her life isn't as messed up as Mae's
Not quite not quite as messed up
Makes her feel good
I don't know
Boy , sounds like Mae's is really messed up
yeah
yeah
fucked up Aziz Is going to Abu Dhabi
oh she i
for soccer
Well now that she's finished getting rid of her appendix , she doesn't have to worry about that this year
oh
so she's going to Abu Dhabi on
um junior varsity team
When for wha
for soccer
junior varsity for wha- socce
soccer yeah
okay
J V soccer and then she's going to go out for varsity basketball
and they're going to go to Damascus but that'll be by ah bus
that'll be next quarter
um when is she going to Abu Dhab
uh the end of this month
hm
uh maybe no wait maybe it's the first of December
Ag-
yeah parts partly no- end of November It's the last week in November Decem- in first of December
mm Well I'm writing this down so I can tell daddy everything
Sa-
some
yeah
uh well that's good
um I
did Kitty tell you that I mentioned to father that
We we are going to go to Jordan ah next summer
You did and what did he say
He said you know and I said you know I'm thinking that we could go and see
um oh what's her name in Austria for two or three da-
uhhuh
huh
yeah
for two or three days and then go on to Jordan
and then we'll take a little trip for maybe a week before we come back
Something like
going on a barge along the canals in either France or Germany or Holland
and he said
ooh that sounds nice
huh
That sounds nice
oh one of those countries
I said that I've heard about these trips
and walk along side or run along side or beat the b- barge to the next bridge or whatever you know
huh
yeah
but that you can they because they go so slowly
and I said it would be a wonderful relaxing trip after having been to Jordan
And he says and who is going to pay for thi
and because he had told me before it would cost us about five thousand dollars to go
yeah
And so I said my mother and father are going to pay for it
I said I have never spent any of that money that they left
and they are going to pay for this trip
he says oh
like okay
oh okay
So anyway , doesn't that sound goo
sounds great to me
I I'm going to call a travel agent , which I have not done yet , but a travel agent who
gets trips going for North Jesco for women
yeah
and ask her if she's got anything really interesting that these two old folks would like to do one in good condition and one not and
then I'm going to work on our passports and stuff so that you know I would suggest that you don't tell the kids yet just in case this falls through
okay
but if I you know as I learn stuff I'll let you know
okay
okay
Sounds good
yeah
Ye- and
We- we'll start preparing
Well , you know think about it
I don't know what you have to do to prepare but just think about it
Well we we got the car
oh I was going to ask you about that
oh yeah the girls now wave goodbye to their friends instead of hiding under the seat
Hell everybody's hap- It gets dusty all the time time because it's
oh
dark blue one
You drive with your lights on because it's people can see you
No everything's pale around here so the dark blue shows up real well
no you still drive with your lights on because if you go into a shadow
yeah
you then people can still see you
oh well Not too many shadows here
yeah
um the Some sweet small child
drew a Star of David on the front hood this morning
oh that didn't go over
I said oh good nothing like making us a target , guys
That should go over well
I okay this is nice , you know
so I I kind of changed it a little bit made it a little pointy
rubbed the edges
oh great I figured it's time to start out WASP
oh which reminds me which reminds me you said e- in one of your letters all the kids at
in your class and how they speak different languages
uhhuh
and somebody speaks Hebrew
How di- how did that person get in ther
because we have a new diplomatic mission in Amman
Tha- oh because of the peace process
Right
oh
So I have I have Yanni Atar and Inbal Lavi
Two little kids
yeah one is is in the kindergarten section
uhhuh
That's Yanni and Yanni's a little stinker
Yanni San Jonathan and but he's he's come along pretty good actually he was born in Brooklyn
oho really
uh
Spent the first three years of his life in in New_York and uh
So he's this is all coming back to him
He's heard a_lot_of English he just hadn't used it
very much but it's like in the back of his mind so he's beginning to use it
mhm
and doing pretty good when he listens ha ha
And when he doesn't , he's all over the place
mhm
He sits there and talks
yeah and what where's the other little where's the other little ki
Is this a a siblin
No Inbal is
Lavi her last name is Lavi and she's in the preschool section
and she is she's often in another world
She has not
got a clue about English at all
um but she she's coming along , too , though
um well Hillary said the other day
Inbal knows a little bit of English
and I said oh reall
What makes you think s
She says well
When she pointed to the ball she said it was brown
and when Mrs
Farhun asked her to go get Abrahim , she said Abrahim
oh
I said well she's got two two words , Abrahim and brown
yeah right and what was the other language a language I never heard of before
that some kid spok
Indonesian
No Indonesia
oh
What's the name of the languag
What's the word for tha
I don't
I don't know it was just Indonesian
th- oh well the other one , Hindi
No
Or Urdu Urdu
it's Urdu
Urdu is is an Indian language
Urdu is an Indian languag
uhhuh
oh
yeah I have ya- Anne Kit Panda
But like most of the upper class Indians , he speaks English
yeah
British English
yeah
With a real slant to it
hm okay
But we kind of figured that between Leslie who speaks British English /
mhm
High British English /
mhm
and Carrie who's from Texas /
and me
Between the three of us
when the kids get out of our class , they'll be able to understand anything
Right That reminds me that you know I co-teach with Pat
Pat's from the east coast
No , I don't think she has an accent
Once in a great while I can hear something , but she
She and I speak very much alike , very similar , I think
pronouncing words
I'd say you're from too
Well , anyway , l- last year , one of our students said
uh you and Gloria speak pronounce things differently
and Pat thought that was really sharp of her , that she had that good of ear , that she could
tell we pronounce things slightly different
yeah we're always talking about words that we pronounce differently
But anyway the girl who's working with him she's said if you could send her some assorted information about emus
Definitely
They'd be pleased to get anything you've got
Definitely better
because they they were sort of checking things out here a little bit about emu apparently there's no
um
commercial emu raising in the country this is one of the problems is this they can't th- the problem is slaughtering them
No that's state was weird because I can't imagine it whatever place slaughters
Because that's the prob- that's the p- that's the problem here too in the United States is the slaughtering of them
ostriches I wa-
yeah
eh the U S Dems- Department of Agriculture Leary is setting up a lye affecting industry they're interviewing pressure by government agencies
hm
I mean there are places but it seems it not so much it's hard to do
But just like they needed to be classified as livestock first they're going for human consumption
No but why wouldn't they be able to slaughter to get it with the ostriches if ostriches are being slaughtered
I would think they would well I can no I got all kinds of stuff I could mail her do so- does she speak English too or
yeah you can mail English stuff I mean that's
okay yeah
yeah
Or you can just mail it to me and then I'll pass it on
okay I- I'll definitely mai- mail away my emu magazines as well
okay
yeah
and wha- tell me whatever was the end with the electricity in your house
Pardo
What was the problem with the elec-
oh it was a freak thing basically it vibrated
uh oh it was called a dead short
oh wire came loose on a main ground line inside and the whole system just shut down which is normal
Where was the wir
took them
up in the attic crawl space very hard to get to
Do you mean like maybe just even reverberations from the fan or something
Probably that what he thinks he just you know he just happened to happen to write down unrelated to current surge said it's a very unusual thing to happen
mhm
Anyhow as it was there there was no fire hazard from it because they grounded it right out but you know no one
took him fore- you know he did not find it then and then we came back took almost four hours to locate finally where it was
Wow wow
But anyway you replace that and a couple other circuits on it
uhhuh
and change a few things on the wiring too but as I said it was just a weird thing where it actually
disconnected very poorly put on it wasn't really fastened the proper way
yeah how much did you have to pay for it
A hundred and twenty which is very reasonable
mhm yeah
you spend I mean that's counting parts too that's way way below the normal rate
right yeah
then he's going to help me do a few things on the bottom the snow is like so steady and I could hardly see
oh yeah it sounds nice
It wasn't even on the forecast
mm
said a chance of flurries there's like an inch and half of flurries on the ground
oh oh is sh-
and the flowers are still up which is really pretty I'll have to photograph it tomorrow
hm that's neat
Let's see what else I still appreciate what you did with the computer I'm still learning stuff there
Well , okay that's good
haven't progressed too much her kids Abby's kids know it pretty well the older kids
reall
but they got right into games and stuff and where they were and how to bring them up I didn't know I had these games there
uhhuh
well they go right to the program right into it
yeah do you think they probably came installed with the
yeah
But they know I mean how to find and how to bring it up and the games they've finished are like still there for them to continue working with
mhm mhm
but I have no idea how they do it and actually I don't care because I don't use them
Which of the kids are playing with it the the girls or the older boy
Two the two boys
uhhuh yeah
yeah
Have they come up more than a couple times to you alrea-
oh about three time well the whole family I think twice together
and Abby stopped by a couple times with
one of the kids and friends of
I'm blanking on his name
Avi
Avi Avi's friends
He has a few Israeli friends in visiting
yeah
uhhuh
One of the guys I can- r- real pleasant guy I'm fr- I met him once in Israel I can't think of his name offhand very very pleasant
I don't know who els
yeah
Not Eli
oh maybe
Eli Sha- is
uh is he t- tallish
tall is I think a little bit graying already
yeah I think that's might be who it is
They're those cute
Because I know Eli lives in Boston now maybe is out there visiting Avi and they were b- best friends
eh
I think that's who
I think that's who it was
He's got a couple of kids I- I don't know if he's with
yeah I'm pretty sure because they were here here he was here was for like ten minutes passing through real quickly
eh so it's possible he came to see Avi then
yeah
and let's see nothing else much I figure I better use up the phone call here you know before it runs out no
yeah
trying to think of what else
I'm trying
My columns are progres- I mail some of my columns again soon
uhhuh
What's the postage by the way at Israe
What do you mea
Did it go u
I don't know that's the Americans would know
I had my first thing returned insufficient postage
You're kidding
yeah a card to
uh Elon
hu
Maybe it was overweight
No I don't know it came b- it came back two days ago I had the usual whatever I put on it
and I'm puzzled unless the rates went up and I didn't know it
I don't know
You know or it gets screwed up and came back by mistake
I I'm not sure
By the way we even have U P S now but that's probably expensive I don't know what it costs U P S overseas
Probably expensive yeah
yeah
It's funny this phone connection is not the greatest kind_of a it's space is a space between it
yeah and I hear a little bit of noises in the back-
yeah
yeah
Maybe it's just with storm I me- probably it's quite a quite a snow storm coming down
that's what I miss
oh it's pretty
um h- how are the chic- are the chickens still giving lat
They're out walking yeah their layings well I was getting almost an egg a day for I have eight
eight eight hens I got rid of all the roosters but one
and now they're laying about two weeks the slow the laying down I get maybe three eggs out of all of them every day which is fine
you know
ah three eggs a day tota
er
total
uhhuh
Ye- if I put a light in to give them artificial light they'll pick way up
but until I get the wiring all done I don't want to do that
reall
mhm
How's the how's the Aztec doin
uh
loves it first day out in the weather just was running around all playful like almost playful with the the dog and the goat will walk together now
oh reall
yeah they'll walk they'll walk side by side kind of ignoring each other but if either one stops the other one will wait
That's funny
so they kind of enjoy each other's company but don't really hang out and once in a while Aztec will butt Fritz which Fritz doesn't like trying to be playful
y-
um
I forgot there was a while back when the week was starting to sh- no we decided that she wants a labrador retriever or a golden retriever
She tried working on saw there was no
oh
Was no chance
thought maybe she'd check with the next door neighbors didn't work and then she decided well in that case
then she's going to go to America live with Uncle Johnny
oh
and and either Fritz will die pretty soon if not she'll kill Fritz
and then Johnny will buy a labrador retriever for her
and then he'll buy her anything she possibly wants and also then she'll find find a nice girl for him to marry
okay tell her maybe la-
and Fritz
you know that if you find if y- if you find Johnny a nice girl to marry then maybe Johnny won't be able to buy you anything you want anymore
Well tell h- tell her we're try to sell her actually the vet gives Fritz about a year
No he's healthy but he's at times he's just totally co- I've re- I really think he's almost like th- the equivalent of like dog's Alzheimer's
Really
at times he seems real confused he's out walking he just stops looks around and like
Like what am I doing here you know and his hearing is not any is is very very bad his hearing got bad real quickly
Well it's interesting that he and the goat are sort of you know
yeah oh it's comical yeah you can tell her f- yeah tell her Fritz will probably die real soon so she can come to America
okay
and then mom
Anyone
Anyone particular that you are seeing no
Not really you know one day I'll still surprise you guys yet
Maybe
No anyway mom and Henry are coming
um I told you on
Tuesday
for three days
ah that's not on the weekend
No they switched it did it on
mhm
They said they'll come to you and to Abby's
yeah
Actually probably meet Abby's going there we're going to join Abby for dinner on Tuesday but we're not there's a meeting in Bloomfield Abby well actually
uh I'm not sure if Abby wants to go to it , but she is going to it there's
Can't remember his name but an Israeli official is in Bloomfield Township giving a political speech
uhhuh
and I guess they know who he is or know somebody about him so they're going to it
yeah yeah
and
what else
everything else
are you si- you're still working on your novel righ
oh yeah yes but it's so actually I know I keep saying this because I'll be picking up a_lot more this winter once I get everything else done because than I
I spend so much time outside when it's warm I don't want to be inside working
yeah yeah
oh yeah
And y- you don't have any plans yet for coming
No
No I mean
I'd like to settle a definite plan you know things will probably pick up faster if we ever get our fire department contract settled
We'll get like five thousand dollars back pay then I'll have some money to afford to go
uhhuh
0
yeah
I got a I made a copy of it there's a thing called Israel Sky Connection have you heard of the
Israel Sky Connectio
Connection
It's exp- you pay like two thousand bucks for a vacation which includes like
No
It looks like a paramilitary training thing for the public
oh oh oh oh I think I heard something like that
yeah I might mail a copy of the letter to it's kind of pretty interesting it's all through Israel
I think I read about that someplace
Defensive driving firing weapons on the run you know s- repelling off cliffs you know
I I yeah I think someplace I saw an article for that maybe even the Jerusalem report or something like that
You know it's kind_of an intriguing thing yeah
yeah
yeah I thought it was something you'd like
and
No let's see what els
trying to think of what else is going on
m-
I'm sorry I was going to practice my Hebrew I can't do that on the phone because this phone call
we're maybe go- tomorrow we're probably going to be going to the area near Carmel there's an
Having a olive s- olive picking olive s- some sort kind_of an olive festival in a- a bunch of Arab villages there
and a couple of small Jewish villages
Where I guess it's the end of the olive picking time and there's supposed to be tours of these
places where they make the olive oil and it sounds like it could be pretty interesting and maybe some folklore type music and stuff also
yeah that'll be nice I
and we had ordered a car a while back we thought we were going to visit Dave and Zvir this weekend
mhm
but then it fell through because Abe and Dorothy are go- coming there for the weekend
How's is u- Abe doing a letter better or
Well I haven't seen him yet because each time I've tri- like twice I think I've tried to get down there and each time sort of Dorothy kind of well you know and you know
I guess she's hesitant about people coming to visit
mhm
Though Miriam did se- was there saw them for a couple hours she was in Jerusalem
and she said you can see it's not always the same because
sometim- she was talking to him
and he was going over a map and pointing things out to her
Which to her seemed like they were totally off
and a little while later he was talking and all the instructions were fine
mhm
He just speech is a little bit slurred but you can sti- you know you can understand him
Which is better feeling it's probably how it's going to stay the you know I don't way I'm just yo- it's getting better but
yeah
I'm sure he's never going to drive again or anything like that even though they won't admit it yet
said good morning honey and I'm g- I I'm going to hit her , you know
I think maybe I've got a problem here
uhhuh
So
uh I've been trying to
act a little better and I so I I have been acting a little better
No
uhhuh
It's amazing how resentful I am of her when she wants me to do something I was like you know and then I usually do it but
But eh she doesn't really ask for much she really doesn't
And I could certainly be a_lot nicer and still not
break my
back at over anything
mhm
So that's been improving , my p- my attitude has been improving there
And then
this thing with
you know with Jerry he's
it's just it's it's it's
it's over
I mean it's r- it's really over
W-
we can still go out
I'm not looking for anybody else and I'm not looking
to get him out of my life and
I'd still like to see him but
I'd I don't ever want to live with him again , and I I don't ever want to be
involved in his
this
finan- this insanity , this , you know he's just
oh I want to have a house like that and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and /
mhm
I want to have this and I want to buy a new Dodge pickup next year and
da da da da da and all these things he wants to do , the big plans
And yet he r- he refuses to go to work
mhm
he's just
that's
so weird
Just it's just nuts
And one of my friends is
and I was reading this thing I think it was Newman or
Robert Johnson , they talk about the
peur P E U R
The peur , yeah that sounds like it
You said Peter Pan in your letter
peur
yeah well
yeah
um
And one of my friends is into the Jungian thing
She says that that comes from having a
a consuming
mother
mhm
And I guess she was I don't know
She looks
doesn't look
she looks alright but
but that this is just , you know , he's fifty six years old and that's Jerry
So
all at once
in the last day or two
I've
jus- I've just sort of realized I'm ready for some stability
hm
And I thought oh what a concept
i- I haven't really
been in a market for it
up until now
um
and I I wouldn't know
how to go about getting it either
It's just that hey I think I'm ready for it , j- jus-
oh
m-
Interesting
yeah that sort of hit me too when I
I told you about
realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable and I don't enjoy it that much anymore
It's okay but
that's why I think I I'm going to go back to school
You're ready for stability to
yeah , I mean I want to have
a profession that I can use
you know and get a job
and have a practice and
that I would enjoy more
And
you know and I think about marrying Eve and
if I wanted to I could just be a housewife
And f- he's going to make a_lot_of money and everything but
that doesn't make me feel too comfortable
mhm
You know so
you know I want to go back to school and know that I can support myself
I tell you it's nice though
to have a man who would allow you that option
mhm
There are men out there who will not
be happy until you're learning you know you're if they don't if you know if
you know what I'm trying to say
yeah , yeah
um , yeah
So I think that's neat
But yeah I understand what you're saying it's
yeah
You need something for yourself
Right and it's not just a matter of money but having my own life
too
yeah
But one thing I was going to ask you about was
like you were getting all excited about doing
financial planning and learning that
mhm
Have you thought about going to school and doing tha
Well I haven't gotten too far on that , I
took a little three session course at the local you know
m- adult school on financial planning and e- e- a financial planner did the class and
I says how did you get to be that and he says well he took a class
He says basically he says eh there's a whole outfit in Denver where you can take a correspondence course and be one
But he got a
an undergraduate degree in finance
mhm
And I thought hm
well that sounds interesting
I don't know if I want to go that far
but
I'm just pointing in the direction of learning more about money
And I've got a net worth statement now and it's
I'm surp- I'm just is
I'm just surprised to learn that my net worth is increasing every month you know because e- when I count the stuff up that
like there's eight hundred and ten dollars every month
increased equity in the /
huh
the building
Wow
yeah and a few years ago it was only two hundred a month a
and
and there's that
And then I'm you know saving money through my retirement see I don't have any
income at the disposable income much
now but
There's future stuff if thing you know if
mhm
so I can
manage to get the m- equity out of the building without giving it all to
taxes
yeah
that's where that's going to be a big problem
So
I'm just trying to learn about money
uhhuh
And and it's it's not that hard
I still don't know about
price expense ratios and st- some of the stuff just doesn't compute , like
you should buy bonds when interest rates are
coming down
But not always and
You know I don't know why is that And e- you know I've had it explained numerous times but I still don't /
quite get it
But
hm
I will
And you know , it just just life seems to be all about mastery right now just
Learning computers and riding a bicycle and worrying about money and stuff
mhm hm
So
um I e- I feel pretty good
This thing with Jerry m- it was made me upset
I was I guess mostly I was j-
beating myself up over it
Well here's another relationship
But you know , I never did take him seriously as a
marriage partner after the first month or two
And
But
I was comfortable and I enjoyed being with him for the most part
Although the circumstances have changed now
He just
he's standing on a shrinking iceberg talking about his big plans you know
He's probably going to end up living with his mother Like me , but
mhm
you know d- raggedy-assed and
So does he like you say it's over but does he know tha
oh
Have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that you're just going to always be ther
We can go out you know it was
e-
indefinitely as far as I'm concerned
But I have no plans to be with him for the future
I don't have any plans not to be with him either
But
I don't know if he's going to get bummed out by this
mhm
Or he s- said the other day in when he was in a kind_of a crappy mood , he says he wants all or nothing in a relationship
oh
Well that's a strong statement
And if he
if he presses it then I guess I'll have to say it'll be nothing
uh-uh
mm
And I have never been
terribly involved in his financial problems
But
I find I do things that I'm going to try stopping
Like I
I'm afraid of being alone
And so I asked him if he wanted to go to this Aid banquet and I I
told him I'd buy us tickets
You know now really he ought to buy his own damn tickets
mhm
And there's no reason why I should buy it
But I just wanted to make sure he'd go
mhm
So I'm going to stop doing stuff like that
And if he
doesn't want to go then I'll go with somebody else
well that's the thing the thing about being alone
I mean it is hard
It is hard I've been alone a_lot
yeah
And I I kept meeting these men that
I mean I was really wanting to meet somebody and
I kept meeting these men and then
trying them out and then it didn't work out
You know I'd like hope I'd keep hoping
And I got pretty good at ending the r- these things after about three months And I just kept /
mm
meeting people just ending them
And yes it's it's hard it's hard
But like I enjoy being alone too though
yeah I guess
yeah well
It got less scary after a while
yeah well I am going to have to
come to terms with that
Because I have basically had a man in my life for the past past thirty five years
I f f- figure that in July nineteen ninety one I was alone for three weeks
A- and up till I've always had some man around
mhm
And
maybe it's time to give that a look
, yeah because
I don't know I I
I really started to enjoy
not
needing somebody
mhm
And
I felt really good
Not meeting somebod
Not needing somebody
Needing somebody
yeah
yeah
And like e- e- I could just turn my attention to other things
w-
Well some of my friends are telling me that I don't need a man
And I I know that
But on some level I don't
yeah
mm yeah it's a real internal thing
yeah
So anyway
um Jerry is around
And you know like I'm
I was using my mother's recliner here
I'm sitting in it right now
I can't get the damn foot rest
down so I'm probably going to have to call him up to get him to come and
get it down for me if I don't want to break the damn thing
You know stuff like that it's nice to have a it's nice to have a man around
well maybe you could look underneath it and see if you could fix
yeah , I don't know how the hell
Did you loo
I looked
yeah I'm kind of looking at the cheap plastic thing and
hm
yeah , just turn it over But
So it sounds like one of the joints is not working
Well I don't know I just moved it out pretty far
oh
uhhuh
And oh there's a thing on the side
oh hey I just
Well
There's that handle I forgot about
oh
Shit
Now you don't have to call him to fix it
yeah
Now I don't have to call him That's nice
mhm
Except the back is up too hi- too low
Well grandma can fix that
okay
yeah
oh there it's back and
oh I don't know how to fix that
I bet she knows how to do that
So
hm
oh there it goes
Alright Now back in business whew
That's that's always exhilarating when you can do something yourself
yeah , yeah well
Eve and I got into this
big thing because /
0
the house has been a mess and then h-
then , the house has been really a mess and then then he spent like hours putting up these shelves and I I was getting really pissed off because I was doing most of the cleaning
So I I started getting in this argument with him
And he got mad because he's been working on the shelves
And I can't do the shelves
I don't know how to do the shelves
And so we finally agreed that
he would teach me how to do these things
So tell me I mean it was shocking for us and we just heard it
You know the night it happened on the news it was a little blip and Paul and I were watching T V and we just
looked at each other with our mouths open
uhhuh
I'm sure
You know so
well you know what was really it was really kind of weird
um
I mean when I heard he got shot I I wasn't really surprised
mhm
But then when I heard he was dead I was really surprised
yea
You know because I thought okay so if he was shot you know he'll be okay like Reagan when he was shot he was okay
but you know then it was like really not long after I heard that he was shot that I heard that he was dead it was kind of strange
mhm
So it was a very you know it's been a weird few days then we had
a day where everybody could go to the Knesset and and see we weren't going to see anything because it was a closed coffin
But a_lot_of a- about a million people went to the Knesset to walk by the the casket
mhm
And
Did you guys go
Bill went I didn't go he had to go at four in the morning and wait four hours
Bill went
ohmygosh
yeah that was just a bit too much for me
Just to get in line
yeah he had to stand in line almost four hours
jeez
yeah so it was too much for me you_know but
uh yeah then the next day when all the we had like eighty five presidents and kings and queens and
what do you call it foreign ministers and this country and that country who came for the funeral that was really kind of
I guess you'd say moving
yeah it is and there were you know I heard all the speeches god N P R here has just been
Just that's the only story you know
mhm really
all day
hm
I hear Linda about twenty times a day
Really you know it's so funny I've known Linda for like four years and I've never heard her on the radio
yeah
I'll have to go back to the states
oh you'll hear her you'll hear her every day if you come back here
uhhuh
It'll be like
mhm
You never left
How's Melissa doin
hm
oh she's so big
Is sh
She talks
She talks a_lot she says I love you mommy
aw
How are you momm
aw
Is she cute is she still real cute
yeah she's very cute she's well Nissan is going to send you a picture
of course need I as
oh really
We're making Nissan was in the middle of writing you a letter
And then at the end she wanted to send you a picture
So you could see how big Melissa got
oh well I'll have to send you guys a picture of Paul and I
So we have to
together
for for everybody because you
Now when did you get marrie
We got married September first
Well we just went to the courthouse
And we had we got married by a traffic cop
It was really funny
By a traffic co
yeah it was really funny
ohmygod
but hopefully next September we'll have a wedding
uhhuh
mhm
And it was it was sweet it was a beautiful day and he took us outside and under a tree and
hm
It was romantic we went out to dinner
mhm
Did any of your family com
uh-uh
Nobody was there
hm
Nobod
No
Did you want anybody to go
Well eh we did it
We decided to do it that morning we had decided we would get married and we went and got our certificates and all that stuff
But we were both home on that Friday I was home from work and he was too and we said well let's just go get married now and he said okay
mhm
So we did
We were both in our jeans and it was really funny
ohmygod
oh my goodness
oh wow
But it was nice so then
So are you has
Sorry
It's okay
um has he had any trouble with the immigration peopl
No we'd went
And applied for his paper work we went through everything
So we're at our we went through the first step
We have an interview on February
mhm
fourth with the I N S
He got his
mhm
he got his card to work he got his social security card that let's him work
so he has an honest job now
mhm
mhm
And hopefully after that meeting there'll be no problem he'll get his green card or wherea- whatever he needs
Because you know I don't remember who it was that I was telling about it
That you guys were just going to get married you know by a judge or whatever
uhhuh
And the person said that the I N S doesn't go for that
mhm
That they want to see a wedding and a reception and a whole you know thing otherwise they think you're just
yeah
getting married so the person can work or whatever
Right
Well
We've I've thought about that and and I can't imagine
They may have questions because of that
But we have photographs of us in Israel and we have letters we wrote to each other
mhm
mhm
You know which is wha- which is what they require to prove that you actually knew each other before
uhhuh
And we just explain that we don't have we're paying for the wedding and we don't have the money right now
which is true
mhm mhm
So I I really don't foresee much trouble because we have
uhhuh
We do live together and
You know we
mhm
If they interview anybody they they will find out the truth which is that
we got married
and things are going really well he's he's
mhm
He's molding just fine thankyou
you know you h-
Moldin
You know you have to change him a little bit when you marry him
oh
And he's i- it's taking him a little while but he's getting
He's perfect almost
Is he right ther
We
No
I'm at work but he's he it's really great our relationship is working out real well
oh
Good because the last letter I got from you eh it sounded like maybe you needed some more time or
yeah
yeah he moved out and he was on his own for a while
We have the time but
mhm
You know I don't know
mhm
He he's just the one I guess
mhm
yeah you still think so
yeah
Definit- more and more every day you know
Good
Good that's good
It is wonder- how are how are you and Bil
Is Bill right is Bill ther
We're okay you know
yeah
oh
uhhuh
It's okay

um well you know we have our own good moments and our bad moments
Your ups and downs
you know but look we're in a very transitional phase right now because we're going back to the states and
mhm
You're coming back in March
I know
yeah
In March tha-
Well actually we might not arrive in New_York until April first
But that's our last
That's the last date we have two reservations
One gets us into New_York like March twenty third and the other
April first
so that's really soon
Well it's pretty soon yeah I guess you could say
mhm
Well it was June before wasn't i
It was supposed to be July actually the beginning of July and then my sister got engaged
oh
and they're getting married in the beginning of May
so we realized that we couldn't afford to go and come back and go back again
mhm
So we decided we would leave before Melissa turned two which would save us a_lot_of money on airfare
yeah oh that's good
And she turns two in April
In April right
So also I'm in my sister's wedding and she wants me to do all this stuff like to have her show- throw a shower
W- I need like a month you know I need to be there by the month before what do you call it before the wedding before the wedding

Well I want to do it all and law seems to be a good way
Just to go ahead and

That kind of thing
But
I'm not too worried about it I mean I can do I can teach or I can um
work in an office

And so I was really really upset because when I first got here I was really excited about him coming and about people coming and seeing me and blah blah blah
mhm
And I was just like so I was talking to him like David what's going on why do you sound like so s- s- su- such a stranger on the phone you know
uhhuh
and like you know if you're not happy with
our relationship then we have to talk about it and like decide something because I feel like horrible
mhm
So
He
so he like
He's like well
I didn't want to tell you this this happened a little while ago whatever and he's like I cheated on you
ohmygod
And of course like I just couldn't believe it and I was just like wha
Right
It was like totally out of the blue it'd happened like a month ago
ah
And
When you were still in in the United States
In New Jersey
Over the summer the
Yes it was early in
it was when I got home from Shelter Island
And he called like out of total desperation saying like he had to move he's living with some psycho woman
Right right I remember that
yeah and then I didn't hear from him for like a whole week
Right
Which is completely unlike him
yea
So he cheated with me cheated on me right after he got off the phone with me like around that time
With the psycho woman or with wh
No no no no no not with the psycho woman
With this woman like he had been living with three two guys and a g- woman
yea
in his old apartment
yea
And
the woman was one of the guy's boyfrie- girlfriends
Right I remember that
yeah and so he cheated with her
ohmygod
yeah so he told me how like
at that time
when he left
the house he had helped her move into her new place
yeah
And she helped him move out of the house
yeah
and
He said he was feeling really crappy and like I know I had written him a letter saying that like you know I should see other people and blah blah blah
Right
And so he was really upset about everything at that point
And then she like told him
that she really really liked him a_lot and she really you know had feelings for him and
ohgod
And then they had sex and I'm just like well
I was like pretty upset
oh I I'm sure
0
yeah like ah I just really devastated me for like
That is so unexpected it totally devastated me I couldn't believe it I mean I I can't I mean like
yeah
especially to tell you this when you're you know fairly new in such a strange place and
yeah
Probably going through a_lot_of shit anyways
oh yeah when I first got here it was a big party like my
what happened i- the supervisor turned out to be a real
real jerk
Being paid great and
And there's nothing in the apartment when I got here and I
yeah
Everything in here already
And I like just went through major culture shock
Right
So
I don't know lots of things have happened and I
was trying to look on the bright side when I was writing the letter
Right
Because I mean I am happy here like I'm really happy with stuff I've
been dating a_lot since then and like got my life together and
yeah
Cool
And my job is really easy and I'm
You know
hey I've so much to learn here so that's exciting so I'm not bored and I just like
Right
That's cool
Don't sleep enough it gives you all because I'm too excited about everything there is to do and
yeah
This new apartment problem if I could just
Move into a new apartment then I'd be all set
So
oh what ultimately happened with that thing did I mean
oh yeah
it sounded like you stayed together for a while or something
um
yeah we did like okay
Well I was completely and totally just horrified and like
uhhuh
Like crying for a while on the phone
Like I just couldn't belie- I couldn't it was so bad because Moss it was like
I completely
Trusted him
Trusted him like
yep it's like ev-
No no no but like it's so bad because it's like
His like that when he's broke that trust right
Right
He broke it in all people
hm
Like not just in guys
yeah
You know what I mean like for seriously for a week I just hated everybody
yeah
And it was so bad because it was right when I got here
So it was like I didn't want to meet anybody new I couldn't like I was so devastated I was crying like constantly you know
yeah
And it was just like I couldn't trust anybody because
You know if you decide to trust somebody so much
you just comple- completely never think that they could do that to you
Right
Right
And then they do
Right
It's just like
I totally know how that feels
yeah so
I guess they grow up
Like why should you trust anyone
yeah and I guess I grew up a_lot from that too though
Yea-
And I don't mean that in a cynical way because like
I totally believe that you have to keep trusting people now
Like for a while I was really angry but
yeah
Now I'm like you know you just have keep trusting people and
they screw up they're human and things like that might keep happening or whatever but
I don't know if you can I don't know
if I could ever trust anyone and I don't know if you feel if you've ever
Not like that though
Not like that
I don't think I ever will trust anybody like that again
Not like
Not like the number of times I've heard a woman say I know you would never do that I know him
He would never do that I swear you said it I swear I said it I've
oh I said it
Filthy women say it
oh I totally said it
And it happens from now on it's just like
Well you know I trust him I I mean I would I hope
But he could
Who'd never do
something like that but it might happen I I I could never s- see myself ever being that
yeah
naive again
mhm , that's what it is
And I think that's
but
Probably healthier and good but it's also kind of
It is
Bad it's like you lost your innocence or something and why do people have to do that
Yes
to you I mean if you could just live your whole life in this happy love trust
faithful kind of thing imagine the kind of person you would be this young romantic fool passionate and like
just crazy and
mm
Not embittered by the co- coldhearted world
It gets robbed from you though like
yeah
And I mean I don't want to say that we trusted the wrong people because
yeah
I mean I really believe that David is a good person
Right
And like
At first I like when he first told me I was just like David you know I will always love you whatever but I I'm going to go now and you made your decision and
Right
There is nothing else to talk about so
Well I think in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing that
You kno
oh yeah he's totally like unhappy by
what was going on because he basically he wanted to be together
Right
He wanted like he needed a sexual relationship
yeah
And he needed me to be there and he needed to like someone nurturing and all that crap and I just wasn't doing it and I know that
Right
Right
Like I was really hard on him I was always telling him that we weren't like working out I was always saying I didn't want to be with him I mean
And so like
He did me the biggest favor though and that's why like I got over him really quickly it's kind of funny
Reall
Bec- yeah because
like at first it was really devastating
Right
Like it was so weird because the difference between Josh and him like Josh was devastating for a long time for me
Right
Even though he wasn't as nearly
As like I never had as m- many as deep feelings for him
Right
And it never like was as serious in many ways
mhm
But with David it was like I think because I had been in pain for so long with like
yeah
problems with my parents and problems with him and all this pressure
yeah
That by the time he finally cheated on me I just realized
Well at first I didn't because I I had to okay interesting so I told him goodbye and then
he called me again like a day later or two and we talked things over and then he called me again we talked things over and so I decided that I could forgive him
mhm
mm
Right
And we could still be going out because I still loved him and I could understand
How it happened because of the situation
mhm
But I I told him I still thought it was still shitty and horrible and whatever
mhm
but that I could forgive him
but it would take a long time to trust him
God Liz that's so rational of you I can't believe you
No no no but it was though and I really did like forgive him
mhm
It was like you know I thought
about the whole thing and I'm d- and besides many times I had thought about cheating too because I like
I just couldn't understand that part of him really well you know and
At the time when he called me I wasn't there for him and he really needed to talk to me and I sa- I was really cold I was like listen my parents are here I can't talk to you bye
You know
Wow
so
then
I had forgiven him but it still like just hurt it wasn't the same anymore you know
Right
And he's so far away and there are other people here that were interesting to me and
I didn't
Want him to come live with me
mhm
I didn't want it and
And he wanted that
yeah and I had felt a_lot_of pressure and I didn't want to promise him I'd come live with him when I after a year
Right
And so finally we had another conversation a while ago and
And it was actually a while ago it was in September or something in early September and I was just like
yeah
you know we really need to talk and I think it's really over and blah blah blah and he's just like he was less
Like I was more like it's over and he's less like it's okay you know
mhm
But he's like okay
And then
So that was it
We're over and then I hadn't talked to him for weeks and weeks and I had a really bad cold and I was sick and then he called me up again ah
uhhuh
This is the worst that he had dr- been drinking a little bit
yeah
and so he was just like I really miss you I really want to get back together and blah blah blah
yeah
And I was just like no I like you know I he made me start crying though because he started like reminiscing I hate when they do that or whatever
they
yeah so I started crying a bit and I had been sick and like on medicine all week so I
yeah
You know it's just like you're depressed anyway
mhm
And so
And so he's just like let's get you know back together and I want to see you and all this stuff and I'm just like
And then I like at the end of the conversation I got myself together and like no you know
I like where I'm going he's like well where are you going I'm like I don't know but I like that
mhm
And I'm just like you know and
I can't promise to see you again or whatever because then it's just like
you know then wha-
It's all been I can't explain it but you know it just
It's not right because all the pressure feelings started coming back and everything
Right
mhm
So and he's just and I'm like listen you know you never know we might get back together way in the future but I just can't think about that now I want to be free and all this stuff so
Then I just got a letter from him
oh great
and he's like
You know I really miss you still and blah blah blah and he's like by the way this big phone bill can you help me pay it
No way
yeah and
Forget that
Wha
Forget that
Well no no no the thing is though is like I would help him pay it because
yeah
Right
But he said he's glad that he did it because otherwise no one would've ever have known
Well
So
Well I'll say
I'm glad too because you know I was having all that pain and I didn't know why
Right well daddy says hi and to tell you that he wants you to get to feeling better too and he loves you
oh thanks
thankyou
Tell him that I love him too
He loves you too
okay
Well bless your heart well
Well
You don't be up doing nothing , you l-
Well the the doctor said I could do everything just like normal he said that I should be fine he said just be careful because you know he I've got stitches in my belly button
Right
And he said to be careful with that but and he said everything else I could still do
Well you you take easy for a few days anyway
Well I am Toon's helping me
Let Toon baby you
Well I am but Toon just had surgery too so
He di
On wha
They cut out his wisdom teeth
oh they did
And so he's not feeling good either so we're both sick
Toon had his wisdom teeth cut out well bless your heart I wish I was there to take care of you
And so we're both kind of just taking care of each other
Well good
Well
He's been washing the dishes and I picked up the house so was kind of trading off
yeah
So
Well
eh Just
I Let the dishes mound up and let the house work go
That's what Toon said
It'll be alright
Toon said
That's right
And Toon said it'll be okay , honey
Da- grandpa said put that little dishwasher in there to work
I know
we let him doing this this stuff because I don't feel like bending over every time I bend over my stomach hurts
Right
And so everything that I want picked off the ground I go around the house dear and pick this up pick this up
uhhuh
He's like aw mom
But the doctor kept telling me this is a good time he he came out and told Toon while I was recovering he said she's ready for a baby now
Well good
So
Well I'm so glad I guess you
the hospital sucked
Is it ba

And it's got
I mean they've got a_lot_of rooms and everything but they had six people
In my room with me six beds that were almost touching each other and no dividing curtains whatsoever
Really
We had one bathroom one shower and one toilet
oh my lord
Well when you get ready to have your baby you're going to have it here in the states not have it over there
I know Toon said and you want to have a baby here I said shut up
Well
So he he was giving me a hard time because last night I went in and I almost started crying I told Toon I says I don't want to stay here and he's like honey eh just make the best of it it's only one night I said I know
Right
It was eh eh eh was it full of German

That's right
Right and that's good I'm glad you didn't because if anything ever bad happens dad or I will get a hold of you
You will call

And to tell you she was pregnant but

Then we said would mom that looks like it's going to be your last hope and Heather said well you got a little sister she'll get it b- you know pregnant I said
Leslie is not the type to have a baby trust me
Right
Right
And I sat there and I kept telling her over she said she's going to have a baby I said no she's not I said you don't know Doodles

You you just couldn't believe half of it
She changes jobs every two weeks

She's working for a cardiology place now and
And I told her I said you won't be there long I said you'll get fired or something if you call in sick like you did at the other place
Right
You know and
The last job she had she never even went back to
I know she told me
you know
uh
I don't know about her
She doesn't have any long distance on her phone
She can't call
Right
You know
So that all that's all blocked and taken care of thank God
Right
uh I was off today
I was off the last two days
And I was waiting on my , my pin letter to come in and then Stephie I have
I Hoped to talk to you before you went into surgery
uhhuh
And Steph told me she says well Stacey went in yesterday for surgery
yeah
yeah I mean you know she told me that , that
You done had it done by the time I talked to Steph
oh no
No
And uh
So I was waiting till today and then I was going to call you by in the morning if they hadn't of came in today
But that's good though I mean at least this you way you know what happened and
yeah
You know if you would've called before the surgery you wouldn't have known
Right , well that's true
You knows
I was just hoping you was home and what is it about twenty to eleven ther
It's eleven o'clock
Eleve
Well I mean Toon sets his clock fast so it's like ten till
Right
Right well see it's twenty till four here
okay
And
Daddy
I was going to come home on the fifteenth Toon and I talked about it and I said I'm going home on the fifteen and I had wrapped all of you all's gifts because I've got stuff that I was bringing back home to you all
uhhuh
I wrapped it all and and Toon said you're going home I said yeah
And then I talked to my form came in saying that I could have my surgery
It was approved
Right
And I called Doctor Gonte I said Doctor Gonte it came in when do you want to do it and he wanted to do it right after I just got my period so I just got my period November the eighth and I
uhhuh
thought just just eh two days ago
Right
And he was like we're doing it on Friday I was like eh
Doggone it I can't go home then
But I mean that's better anyway because
yeah
You know Christmas I can go ahead and spend here and then January Toon is taking leave and we're going to fly home
Well good you'll all
Even if
You'll all be together and it won't be such a long little flight for you that way
Right and even if
You'll have help with Darrin
Right and even if Toon doesn't get leave I'm still coming home and he said that's fine
okay well good
So , I've already planned it
yeah
But the budget still hasn't passed and they said that if it doesn't pass by December first we won't be getting paid so
You won't be getting paid for wha
for Toon's job because he's the federal government
yeah
But see they had paid us on the fifteenth because our paychecks at first everyone said we wasn't going to get paid
Well by God they better take care of the army boys
But then they said that it'd already been aligned so they paid us on the fifteenth and now they're saying if it doesn't pass in two weeks that we're not going to get paid
oh
So it's going to bite because it's going to be right at Christmas and so it's going to really bite
Right
You know so hopefully they you know d- find out something to do
Well I hope so I tell you Clinton sure got it in a mess
So are you all oka
oh yeah we're doing fine
Daddy has been down in his back bless his heart and
eh
And uh
So you've been working
I been working my right arm is still giving me fits on the bottom side
uhhuh
And I had went back to Livingston he was he set me up to do the surgery and they got ahold of worker's compensation and they would not approve it
Reall
yeah
They said being as I had already went to my attorney's doctor
And got a rating
uhhuh
that they would not approve it
uhhuh
So I switched attorneys
and
I don't know if she'll remember who you are or not so
well s- sh- hopefully she knows you
yeah
R- she knows you that's f-
mm-hm
yeah
and then I mean you can whatever if she's interested she can come over and
you guys or whatever
Right yeah
um
I mean I assume being as already he said he found a place and it sounds like
he's already committed to he said that he's going to move in there so
y-
I don't want to tell him something now and have him
says something different to the people he's gi- giving a commitment to now
Well I mean he's under no obligation if you tell him like well actually this girl bagged
you know
Well it was more I thought that just whether you were comfortable with him
than it was wi- whether whether or not we had somebody to move in but
yeah I mean that was the original issue
right
But I'm I guess what I'm trying to say is that I
You'd be willing to give it a chance
at this point I feel like I don't have any rightful that I kind of used up my
yeah
whatever
yeah
well I hope you don't feel like you were I don't know like ah forced into any you know decisions out of your own ah you know feelings I mean
well I mean I'm not really sure what that means but
Well I mean I hope you weren't you know you know your mind wasn't like made up for you you know
It was in a little bit to a certain extent yeah
because
you know and it's nobody's fault really it's just bad really
abysmal timing
you know
Well yeah
and
I
whatever I mean
I guess you could say shit happens
yeah okay
It does
but I mean
it's really frustrating here because I have no control over it too you know
so it's like
yeah well it makes it equally
and then t-
hard to have any decisions done
to think that whatever that it had been all wrapped up and everything was solved and then to have
you know to get this email from Sarah like oh I'm so happy I'm moving back in there
right she she clearly didn't see that it was important
like you know you had a commitment
show you the place
Well she did though because later she was like oh I'm really sorry I hope I didn't mess things up for you
and that was like well
oh
In fact you did but
I mean
yeah I mean we may not have somebody renting it right away that's
well
I mean
I guess I can ask my parents for money
make up for
well
for it s-
my fault
I I I feel a little a little
tough asking Brian to
split you know during the time
I mean right now he's splitting it while
while you were gone
you know we're splitting it Ming
yeah
I mean I I'm full of like really
like myself
bad feelings about the whole thing I feel like I screwed you guys over by moving in with you
basically
Well I think
because I mean you know these fellowships I'm applying for almost all of them require that I live abroad
you had it pretty much
you know
yeah
and I knew that
I think I was just massively in denial
last summer
yeah we-
but I mean that's something that you and I have to talk about too
yeah
on just
not even on the housing level but on the
yeah obviously on the whole different situation
you know wha- what are we going to do next year if I
go back to France for another year
yeah
right
because I don't know if I could
handle another
I mean
four months is
a pretty long time
bad enough
you know
yeah
I don't know
and what we'd have to
last looked it's kind of going kind of slow
yeah
yeah
you getting a_lot don
um yeah I feel like I've accomplished a fair amount
that's good
and then we'll sort of have to
fall into place in the Spring
Right you have to see just
you know digesting
Right right
I made a really bad mistake not bringing a computer here
if really f-
You can't get on to any computers or
Well I can use Sarah's but I mean obviously she needs to use it too and
the thing is to have a Powerbook or a really small computer you can take to the library with you so that you can take your notes right on to the computer
yeah
sure yeah
It's so much faster
yeah
so you
and like
did you take them long hand and then
yeah
enter them in later
yeah huge waste of time
yeah
well
They didn't have any snow on the ground but boy it was eh
It's cold here
It was cold it was frosty the
but it was like forty four degrees so that
yeah
yeah but it's just that it's just that clear cold that's the way it is been here it's just been cold
real crispy
yeah that's it yeah
yeah this guy up in Paris he's going well I moved up here for snow no snow yet thankyou and I said well just wait it'll come
This way you'll have your share
Well
We're got one year to go
and we're going to try for Germany
If Germany doesn't happen we're going to try for Beal
Possibly Nollis Peterson
which is in Colorado
ooh Colorado would be neat
Nicord which in Washington
oh that would be neat
and then
If none of those pan out then we're going to have like Right Paddle High Oaks because it's a nice base
ooh that would be cool
yeah so
we may go over to the other side
oh Colorado you'd love it you like to ski
yeah right Pat's pretty nice too man they got ninety acres of hunting land ei- out on the base
Where where's that at
It's in Ohio so that's quite a ways there
ooh that would be neat I've never been there
yeah but I'd be below Maverick's sister
so she'd be able to go visit her a_lot
yeah yeah she could go visit them quite often
well
Well that would be cool
but we're going to try for all the you know yeah that'll be like the sixth choice we'll go down well probably else fourth
yeah
yeah
I should get Germany though but if neither way we'll be coming home
Well I watched that movie
Only You last night
yeah
and the- they were over in Italy and that was looking real exciting to me and I was going oh look
tell Roy okay Roy that's where I'm going next
yeah that's it
Guess what movie we watched tonight and it does look like
that place we were at
Wha
Rob Roy
yeah we watched it tonight
eh di- did you think he was dumb or was that just my perception
I don't know he he could've saved a whole lot of frigging problems if he just called that guy a whatchamacallit but then again
O- or well if he just went over to that high lord and said so and so wants me to call you this and
and now he's after me because I won't
yeah there there he should've done that he did tha- he should've done that
But yeah
But because to trust that that first lord that guy was uh was
He's too back stabbing he might of called that guy a mega whatever
But
oh or whatever the heck you're supposed to call him and that guy might o-
Jacabout Jacobite
Yes
yeah Jacobite and then they got him on the turn around and got him anyway and then he we have nobody to turn to
So I can understand why he didn't do that
but yeah
He should of went over to the first lord instead of the getting his wife raped and his friends murdered and his house burnt down
pretty goddamn stupid
yeah he should've went over there and talked to him well at least after he got his damn house burned his wife he could've save his friends by gosh and went over there and talked to him
yeah you know when he saw things were going down I mean like telling he's like oh don't worry about it their fight isn't with you bologna
With their dog either look what happened to him
I know well it's really sad
So but you know on his grave it didn't show another baby so that baby must not
yeah
that must've been something they wrote into the movie
yeah because what well I don't know I don't remember there was two sons right
yeah they had two sons and they didn't show any other baby
yeah so that's weird
So
So u- unless since it
I remember
wasn't his error but it still should have been buried around her some place
oh maybe who knows what happened to it maybe it got kicked out or whatever that's another movie there
yeah I don't know what happened to it maybe it maybe the with all the stress and everything she di-
she didn't have it
maybe she miscarried or something so
yeah could've been
what when he's he was talking that smack to him and you just knew ooh
oh yeah
oh when he chomped over and bit him in the neck I was like yeah
Alright
I would've done something man I was like whoa
that's terrible
yeah
that that guy was messed up he sure played being a doofus good though didn't he that little short shit
yeah he did
that he acted li- I was wondering about him and
He acted like a queer
yeah I was wondering about him in real life
because he certainly acts the part
yeah
proun- putting around there the first time when that guy got real mad at him because he
yeah
pronouncing around bowing to everybody and he just wanted to do a little
yeah that's it
so
Well I think Rob Roy was acting really
Well I don't know he got cut up pretty bad but I think he knew he couldn't beat him unless he acted l- really got the guy overconfident
yeah so
Because he was showing his ribs hurting and everything
Well and he was hurting pretty darn bad you know he was taking a good beating
he got the shit knocked out of him
so
yeah
I'm real glad you picked that dude hu
Guess who's still surviving
hu
Guess who's still surviving
Grandpa Fred
Well I hope so , but the bird
oh
Yes she's still hanging on she can't breathe we're going to chan- change her name to huffer and puffer but
stupid bird
yeah she flies a little ways and it's like you can see clear down her throat because she can't she's gasping for air but she
All kinds of telephone calls
Of course none of them were Garret
mhm ha
I'm fine I mean I'm just getting more and more as I would answer the phone and it would not be Garret , I would
oh hi you know
oh
and poor Staff Sergeant Ingram was the last one who called
and I said oh hi and then I said oh I'm so sorry I just you know
uhhuh
I just was really hoping it would be Garret and it's not and
mhm
And
he's when I told him Memphis Tennessee he said oh good
mhm
he'd sigh
uhhuh
So I guess you know I didn't think about Bosnia or anything awful like that so I guess
yeah well that's what I thought of
I'm like
and also what I didn't know was that Garrett wanted to be in the infantry and he didn't get to be so yeah
mhm
yeah
I'm glad he didn't get what he wanted
mm
So he's w- and sergeant Ingram supposed that since he's going to Memphis that that means he'll be working on
air ele- some kind of electronics parts to airplanes
Electronic parts to airplane
oh
uhhuh
uhhuh oh
So that will be nice
mhm
I guess I mean you know it's something that he'll still be able to do when he gets out
uhhuh yeah
Not like learning how to oil oil tank
things Really that's what Lawrence and one of his friends that's what he did when he was in the service
because he just you know the eh the
you know how the tops of the tanks have those kind of ball bearing things
mhm
He just made sure that those ran right
uhhuh and yeah and that kind of /
puts him out of business once you get out in the civilian field
yeah so aren- there isn't so much of a call for ball bearing tank ball bearing
uhhuh So
um lubricators
uh So do you have an address for hi
No
Not ye
He's not gone yet
He's graduating on Wednesday and then he's going to Margaret's
for the weekend
mhm
and then went until Sunday and then on Sunday he's flying to Memphis
uhhuh
um
oh okay he he graduates on Wednesda
mhm
and then he'll be at Margaret's for Thanksgivin
Or will he be on base for Thanksgiving
I think he'll be at Margaret's
That will be nice
uhhuh yeah
oh I think I'm going to go up to
mom and dad's which I don't kno- I feel mean that I did-
Wh
well because dad is always hinting that he but I just I don't want to make a great big dinner and all that stuff
uhhuh
that's it that's really I don't know
I just don't feel like it
mhm
But
Well if it's just the three four of you that wouldn't you know
yeah
Now this has really been a good a week an-
last eh let me see it started out with the coffee pot and it went on_the_fritz
and there was no way to fix it so they bought a new one
then the vacuum cleaner
was acting crazy and Lou fixed it
and then my stove was going to make cornbread yet
Your stove
ooh
and I opened it okay I had it preheating and I opened it up and there was this great big white ball inside and I go
Lou my stove is on fire
So he came out and he threw some salt on it and it kept
just this white ball of fire
I mean it didn't have any flames or anything it was just white ball
and we finally shut it off
And today Mary and I went to Spokane and got a new element for it
and I brought it home and we stuck it in and
turned it on and it went Boop
oh no
So I guess that when we had the big ball of white fire it did something with the switch
and I don't know if we blew the new element in the bottom or not
oh darn
and Thanksgiving is only two days away
Well you'll have to eat at Mary's
oh well I I told her that
Have you already invited a whole ton of people over , I suppos
no she she's going to bring the pies
mhm
But she said that you know she could bake the the turkey there , but I haven't told her that our new element isn't working yet
oh
oh
so we'll see
hm
oh brother
I put some high octane car- ah gas in Simon and he seems to be running with more exuberance so
and he's not saying fu- funny things like you're right rear door is
No
Right rear passenger door is ajar
yeah
No
it except that the the breaks sound kind of So it seems like everything is falling apart
Darn wel-
so okay did you get your boo
Yes I did
thankyou and I wro- I started writing you a letter in Spanish
In Spanis
oh you dirty rotten rat
Don't you do that to me
I can't read Spanish
mhm
Well I mean just so- some
Not the whole letter in Spanish
oh okay
Just some of it and then I misplaced the letter so
uhhuh
But there's a whole bunch of other
mhm
Well now it's it's Thanksgiving vacation so all I have to worry about is just wo- you know just my eight hours of work and I
mhm
and I've been going right home after work
Well , actually , I haven't been
I've gotten re-addicted to this horrible game called Tetris
Which is oh it's this kind of geometric shapes
They fit together
uhhuh
And so I
goodness Friday I wasted an hour and a half
I stayed after work for an hour and a half playing it and today I
stayed after work for an for half an hour
uhhuh
Just playing that stupid game
I can't believe it
I've just I'm going to ask
if they can please take it off of the computer because I just
think about it all the time
hm
I i-
what did is it actually a waste of time or
oh yes definitely
It's not helping anything or anybody
Unless I don't know
I might be able to fool myself into thinking that it would
help me out with spatial relationships
or something but I don't think it really does
oh
hm
It would be just like saying that playing Super Mario Brothers sharpens your reflexes
Well yeah
You know
uh well I'm surprised that you didn't think about
Garrett's being state side you know I
had visions of oh going half way across the country like Emily
oh I don't
da-
see I just don't
I think I just want too much Ike wanted him
ah he when he called the last time he said
So , I might get to go to Fort Louis or e- or Mountain Home
or mom even Fairchild
I thought oh
oh
Because that's what I was
I was counting on Fairchild
That's what you were hoping
yeah
oh
So
To me Memphis seems like a long ways away
Well
Have you heard from Em since she went bac
yeah
She sent me a a letter that said dear Mom
thankyou so much for everything love Emily uh
And that was it
oh
Which was nice
I mean it's more than I've sent her
uhhuh
But still it kind of was
yeah
see I just want too much
No No yo- you know yo- she could have said you know that
um she had a good flight over and she met some new
friends or she could have made it a little bit y
longer than that
yeah
But you did get a letter from her so
yeah and I mean you have a nice long letter if I could if I if
if I could ever locate it
uhhuh
Well I can't eh I can't really believe this good fortune that you you know
yeah that's but a half an hou- hour
That's a long time
um a half an hou- a half an hou-
Isn't it
like but I've been but I've been worrying to myself thinking
well I'm not really worrying I've been trying to think of some way to scam thinking
well now I could call back and say I was Constance and then I'll call back and say I'm Madeline that was so
uhhuh
ah
No way
You can call anywhere in the world though so I was thinking about calling Emily but then I wasn't sure what if that was her right number or not and
mhm
This time I wanted to talk to you
oh well
oh My mom
But that would have been nice if you could have talked talked to Em
Well maybe mm well what's dad going to do for Thanksgiving no
mm I don't know
He'll he'll probably go to one of his church friends
uhhuh
yeah
till Lou says we're going to McDonald's
Going to take your turkey with you and ask them if they'll cook i
Lou says he doesn't go to McDonald's
No he I remember that he used to he used to really hate it but it seems to me that he had recapitulated somewhere
well w- we
But we don't eat at Burger King or we don't
Levi wanted to go somewhere one day and we were at Fred and Annette's and so Lou said we'll put it in the car
so we strapped him on in and y
dealing with it I think he just
realized a_lot_of things I guess
right
either that or he just never expressed it I mean you know Scott
oh
yeah he's pretty
quiet about that kind of thing tell him to make some mashed potatoes for me
and eat some for me
ah
I will
already he's like
I just talking about him the other day I was like when I was in Japan there was this
friend of mine who every time I went to his house I asked him to make mashed potatoes and he always
did
everyone was like
okay and waffles
that sounds good
They're like you have a waffle iron in Japan yeah amazing wasn't it
oh well I have to tell you that Reve
has taken your place
as far as wha
in terms of looking searching of
being pathetic
searching for a mate
oh dear
yes and David
well let me tell you it doesn't get better when it gets back here
God I went out on this date and had the biggest flop ever have I talked to you since then
it was so pathetic and we had nothing in common nothing it was like oh well
No you haven't
yeah you wrote to me about him
he had asked about three times I was like well I guess I'll go and
it was like he works at the school and
uhhuh
you know and like he
was born there grew up there worked there didn't go anywhere
um
nice guy
we have zero in common
oh gee
So I and I'm thinking okay what can we talk about for all this time so we drive twenty minutes to go to like an Applebees you know Applebees
uhhuh
out East coast scene
so we go to Applebees and then we e- we eat dinner and then there's a forty five minute wait
before this movie we went to see and then there's a twenty minute drive back so that's just way too much talking time because we had nothing to say
oh gee
and I was like
so
anyway
So
I mean there's only so much how much can you talk about like you're talking about okay yeah you know the first time I got drunk I threw up
for
a week you were going oh yeah that's cool you know okay we just got through all that let's see
first time I was in a car accident you know I'm trying to think of common denominators among people so
oh gee that's
and then I kind of ran out and I ran into him on campus the other day I was looking for him
I was going t- I was going to buy a bunch of C D's when I got home except for the small fact that I'm
broke so
so
he l- he's been lending me C D's and I asked him one day if he had the T L C one because I wa- I wanted to copy the rest of it
because you know I didn't bother to buy it because I had half of it that you gave me right
uhhuh
yeah
so he's like no so suddenly like three days later he comes up to me I bought the T L C C D right
was like
oh
oh no
so he lends it to me I still have it
oh shit
I hope he likes it that's all I have to say
oh jeez
and he says to me what's he say to me
He was like oh
yeah you know we'll have to go out again when you get back I was like yeah how about that anyway I I I you know I'll give you a call
and unfortunately I see him on campus all the time and he's a nice guy just nah no no not interested
oh
oh
you know
oh jeez
you've been there we've all been there
yeah
How are things with you and Jon you still a little
couply thing
yep
yeah
Are you like official do people know no
yes it's official people know
yeah yeah people know
yeah it's a official people know yeah
So
I got a
I got a
email from Ari the other day
oh yeah I just get a letter from her
She writes her letters exactly the way she talks
I know did she draw the sideways smily face for yo
No
oh okay you watch in her letter she'll she'll make if did she type i
She she her letter
that's about it
oh man that's excellent
I didn't get the sideways smily face I just got the
Did sh- did
Did she type i
No she wrote it
okay that's why when she types it sometimes she'll make like
she goes to make these smily faces but you can't do it on the typewriter so she'll put a colon
and then half of a parenthesis
as the smily face
oh
oh jeez
I used to get these fax this summer and then if it's not a happy face like she'll she'll use a
a back slash
instead of the of the of the curve
parentheses
she's so funny
sounds like
So anyway she's still working at the Coach Factory Outlet
when when you wrote to me and said she was working at the Coach Factory Outlet
mhm
thinking
she's making bags
she's on an industrial line making bags
that's what I thought she was doing she's selling in the store- that's what I thought she was doing though when she explained it to me
ohgod I was like in which I got her letter I was like oh phewsh
that eh
oh that was
yeah
that's what well she didn't make it very clear when she was talking to me she was telling me she was working at the
at the Coach Factory Outlet but ho- I for some reason didn't clue into outlet y- ev- though she said it
f- she's working for a coach she said or something I thought okay
ah
ye-
yeah I just got the coach factory
when you wrote to me you just wrote coach factory
When I wrote that's because I didn't know
because I thought
yeah oh no
hu
huh you ther
hell
okay
oh yeah I'm here
so
oh
yeah poor thing so she has no money
I am so broke I just I just closed out my savings account today and I can pay for tuition but I can't pay to live
yeah I know
so I still haven't gotten my pension money
I'm bitter
You still haven'
No they sent it back to me and I sent it back again because my passport is not clearly stamped
Isn't that nice
So I had one of the Japanese guys a good friend of mine Masal
He wrote a
letter to go with it and I sent it back and started the process over again in the beginning of October
so I don't expect to hear until the end of December in the mean time I don't have that like five thousand dollars that I really need
to function in my life
oh jeez
So now I got to go and beg for more money from financial aid
see if they'll give it to me
oh jeez
pain in my butt actually
yeah
but whatever
oh what a pai-
wh- wh- what can you say tonight the X Files are on so I'm going to watch them
this is my life I never watch T V up at school the only thing I watch is Friends
that's the only T V show I watch
oh you don't watch E
I no it's too depressing
I can't watch that right before I go to sleep it's like
oh I love that show
I should've known better I should've known better
You know me
I'm the one who had dreams about like Anne Rice books you know
oh jeez
yeah now David's successor her parents send in to her to like every month like a bunch of them like four or five hours of it
So like Reve and I always like go over and watch them with her and
yeah and
One night we went over
and just stayed until four in the morning watching them
that's okay I we don't have a T V in my dorm
okay there's only one on campus so like you have to like schedule it really into your day and I only watch
oh
Friends because that and that's because lots of people watch it and I know it will be on
otherwise you have to reserve the T V room and I can't be bothered to do that
hm
oh
so my friend Larry I went to homecoming a while ago my friend I and my friend Larry had a
a video tape of Star Trek and I was like yay Star Trek right so
I'm up at school and he recorded the F nine for me and sent it to me
oh
What a doll I was like yay he didn't have a job he could sit home and do this stuff you know
but
He tells me he's now actively he's been unemployed for like two years he's he's
You have a V C R to watch tha
oh no
folks have some money so he's not dying but
it's so funny because he's like well now I'm actively looking for a job a- as opposed to passively I guess looking for a job
as in if someone knocks on the door and says come work for me I'll I'll go but
oh
oh shit
but now he has a resume too anyway
ohgod
Why are my friends such losers I don't know
oh shit
but everything is good
0
ohgod
going to Steve's for New Year's
gee
oh you are
okay
yeah it's his birthday on the first
yeah so anything going to happen
so
oh I don't know it's just one of those relationships which not
going anywhere and it's not even not going anywhere it's not even standing still it's not really existing it just
0
0
happens
yeah when we get together it's fine but
0
it's kind of ran- like I called him I called him and Jim
I see if they're going to be around
uhhuh
for Thanksgiving because I was going I had tomorrow off
right
and I for a while I was going to go visit him
David I talked to David but I'll tell you that in a minute
uhhuh
Anyway so
okay
what am I talking about okay Steve
yeah so I I say hey you know I'm going to be I'm gon-
think about coming down to the city after Thank- eh Thanksgiving and they're like
oh
oh we're going to go home for Thanksgiving I was like alright because they live about
thirty minutes from New_York City you think they could make it there no
I was like what are doing they were going probably nothing but I'm just going to stay home
Like oh for Christ's sake come and see me no no wouldn't want to do that now would we
oh
God throw a wrench into my life so now I'm going out to Hershey Park tomorrow
oh shit
or my my friend lives in Harrisburg and she wants to go to like Hershey Park
Hersh-
isn't that the one that was
they have
hu
that just moved
that's the one that just moved
yes shit yeah my friend just moved there and the thing is
It's Hershey Park I don't know Christmas light
special or something so we're all going out and then we're going bar hopping
I'm so excited a bar I haven't been to be a bar in a long time
bar what's that
oh okay
they ha- they have a mission over here I call it
and they're
three sisters from their order that we live with two of us another American and myself
and of the three sisters one is another American
and then the other two are native Taiwanese people
oh alright
so at this point
My other two companions speak much better Chinese than I do one will be finishing next May
the other is just a gifted person and
you know just picks up real well so you know like s-
And how long has she been here
tha- the one that's gifted
p-
I mean picks up well
she re- she
she started when I did and last March
she had studied for two months
oh
in the states
and then this summer sh-
before
oh
uh she went back and studied again and the way they studied they concentrate on
speaking and vocabulary so she's done extremely well
wow my
but she's she's also about thirty five years old
oh but you know
a- and a teacher
oh okay but there is something about
you know you have it or you don't
you know
I think that's true
th- th- it's a gift because my niece Suzy
you know she had learned German in high school
mhm
and then she got a scholarship to Germany
so her first year of college was in Germany
mhm
and then when she came back
mhm
um she continued at
U W Madison
and while she was there she meets a guy from
mhm
Holland
hm
well they're married now
you know
but they went together for a couple of years you know while he was here and then his time was up and he he went back and then he came here and
and within
I would say about a half a year or something like that maybe a year
then she took Dutch
you know
mhm my gosh
and speaks that very fluently
and I thought well gee I didn't get that
you know so she knows German and and Dutch ah
a- and it just flows she just flows
you know
yeah I think there's some relationship
between German and Dutch you know I think if you learn German
I I just have a feeling you can probably pick up Dutch
with I had asked her about that but there's
uh
N
ye- to some extent but then you have to know which is which
oh I see
I- you know maybe maybe lamp lamp in one and lamp in the other
uhhuh
you know I think
uhhuh
e- she said there were some words like that
but it is if you want to say like a different language
yeah yeah
hm
I mean you know
Well now tell me ho-
yeah o-
ho- ho- how's your mother
Because I just I just wrote you a Christmas card Lucille and I put it in the mail
oh you did
alright
yeah
yeah
So how's your mother doing
good
good
um
uhhuh
I you know tried to get home
last it was a month
you know and I'll
I'm going to run home tomorrow morning and take her to mass
mhm
and then bring her over to my sister's
because I I don't know if I'll get home before Christmas
mhm
you know again
mhm
but I try to
you know get there yeah
but I can see
um you know she i-
each time I go home I feel like she's slowing down more
you know not being able to do all the things that she used to do
and now with the Winter you know it's a little harder
mhm
mhm
Today is a beautiful day
but
on Tuesday
we had the biggest snowstorm of the season
oh you're kidding
oh it was something else
oh how much
uh
how many feet
eh some places went up to twelve feet twelve inches
ohmygosh
up to a foot yeah
yeah
oh
and it started in the morning l- like when I went to work it was raining
and you know they said it would turn to snow
uhhuh
and it just kept up and it turned into sleet
you know
and by afternoon it
uhhuh
was no later in the morning
the snowflakes were just coming and windy
it was windy
oh
And
oh
thundering and lightning and the snow is blowing
it was an unusual
I forgot what do they call it
some kind_of a
snowstorm I guess they called it
but it
yeah when you have lightning that's unusual
yes now I didn't see any of the lightning
directly
but I did you know how out of the corner of your eye
you know you can
uhhuh
you can sense
you know it all lit up
I saw in in the snow
uhhuh
hm
Now I did hear on the
I think the T V news
uh
you know one of the weather guys saying you know how he
he actually saw it and it was fantastic
It had to be because it would come through the snowflakes you know
mm
mhm
well then
it was our power kept going off because the snow was so heavy
and so I I think it was maybe you know pulling the lines down or so
Sure I bet it was
and then
yeah and this is you know I work at Saint Catherine's and that's
you know near the lake
it takes me twenty minutes to work
it's a good twenty minutes you know when I drive
mhm
okay so the power kept
going on and off and then the sister said
uh they had to wait until that power really came on
um but they told me they said you better go home
you know and this was shortly after two thirty oka
mhm
so I
you know got myself all bundled up went out and it wasn't uh freezing
you know cold but it was
mhm
bitter cold because of that wind the wind was so strong
mhm
i- it wa-
yeah the wind chill I bet
mm yeah maybe
So
I asked
you know everybody in the lobby you know before leaving
um you know some of the sisters some of the workers some of the residents I said
what's the best
to do take the freeway
or and take the city streets
the city streets
don't take the freeway
you know and so I thought okay you know because that's you know
high rise you know and I thought
mhm
So
I started out ohmygosh
I got
mm
I was just I'm in
you know where I work it's right downtown
After an hour I'm still downtown
mhm
mhm
mm
and cars are
struggling in it was a nightmare a nightmare
because they
were they able to get out like and salt the streets or not
no
they couldn't keep up with the snow no
No it came too fast
yeah
and
oh
and it was just and you could see everybody was trying to get
get out from their work
So we were just jammed
sure
it took me
yeah
t- until ten to five to get home
uh
so there was li-
how do you ho-
how do you usually go Lucille do you come in on you know
I take
like ninety four or
yeah I do take ninety four for a while
you know there is a a section that I take
uhhuh
and
uhhuh
So I I am on the freeway for a while
but
mhm
I didn't you know take the freeway but then I heard other people who took the freeway it was just as bad
and some people it took them four hours and some even five
mhm
hm
oh so then I didn't feel so bad
you know that I was the only one
yeah
you know that
yeah
everybody everybody did and the wind was so strong when the
even
in town I mean in Milwaukee
uh you know with your buildings around going down a s-
you know into section or or so and the the car just rocked
I mean with the wind all of a sudden there would be like a squall
mhm
mhm
mhm
yeah
hm
So
Now changing topics have you talked to Mary at all or
oh
y- yes
Father Larry or
yes
uhhuh
um
I wanted to tell you that one too
I still have time
I
okay
oh thi- this other sister said they'll tell me when it's time
yeah they'll tell me it's one minute left
okay
oh okay
Because I but I want to just kind of
You know after our reunion in the Summer
uhhuh
and I think it was
Larry or Mary I don't know that said you know what about us getting together some time
and so we said well let's set a date you know so
uhhuh
uh I guess
you know after they went home and that and you know checked on the calendar calendar
the last weekend in October we went down to Larry's
place
ah
How nice
yeah and Mary left earlier you know she went
she left on Friday and I was going to go Friday after work and I thought
uh when I was younger I would've done that
you know and I thought no way am I am going to drive into Chicago
um you know when it's dark and
mhm
you know and in with that rush
you know so I thought I'll just leave early Saturday morning which I did
mhm
mhm
and got down there around nine
and then we they said it there was a monsignor who had died
and Larry was having that funeral o- on Monday
hm
mhm
and so he had some preparations to do
this was
mhm
uh
you know a very eh
oh I know the monsignor was his uncle from his
what mom's side
oh his his mother's side yeah
yeah yeah
because I heard her talk about him
yeah and he was it seemed like a very
prominent person
you know so he
uhhuh
right we caught the Fox network will you put it on my table will you put it on my table
we caught the Fox network one hour
condensed version
okay
They ha- they have a condensed version they
oh is that ever nice
they cut out commercials yeah you better not unplug that thing you'll be in megatrouble
I ha- b- the phone is I left the portable phone upstairs last night so the battery ran out
okay
So I have I have the phone from the living room in the bedroom with a s- cord stretched across so I can lay on the bed of course
yeah
so that's why Lee almost tripped over the phone
oh it's only the second quarter
I thought it was the fourth quarter
yeah see that's what I'm watching too the second quarter
oh bummer
It's the second quarter here
So anyway the Packers the Packers have the Packers played yet
But
yes
this weekend okay don't tell me anything more
yeah
okay
but I might be able to follow that
that game sometimes they replay it
sometimes they replay the whole thing
so you get to watch all three hours sometimes Fox replays a one hour
highlight and it's so weird because the first time
we watched the one hour thing
It was like alright you know so y- you get all set up and everything like that a- all of a sudden it's like
wait a minute second quarter you know and
That would be great
yeah what they do is you know all those long boring plays
yeah
you know like when they go but you know those are kind_of fun to see too but
yeah
I mean it's better than better than seeing no game at all but I'd rather see the whole three hours
oh really
oh for sure
Well I was there today
oh that right it's Sunday night
yeah
oh it's at Lambeau then
yeah it was at Lambeau
Well I know I know we won because you said who did we beat and Isaid today you little brat who did we play
Cincinnati
oh
Is it a good game
yeah it was the second half was good
oh the
So if y-
if you are are covered for time
then don't bother watching the first half hour just watch your second half hour
so the second half is exciting hu
right
yeah it was good wa- wa- wasn't exciting wasn't an exciting game but
Lori taped
It got better
Lorit taped the
uh was it the Packer Viking no not the Packer Viking I think it was the Packer Bear game
uh
W- yeah with the Packer Bear game Lori taped it
that was awesome
and
that was aws- I mean it goes right down to the last
two seconds Lori was
yep
I was there
Lori
Lori taped it one night she was exhausted and fell right asleep and so I told her to put the tape in I I couldn't stay up you know I was too tired it would've gone until like two in the morning
yeah
So so I just didn't
I just didn't watch it either so the next night
Lori was I think she fell asleep or something and I watched the whole game and I could hardly
keep myself quiet
I know
the next ye- the next day Lori said
well you know how was the gam
and I just looked down to the floor and I said it's good you got to watch it and don't ask me anything else
and so then she watched it the next night I had a meeting to go to I didn't get home until one in the morning
So
I I came home and she was just finished watching it she said how did you keep quiet while you were watching that I said
oh it was so hard I said did I give it away when I
when I you know when I told you and she said no but you_know you made me want to watch it you know
I and I said are you sure I didn't give it away and she said no I can't believe this the thing goes back to the last two seconds you know because
at first you know you figure there's fifteen seconds they got go all the way down the field you know this is not even going to be close and then they start making it and you go
My gosh they're going to get down there you know
yep yep
that was a good one
We I I got tickets from a parent
uhhuh
for that game a parent called me up and gave me tickets to that game
Wow what a sweetheart somebody is nice
yeah and then he called me up the following week and he wanted me to go to or it was last week's game
against Tampa Bay and I
oh
Now do you go with this guy or does he give you the tickets
No he gave me the tickets
uhhuh uhhuh
I went with a teacher friend of mine
oh
so
I am so disappointed that
that I mean I'm not disappointed at all I can't use that word I take it back
uh it's so bizarre that you would call me
because I just wrote you a one page letter
yeah
oh no
because I knew I because I knew dad was going to call
yeah
so I just wrote you this whole one page letter and now I feel like I've already told you everything
so anyway here are the things that I told you in the letter
no you can't tell me
your house
no your house is beautiful
Did you get our picture
yes we got the pictures the day before we got the film
good
oh good
we got the we got the video
oh oh good
so we ge- so we so we get the pictures
and my my closest Phillipino friend happened to be here
His wife is the one who lived with us the first year we were in Buthwan
mhm
and I'm going through these pictures actually I opened them up at the post office this is funny I opened them at the post office as a matter of fact we got the pictures the day we got the film
so I'm in the when you get a package at the post office you have to go to this different room and then they look for the package for you anyway so I was in the package
I was in the post office room and this other guy was going to get the package and I get the pictures and this the people are so nosy here
shit I probably get like raped and killed and drawn in cord they're probably going to sell me into white slavery on the way you_know they do that in Morocco
oh yeah but it's I mean it's i- I mean people I've been to Columbia before I went to Columbia I'm like they're going to skin me alive and it was this really civil place and I've been to Morocco actually I was in Casablanca
it has a very modern airport and
you know it depends what you're looking for if you're looking for the casbah and like hashish bars you'll find it but
you know
I mean I suppose I could travel there by myself
Well we should meet down there just think how wild that would be be so cool
Well it'd be wild why do you have to go to Morocco you_know they they like they they rape women there they they they we're like you know
oh and they don't in Brooklyn I heard some guy just
just gassed some dude working at a McDonald's and and lit him on fire in Brooklyn
yeah that's the news from over here that we got over here
oh really
you guys are getting all the good news I don't know I'm a total like social political pinhead I haven't read the newspaper in a month
I broke up with my boyfriend I have an excuse I'm tired of reading the fucking newspaper I don't want to know that President Clinton is sending troops to Bosnia and that we're going to lose the lives of like you_know
many young American men and all those going but they're all black and Hispanic who cares sure let's go
no it's true
while you're getting massages from young Hispanic men
Brazilian excuse me hot oh shit man I I swear to god I'm just going I'm jumping him in the broom closet
You've never done a Brazilian have you
No
Well I'll tell you honey
what do you think are they ho
It's a paradigm shift
It's a paradigm shift
I am such a dirty old woman I don't want to I don't want to sleep with any of these eligible bachelors that I've been going out with I've been going out with some eligible guys but they're all like just so geeky they're old they're not interesting you know but this guy is like
exotic
why don't you start going to
I'm sick I have a disease
you should skrank him and then
you should see you hang out in these re- yuppie crowds you should like call up
yeah
call up Mike Michael ask ask him to invite you out to like some art openings meet some groovy guys you know what I mean
go to Nick's next opening you know what I mean
I'm sure his girlfriend will like it when he starts inviting me places
oh who fucking cares about his girlfriend she pisses me off
she's got like a stick up her butt or something
Nobody I know likes her including me
that woman pisses me off
yeah she's not one of my favorite people she like she took Michael's spirit away or something
I know man he was like we were close before she moved in
He was fun fun fun
before she moved in
and then yeah like what happened
I resent the hell out of her I admit it
I resent the hell out of that woman
yeah
but anyway it doesn't matter
So you think I won't be like drawn and quartered raped and sold into white slavery on the way to Ca- Casablanca
No what are you talking about
How would I get there from Madrid like just train how much is it going to cost
okay for one
uh
You should fl- Casablanca is a big airport big international air-
oh I should fly ther
yeah well you can get see they have cheap
What you need to do is look into Moroccan Airlines they they have really cheap charters
uhhuh
to to Madrid but they stop in Casablanca
so I bet it y- it would be even cheaper
if you got just straight to Casablanca
yeah but
I was planning on staying until like January the twelfth
Well that's fine so then you just co-
so I don't want to fly out of Casablanca
or you could
you know you could make it round trip to Madrid
but instead like try to
just get off in Casablanca first
yeah
what what are how are you getting to Casablanca
um
well we're actually meeting in Marakesh
but they're flying into Casablanca and then going to Marakesh
but I'm going to take
I guess maybe I'll go cheap as I can like a bus down to Moniga
which is
because I'll travel back to Madrid with you
yeah we'll just take a bus back up but like overnight
Now when do you go back to work
Work is kind of sporadic one starts
uhhuh
on the
third on the like fourth
uhhuh
but then there's a weekend and the next one starts
next time it starts on the sixth on the Monday
after that
so basically the sixth
uhhuh
I think wait let me check my little book here
uh
December this is all free for you right
Wha
this phone call
yeah yeah
oh that's cool
this is all fucking free man we're talking for free
okay so wait
oh bud man I miss you I miss you so much I can't tell you
oh girl get your bony ass over here and we'll like party
Well I am going to get my
my ass is bonier too like I've lost weight and everything
You're have the most
you know because I- I'm like I'm like a dog in heat I'm going like
I mean we lose we lose
I can't I can't do anything about it
So
I mean I don't know how they take it
I don't know
I I don't know
I don't know
It's k- it's kind of hard
for me to even
try to
see if they're disappointed or not
mhm
uh
yeah
I don't even get disappointed as much as I used to
Because I can't take this serious because this league is is is sort of like a joke league
Ridiculous
That's like division three
I told you about that time I watched a division three game
that's right
nah
It was the funniest thing I ever saw
This is a joke league
The more I stay in it the more I dislike it
mm
But
don't know
Then I wonder
It would probably be a bigger joke if you wasn't there
For your team that is
oh I don't know
I mean
it's just not like
it's not organized it's it's not orga- well organized
It's not
mhm
I don't know
You can't really take it serious
Like I said
Have you contacted your agen
have I
yeah I talked to him
He's looking for stuff now for you
nah
I mean I to- I mean I'm I'm go- I'm going to stay
You're staying here for next season
No
oh
That's what I meant
No
mm
Have I ever said I was staying here t- for next seaso
No
That's wh- but that's what I meant
It's like , is he
keeping his
ears open or whateve
I don't the thing is it's like
e-
His ears can be open , but there are not , there are not any like jobs until the summer
yeah
So , I mean , I probably won't be back here
So , I'll probably be somewhere else
I'm saying but
You're right
But I'm just saying like usually teams by now should know what they need
You kno
Why would you know what you nee
I mean if they're like lacking in one area , you know what I mean ,
and they have like a set team right now , then they might know what they're looking for next season
Well the thing is eh eh players juggle around so much
I'm talking about even like the native
players they they switch teams so much
So you really
you can't say that until you know who a- I mean what native players are going to be on your team
mhm
okay
So , I mean , this isn't like the N B A where you you got guys who
there are definite guys coming back
mm
So , I mean , I m- people don't put out
the teams don't put out any orders until the summer time
That's when
they trying to get everything together
Rochelle asked me for your address
She's going to write you
man bitch get ahead What she wan
Because I don't kn- oh I don't know
oh because I was telling her
I forget what I was telling her
But something I was telling her
about
you being over there
I can't remember
But she was just like oh
oh she was starting t- oh she said she was starting to feel bad or whatever that she had
Why she feeling ba
I don't know
So she said that she
Tell her don't feel bad for me
Not for you
She was feeling bad that she hadn't like
kept in touch with you , or whatever
aw
She think I expected her t
I mean we wasn't like
buddies
I know
But she still was
I mean you know what I'm saying
The point is , I gave her your address /
alright
and she's supposed to write you
But the thing is you might not even be there to get her letter because
I asked her yesterday
if she write you
She said no I got finals
And I'm like /
It don't mat- I mean it's like
ain't finals the next few week
So like I guess she talking
Is sh- is she going home for Christma
I don't know
So I guess she talking about like January
I don't think she's going home for Christmas
oh
What's she doin
she going to stay ther
mhm
Wh
She crazy
She acting crazy
oh her gr- her grandmother's still living with her righ
Her grandmothe

But she said something about she got to do all these interviews and
she don't want to go home because that's the
time that she could go to New_York , or whatever ,
and go to these cities and like stay so she could do these interviews
oh
okay
mm
So
But
oh
Me
I'll be home
yeah
You know , until /
Until
the time comes
Until school starts righ
ah hee hee
m-
so

if I want
What do you want for the plane
between
Like little video games and stuff

Because I'll never use it again
uh
what do you want for the plane
So she asked me what was we going to do
Do I need to take some ga- does she need to buy some games for me to take over there
Tell her
And I said
I said why , why do I need
why do we need games
According to you we just going to be doing it all the time
I said according to you we just going to be doing it
And she was like I know
But yall can't do it all the time
uh
Your Mom is crazy man
So she was like do you want some games , does he have any games
Tell her we don't need no games
Tell her we going to do some
some
what do they call those things

mm
and you will be doing that
oh
Some adrenaline , uh , drills
Get our adrenaline up
Would you ever bungee jum
Maybe
But I doubt it
Only if there was a
, yeah , I can't I can't say like I'll I never will
yeah
I can't say I never will
But , somebody would have to push me
I know that
Because I definitely couldn't just jump
Why no
And I would need to do it at one of the places that had the real big pillow underneath you
A real big pillow
You never seen it at West Beach
They have like this bungee jumping area
You don't go up that high or whatever
But underneath there's like this huge huge like balloon pillowish type thing /
No
I haven't been there
in case you f- /
I haven't heard of that
in case you fall or whatever
mm and haven't done any research on bungee jumping either
I haven't but I just saw it because it's like right out in the open
mm
So anyway
I use to think I wanted to go skydiving
mhm
okay
Interesting facts
We're going into those , hu
You know I I used to
um
yeah
yeah , I used to want to be a astronaut ,
you know
But
Did I no I didn't want to be an astronaut
mm
I used to think I might have wa- I might want to be a chef
oh
oh we know you can't do that now
uh
If I went to school I could
It's a little late
I've tasted your food
Shut up
eh
I wouldn't want
I wouldn't hire you in my restaurant
But if I went to a school they could teach me
okay
Some things can't be taught
But see I never like
cooked or whatever
I always do something that just requires
me to pour some sauce on something
well
I don't ever
cook
okay , okay , okay
I don't want to go into my cooking
I don't want to go into it
Your cooking , your your cooking
your cooking represents you
I don't want to go into my cooking
your cooking
What , what are you sayin
I
The effort you put into your cooking represents you
It does not
That's what I'm telling you
So all people do is put sauce on me
ha ha
No I'm saying
that if you don't put much effort in your cooking /
then that
that means that you probably never will
Shut up
It wasn't like you had anything to do
It wasn't like
You know , you didn't have any like
uh duties or /
But it's uh , I mean
jobs or anything
okay
cooking has never been like my hugest priority
I'm sorry
Yo- your hugest priority
My most biggest
Your most biggest
What's your huge
hugest priority , as you call i
um
I don't know
Me
You
I'm saying what is your hugest priorit
Schoolwork
No
See it should be schoolwork
But it kind_of ain't schoolwork
then what is i
I don't know
I don't I really do- I guess it's schoolwork
okay
Schoolwork
mm
We'll go for that one
I'll take schoolwork for a hundred
yeah
No
I I gave the answer
I said what is your biggest priority
See
And and you got to add the
the uh , you know ,
the statement part of it
No the statement comes first and then the question
I kno- well
But I asked the questions , I mean I I I gave the answer first , righ
So therefore you got to you got to eh
a-
eh fill in the facts
Whatever
It's the reverse of you know Jeopardy the
oh , okay
The reverse
Did you talk to your momm
You understand what I'm saying
uh , no
She wasn't home
So , I left a message
I had to
put some onions under my nose so I can
and close to my eyes so I can get some tears rolling
So so I can start sa- sounding like I was sad
So
Did she call you bac
No
I don't know
My mom I I the thing is I don't know
how often my mom checks
checks her , uh , answering machine
Because /
That's true
Because I remember over the summer you said she didn't check
because when when I
when when I was home
I did all the checking
She never checked
Like once a week or something
mm
But I mean I don't expect , I didn't tell her like to call me back or nothing
I just told them when I was coming home And and
when I expected them to pick me up at the airport
The twenty second , righ
No maam
Aren't you leaving on the twenty secon
No maam
On the twenty thir
Yes maam
Exactly
You're just bright
That's the problem
it was very stressful when it snowed
yeah
so anyways , but
no
but so Jacob is sound asleep
yeah
Rachel is Rachel is crawling around the kitchen and Doug's making pumpkin cookies
oh boy
and I'm making spaghetti sauce
oh boy , aren't we just the happy family yeah Sarah's on the floor here
playing with the phone cord , hopefully she doesn't pull the phone off
down now is is Rachel running around yet , or
she's pulling herself up
yeah
and that type of thing , and she can crawl wherever she wants and her latest
thing is that she gets up we have blankets on our , we have a fire place so
right
you know the the brick area
yeah
she gets up there , with
it's all covered with blankets , and then she pulls herself up on the , the
I don't know what you call it , the fireplace guard thing
and she stands up there and she kind of bounces her knees and she laughs
because she thinks she's doing something really cool but that's about the extent
of her , you know
well how old is she now she's
ten months
she's okay , she's a month older then
just a month older , so she's probably doing the same thing your daughter is doing
yeah , yeah , Sarah's yeah , crawling around anywhere she wants and
yup
pulling up and standing up and she has let off a couple times
and stood still and then she laughed
yup
thinks it's hilarious
like when I go somewhere and I put her down to take off her coat , she doesn't want to sit down , so she just stands there
uhhuh
till she falls
oh
but , don't you
do you find that she she
duck
understanding everything you say basically
I
I mean
think she does , and when it her name is being spoken , she like turns and
yeah
yeah
looks and
Sarah knows no
there's
I don't know if Rachel knows no she doesn't like to act like she does
well she looks at you and then laughs
like
you don't have to do this
yep
so
yeah there , it's a really , I think it's a pretty funny
yeah she , it and Jacob just loves her
these are all
Tom yes , yes , it certainly is
it's either , it's a love hate relationship
so
because it's so precious
Sarah , I love you and then the next minute it's like Sarah Sarah , I told you no
it's mine
yes
so
well my kids are just a little bit older , so
it's like mom , she's in my things , or
yeah
Carl , I don't know what you did with your library book look by the couch
I'm on the phone
ow
we went out
today we
where did you go
we went up the street
they have , there's a like a little strip of
stores now that have opened
one is a barber shop , one is a
african shop that's got stuff in it , and then another one is a thrift shop
unhunh
so I went to the thrift shop
and
Jacob needed some new mittens , so I got a pair of gloves for him
one of those Fischer price radios you know
yup
and something else he found , some it's a toy , well anyway
all for two dollars
alright
yeah
that is a deal I got , we had
I got the fisher price tape recorder one the kids , you know the older kids were
small , at this place called building nineteen , four fifty still works , we still have it
uhhuh well this one I want to get for Jacob I think for christmas
uhhuh
because he loves mechanical stuff
yeah
and I mean he's playing with my stereo here that we had in college you know
yeah
and he's he he just plays with it
mhm
you know , and has broken it but
it still works
oh well
but , if he could have his own , then I could say , you know , that's yours you you play with that one then
yup , yup
so I think I might look for one like that
, well that sounds good
so yeah
yeah , we
Carl , Carl wants a baseball mitt , he says for , for christmas , we were at
Toys_R_Us or something and he says he wants a baseball mitt , and so then then we get back in the car
we're driving home , and he goes mom , you won't believe our backyard this summer , we're going to make , I'm going to make a baseball field , I'm going to make bleachers ,
I'm going to get
bleachers
I'm going to get hats , and I'm going to get pants , and I am going to sell them
so then he's telling me all the things that he's going to sell and I'm like Carl , are you going to play baseball or are you going to sell
he's in ,
he's in the management
I'm like
he didn't come from a long line of salesmen did he
so I'm not so convinced that he'd he rather would sell than he wouldn't play but
well he , there you go , he'll he'll organize he'll be in the the union and whatever , and manage everybody
oh yeah , so
so he'll get all the neighbor kids there to play , and he'll sell tickets , yeah
that's exactly what he's , he already has , one time he filled up
his wagon , I can't tell you the junk that he had , and he went through the neighborhood , came back with four fifty
I'm like , Carl ,
you got to , and how old is he
he's six
this is the summer so he was still five
oh great I just spilled lemonade all over my face
there's like a mouthful left I'll drink it
now it's all over my shirt
ooh
my corduroy shirt
ooh is it new
yuck
yeah
ooh
oh well it has to be washed now
I haven't done laundry for like three weeks I really have to do laundry before I go home
oh gross
this isn't
what I have like
no not you me I have I'm covered in lemonade
oh
oh yeah more than you thought
yeah
I don't usually drink from the carton so maybe I
oh okay I thought you meant the cup and I'm like it's kind of hard to misestimate a cup
so whatever
well it's gone now
and Paul it's Paul Newman lemonade
oh
oh yum that's even a really good kind
there is the best orange juice out here I had it couple days ago
I have never had like such great orange juice do you have Adwallah do we have Adwallah at home
I've never heard of it
it is so good it's like
better than fresh lemonade it
I don't know what they do it's but it's just wonderful
so
unfortunately it's really expensive and we don't get it here here we have concentrate everything
except for milk which I can't drink so
I would give anything for like a premixed drink most of the time
and I'm just covered in
stickiness
oh poor baby
oh well
how is Sarah doing
how's Sarah doing
oh good
I have no idea what she's doing right now but she has a clipboard
oh
and soon she'll realize that I'm talking about her
but she hasn't realized it yet oh she looked
I do that with Emily I can go on for like forever without her even noticing and then other times I can be like
oh yeah yeah she's okay
and she'll be like what
yeah we got our phone bills today mine was like six dollars and fifty cents
how did that happen
I I just I called home
I called some number three three six three six three zero
I have no idea what it is
I don't know
three six three zero I'm trying to
that sounds like a store number or something
oh wait I know what it is it's blockbuster video
oh well there you go
yeah my doctor is is not in that's what she's talking about
am I good or what
oh yeah that's what I called
now I know I'm like
are you working there over the winter
yeah
oh blockbuster oh I'm so tired
I really really really don't want to work
well maybe you won't find a job
I know it's kind of what I'm hoping for
do you really really need one
kind of but
I figure I'll just get a job next semester
yeah
which is what I said about this semester but I think I really will next semester
so
I really don't I don't know I could work in the factory
for like a week
mhm
and I mean that would be cool to like pay off christmas bills and all that but
I don't know I just don't want to
will they hire you
yeah probably
and so it was like so did you work there last year last christmas
yeah
oh okay then
will you see Milton if you go back
probably I mean I assume he's he's still working there and all
yeah
actually I wrote a christmas card to him
oh
so
I don't know I don't know what to expect with that but
I gave my japanese presentation today
oh yeah how did it go
you know what I'm talking about right the one about you
yeah
it went well except there's this one I wrote I emailed you I think but there's this one part where I talked about how you your hair was so much blonder
and that you look like Tori spelling and it's really really funny and I completely blanked out I don't know I just went
I went oh my god I completely forgot the entire essay
then I had to skip over it and just go on to the rest it was only like two sentences though
oh no
mhm
but I just completely blanked I'm like what
oh god oh well so I couldn't just stand there like
you know so I just went on with the rest but
and then everyone because I then I talked about you and Milton and it was like
what did you say
it was like because well it's really simple japanese
yeah
well I sort of had to describe like whatever and I was like
then Sarah met Milton
and Milton was from Venezuela and he liked the salsa too
and then
but Milton didn't speak english very well
he spoke spanish
Sarah spoke a little spanish and everyone just started laughing so I guess they understood
so that was good that they understood at least because it was really simple but
it was just funny
and then like
and I was like but Sarah was happy
I did not understand any of it and then
and then the last is like well now Sarah is in California and Milton does not write and Sarah does not write
but Sarah is okay
she's taking spanish and she's doing very well
so funny
okay
the other people that gave I couldn't understand a word they said my friend Kai
yeah a little bit she helped me with my computer
uhhuh
that's so I didn't have to cart it
oh that was the main thing
yeah that was the main thing because if I would of had to
the other stuff I had to put into huge garbage bags basically most of it was in garbage bags
mhm
mhm
I just threw everything in the garbage bag and
and put them on this big like rent a cart it's like from the unit office and then I
uhhuh
uhhuh
I had to wheel it all the way to Theta which took so long
mhm
and up a hill it was so exhausting
oh boy it was
and so if I would've had to have my
computers on the cart it would not have been good because I could've like
uhhuh
well they could've
gone over a bump and they could've fallen off
they
they could've fallen off definitely it's not good to have computers bumped around
so they
right so may basically drove me
oh that's great
and
yeah and she helped me carry them in
so how many trips did you have to make back and forth
oh altogether three
uhhuh I bet you were tired
oh I'm still tired I haven't like
mhm
I'm really tired my room is not even completely what
moving moving is hard
moving is hard
yeah and and no one really helped me other than that I mean
like Mira and Josh just sat there necking when I was in the middle of packing
oh great
they're just so lame I'm so glad I'm leaving them
oh it's not very fun to be around somebody who's
they just they're so weird mom it's like they're not normal people
like how
long story
well tell me we got time
but
oh good point okay well it's like
Mira doesn't really care that much about other people it's like
she seems to be nice but it's like she
I don't it's really hard to describe
but
she's kind of superficially nice but she's not really thoughtful and
she well it's not that she's mean in anyway she's not it's just almost like she's nice and it's just so blase about things she doesn't care at all
considerate
mhm
about anything like about how people feel
and oh for example
this is one thing
one thing that's been really on my nerves lately I don't know if I told you about this was that
Josh basically is like living in the room the only thing he doesn't do in here is sleep and then doesn't matter because when I'm sleeping I don't
mhm
care if he's in there or not
uhhuh
you know what I mean
uhhuh
but he doesn't sleep in here but he spends all of his time in here basically
mhm
so
so you don't have any privacy at all
no I have none and I have to ask him to leave if I want to change
mhm
and or go somewhere else to change
uhhuh
which is pretty ridiculous
so this
yeah so the thing is
basically
what a frustrating thing so basically
Josh like likes to play this game called mech warrior
mhm
which is this really stupid video game and it's on Mira's computer
mhm
mhm
and him and all the other guys on the on the floor like love playing this game
uhhuh
so they all crowd
oh they all come in and do it
right and they all and they do it at the stupidest times
they do it at two o'clock in the morning
that is really inconsiderate
actually that's the latest they've done it sometimes it's to twelve sometimes it's to one
mhm
mhm
but it it it's like final week and they they were doing it at one o'clock in the morning
mhm
uhhuh
I had a final the next day
well
you know that's really really inconsiderate and I'll
and it was
I'll tell you the truth that's one of the reasons that
I don't like coed dorms and it's not that I have anything against
you know guys and girls being on the same floor
but I think that it's so much more unruly
and
you know all of these things that you're experiencing
I just think
I don't think it enhances the experience I think it really
you know makes it a more stressful
well guess what
tiresome experience
I'm not going to be in coed dorm anymore am I
I know
it's going to be a single sex dorm
I know
it's in one way
you know what
did I mean
did you have some pleasurable experiences at the dorm
sure I had a couple
a couple
some random pleasurable experiences
did you make some people some friends with people that you'd like to maintain
yeah
yeah
a few
like one girl I tried to get a get to join Theta her name is summer I don't know if I told you about her
uhhuh
yeah you did
but yeah she's really sweet
uhhuh
and
I like her a lot
well be sure to keep in touch with her when you move
yeah I have her number and everything
mhm
so
yeah she's
I mean it's not like you're far you can come and visit her
no it's five minutes walk so it's not a big problem but it's just like
uhhuh
and she can you
you know you can have her come visit you
honestly though I really don't think I like any of the people here enough to really want to maintain a friendship with them which is really a a really a shame
it is
considering I mean I made friends with joy so quickly and
mhm
and I've been here a whole semester and there's no one I'm really close to
mhm
and I've tried
mhm
people are just aren't willing it's really strange
well
you know sometimes you mix with a group and sometimes you just don't but I
I guess
but you know look at how
but Theta is I mean I've I've made more friends with with people in Theta than I have
well that's my point obviously you know you and Theta chose each other because you have a lot in common
you know dear
yeah
and you know that's what's so nice about it it is you feel kind of simpatico with them
and
you know there's there's a a meshing there's a chemistry
right I really like them
mhm
I mean
not all of them are friendly but it's you know it's a huge house
oh of course
so yeah it's really cool
so I think that aren't you glad that you made the decision to change
mom I really am
I really especially for the last several weeks have been really miserable here
mhm
really
well I'm sorry you've been so miserable but boy it sure reinforces your decision doesn't it
yeah seriously
mhm
so I'm really glad you guys convinced me to move
um , not until after mid January
Or
Actually , a break I think not until after February
Well
Because I've
we've got assembly and chapter , and then I have another retreat
And I st- I have to prepare I have to write that
paper yet /
mhm
for the fifth phase
I did the research now but /
uhhuh
I haven't been able to write it yet
So
I I they have I need to have done
by the
second week in February
yeah
oh
So
okay
Then we have our meeting down
uh south
So
And after that
I think I have a little bit of time
So
But actually I'm not I don't feel
so tired like I did
oh good
okay
So
Because you were sounding like you did
A little bit
yeah , it did
When I first got back I really was tired
I'd be
I was
I believe it
I was exhausted /
yeah
actually
But
I I
I can't imagine why
No
No I eat right
right
I understood why
But
it so it took me a little bit
to get
time to get back
mm
yeah
get settled but
Now I I feel
like I've
I'm in in the groove
And
Good
And now it's it's
I I think kind of working with the unknown also
That's part of what I
oh
I know
Probably is is in the hopper for me too
mhm
And th- that will probably not be
defined this year the first part of this year
So
Probably not
oh
yeah right aw
right I talked to your mom on Sunday
ah great
How are the
um
I think okay
She was a little breathless , so I don't know what I got her from
But the kids were there
Because Colleen and Tim had a party
So I don't kn-
ah
oh they were baking cookies
That's what they were doing
ah
Anyway sh-
I think they're fine
And
I told her I was going to call
So she was concerned if you got her letter that /
said your dad's tests had all turned out alright
Yes
It's it was here when I arrived
So
okay
Yes
I did get that
okay
yeah
Did you get the last letter I wrot
It should have come just these days or else it will come yet
No
okay
yeah
yeah
I I put a list of where I'll be up through February , in in there
oh okay
yeah
okay
I wasn't sure wh- there's been a threat of of mail strike here
So I I wasn't
really sure things were going through
So
oh
okay
no
I decided to send it anyway bu-
yeah
After your fax , I didn't even expect one
I didn't look for one
yeah I I've I
thought you probably wouldn't
But I
I jus- I had a little bit of time and
so I decided to write
mhm
Well good
yeah
I didn't
That's alright
oh
That's alright
yeah
This is this is eh eh a good exchange
e- yeah I thought so
Right
so you're having a very heavy winter , hu
Well we are
um , we just missed a storm last night
It went south
oh
So we
We missed
a potentially a heavy snow
I guess
They tell us we still could get some light snow
But
oh
Yes
And then it warms up
And now there are bare patches in the
snow
And in th- the grass is showing
oh rea-
o-
But we had ice on top of snow
oh
That's yucky
yeah
So we've got areas that
still look like
well Cathy was here over the weekend
She said it looks like tundra
And something
In some of the places
and it warmed back up to the /
yeah
twenties and thirties
So
ah
But yeah , it
I eh- w- potentially in for a good one
I think
yeah
Well it sounds like it I was it's even been on television here
You know some of the
mm
The snowstorms and the cold weather
The- there have been some cold /
yeah
yeah
they have too
yeah
yeah
So
But
d- did I write to you about my trip back from Chicag
Well you just wrote that , you got stuck in the in the street
On the way back , hu
o- oh
um
Well we were all stuck in the street /
oh
one time or another
But I didn't get stuck till I was out here
oh
okay
I- in front of the house
It just took four hours to get back from Gene's
ah
From Loyola University
Well was it snowing the whole way bac
No
It was raining in Chicago when I left
oh
uhhuh
And they had s- /
uhhuh
they had said it would not
h- the snow wouldn't hit
southern Wisconsin until later in the afternoon
So I
I was
aware of that
mhm
But I was hardly across the border when I hit snow
oy
And from there on it was
Slow going , hu
Slow going because it had rained before that so that had
turned kind of icy underneath
oh we- that's I I hate that kind of driving
yeah
But the trucks were very careful
Which was , /
uhhuh
w- was my salvation
That's I get nervous when they go flying by
yeah right
But they kept their distance and went slow
uhhuh
Anyway
Well they must have been nervous too
yeah they were
yeah
So
yeah
Anyway it
I mean it's not
I don't mind snow so much
It just would have been more fun if somebody had been with me
I was by myself
I know , it's kind of you think , oy if I end up in the ditch area , I'm al- all alone
you know
yeah
Right
So
And I had to give up my Toyota
And
Did you
I did I had to give it
You've been pretty lucky , actually
I know
ah
I had to kiss it goodbye
oh
So what d- what do you have no
I have a thing called the Pontiac Sunfire
oh
It's
I think it's a new
Is it big
It's a new model of something
Anyhow , it's very nice
It's also a /
uhhuh
a compact car
It's al- hea- it's a heavier car than the /
oh that is good
uhhuh
Toyota
But
uhhuh
it's it's very nice
That was kind_of a /
joke around the place
hints
say goodbye to my car
oh yeah
oh Well , you've been unusually fortunate
I know
Yesterday we had eh the team had lunch with the other team
uhhuh
And they
Joe is such a card
yeah
So he com- he comes into the
we were at Heinemann's he comes in with
a- a trivia game that we should all play
uhhuh
And then he pulls
something out of his
out of an envelope
Anyway
He they gave each of us
a gift certificate for a manicure
You're kidding
no
oh
That's too much a
For the ultimate in pampering
oh
I would have preferred uh a massage
Well I've never had manicure so I'll have to see because a real manicure
I think involves a massage of the fingers and
and hands
uhhuh
So
I wanted to say what about my feet
oh
No actually I was so taken back I didn't know I hardly knew how to respond
I I can imagine
oh
Right
The second
Of
of
A second edition of the
uh a giant newsletter arrived here
eh i- wa- was here when I got back
So
mhm
oh
Good
I hadn't seen it yet
yeah
Well it it wasn't there very long then
I mean
uhhuh
It just came
oh it just came
oh
yeah
yeah I guess it does come first class mail
I think it does
yeah
I looked at eh not that I
in talking I I realized that I saw that on th-
envelope
yeah
On the outside
yeah
But uh , that's right I appreciated your reflection
Very nice
oh
thankyou
About
Your
wife
oh
We did our video too
Did yo
Well I thou- I yeah
That's what I was coming back from Chicago
That's what you were doing in Chicago , hu
yeah
yeah
yeah
How did that turn ou
It turned out okay
yeah I mean I I would /
Did i
it would give me courage to do something like that again
oh
Good
The
e-
the
people who are doing the video
a- I don't think are professional professionals
So
He just put the camera on all three of us and left it there
uhhuh
uhhuh
um
And , because of that
there's a glare on my glasses all the time
oh
yeah
Which , of course , I don't like
And I know that
from doing the video with the the
recruitment video for the Salvatorians
when Carl Leclaire did it /
uhhuh
those /
guys made me tip my glasses down a certain way
And then they angled their cameras so that they didn't get a glare
oh
yeah
yeah
So I know it can be done
yeah
But
Anyway
uhhuh
We're
it's circulating throughout the province
We made seven copies and sent them around
So
How long was it e- did you make i
It's between , I think forty five and fifty minutes
oh
uhhuh
But e-
I I think we did an okay job
I mean you can't do everything in that amount of time
oh I'd like to see it
yeah
Carolyn , can you believe sister Yosha die
yeah
I know it
That was a real shock
yeah
She had liver cancer
b- Gene told me
yeah
That's what Lucia wrote when Gene and monsignor were were uh gone she wrote a fax for us and said /
mm
that
well right after you know Shosha died
And and
explained that she had liver and I guess it had invaded the stomach also
Stomach
yeah
yeah
i-
Instead of being built in the wall they'd be free standing
yeah , but you'd have to fasten them some way to the wall
uh , well , maybe , yeah
You'd have to fasten them
They could just be they could just be tied to the wall
That would be a no big deal
Maybe
Maybe not
yeah
Maybe not
yeah
Whatever i-
we c- yeah I I agree and Leona does to
We talked about it
And I said to Bonnie mention it
And I said yes , that's right , we can't let that stuff sit there
Although the basement is nice and dry
But it's just not
oh I know it's d- I know it's dry and everything it's
yeah
yeah
it's not the it's not the condition of the
items , it's the fact that kids are down there /
No
unsupervised
yeah
And I can't believe
it's only going to be a matter of time before they start /
Yes
yeah
filtering through those things
I would have to agree that that
is a possibility
I haven't seen it happen because I we do go down there
when they're there
But yes , they could be crawling in that stuff and
coming up with something that would be
Well it I I I feel so incredibly guilty even asking
No
But
No I I think
You know I mean
Th- maybe maybe we could do something different
Maybe we could actually partition somehow
and enclose it as opposed to trying to , because if we put it on shelves
they're still going to be able to get at it John , you_know
I know , but I think if they're on shelves with a curtain they would be less likely to start
Well
Well , you'd be surp-
I I don't know
A partition sounds , whatever's cheapest
We just
We just had
Whatever's cheapest and you think is best
We just
We just witnessed Steffie and Stacey down there who were told not to go in the bedroom
They got in the bedroom and found Christmas present under the bed
mm-hm
mm
I said y- when you tell them not to go in the bedroom , what the hell are they going to d
They're going to go in the bedroom
mm-hm
It's only natural when they're alone
mm-hm
That's you know we were told to not look in there , there must be something really good there
yeah
uh , so , I
yeah
Well , anyway , we'll we'll see what we can do about that
It's
It's just that , you know , some of the things are really
Some of the things are really
You know
I- it might look like junk to somebody else but it has value to us
Yes
I appreciate that
That's what I to- that's what I told Larry
I I s- told Larry , I said , you don't know what /
And and by e-
yeah
why something is important to them
It's not important to you , but you don't know why , so yeah , there's no intent to do anything but /
yeah
but protect it so it doesn't get
Well , and if Larry feels that way , how much more , you know , all the cousins when they're down there /
/
You know especially , you know , some of the younger ones
yeah
You know they don't know
yeah
E- e- I mean Claire is five years old and she goes up to my office looking for scratch paper sometimes
That's right
mm-hm
You know , and and and they just kids have absolutely no idea what
yeah
value something can have So
yeah
That's right
okay
okay , well
You know
Th- it's it's been noted and we'll take care of it
We'll take care of it some way
Well I I feel really a- and also note that I feel incredibly guilty having to ask you to do that
Because
No
I don't know why you should
I know you're doing a
Well yeah but I I think you're right
I think there is
oh
and Leona and I talked about that very thing , that there's reason enough to be concerned
eh to put it in some kind_of a condition so that
nobody disturbs it
And even though , you know , somebody might think it's uh /
mm
not worth a hell of a_lot , that's none of our affair because /
yeah
to you guys
yeah
uh
hey we're con- we're con- we're confused about you guys' address
o-
Is it one three two four or one three
okay
yeah
It's one
One three two four
Excuse me
One
It's one three two four
three
t-
And is Meadow
yeah and that's
Is Meadow two words or one wor
Yes
It's two words and there's an l n besides
It's Lane
Meadow Lane
But it don't make a difference I guess , but yes
I see you last letter just came
So there so there
so there is no Meadow Street
No , there is not
That's right
okay
But so Lane is important but I mean not yet because there's no Meadow Street , but /
That's right
There might be
some day in the future you never know there could be
okay
So it is one three two four
yeah
That's right
O-
yup
yup
And what did you sa
You noticed that my last letter , wha
That you addressed it Meadow
instead of Meadow Lane
But that's not a /
oh
concern
Right right Now did that last letter have /
because
a bill
and /
Yes
an and and
also an envelope to the s-
to the ban
Yes
And that was interesting
I have it in front of me
I went to the bank with this
And he said I don't know why you brought that here , because that's a receipt
that John has for a check
that stop
that was stop-
payment
Right
But
N-
E- he said
They , it said on that
that
It said on that thing that I got that if I don't mail that back
in so many days /
then they won't indeed stop the payment
oh
So you got to mail it to Nations_Bank
No no no no
Nations_Bank is a Visa payment
okay
that
a c- separate entity altogether The /
Alright
Bank Onedojabe /
yeah
is
is something that
I thought I took care of the stop payment over the phone
This is
Then /
okay
about a month later
then about a month later
I get this thing in the mail that says if you don't mail this back in a certain amount of days
we won't stop the payment
To Bank One
So then I had
No to
To Bank One
and and Eileen told her mother and her mother said I don't want to hear it
yeah
oh
oh
n- don't tell me that
aw aw
oh really oh
So
yeah
So she decided to go before her
Well I guess so and that's what the nuns were saying that uh Nellie was waiting for something so
aw aw
my heaven
my
but i-
isn't that something
yeah it really was so
aw
but she had di-
she have eh did Nellie did both of them have beautiful funerals

very

you know c- uh
type of funeral
and
yes uhhuh
she has you know like twenty three grandchildren and she has so many great grandchildren
Sure yeah

and the priest and it was kind of sudden you know
uhhuh
but

oh i- it was so hard and her mother was in such
oh sure

mhm mm
Eileen went in there and and heard some noise and evidently she was already gone
hm
ah but
my good-
um
oh
the
Well thank God it didn't go on for her because
oh it could've gone on and do you know it
could've gotten terrible yes
in fact when Nellie was dying in in the nurs- in when Nellie was dying I thought to myself
oh poor Aunt Maudie when she's dying the suffering she's going to have to go through
yeah yeah
yeah uhhuh uhhuh
but they had uh the sisters of the little sisters
they have a beautiful statue that they bring in

we had everybody get really dressed up
uhhuh

It was so fun
oh how fun
oh neat so so how did th- did they have a place for the kids
that's neat
t-
Not really you know what he just rebuilt his parents' house
because he bought it from them
oh wow
so you just you know it's like an empty basement so they could go down run around that kind of thing
yep
so it was fun
oh good
so you know what your party was it all couples or was there some kids or
it was mixed it was half and half girls and boys but most we had about
four or five couples
oh
and there was a couple single people but
oh yeah
um there was an even girl boy
yeah oh good
yeah so it was nice and they all
somewhat knew each other most of them were from church
yeah
and see they have a really big youth group we didn't invite everyone just a couple people
yeah
from church and then
one of Leith's friends from high school and a couple that are from England
that are friends of his mom and dad's that we
oh
No so just you know
yeah
all different people but it was fun
oh how cool
We had a good time
that's neat
yeah
It's fun having parties
I know it was really fun it's expensive though
we
I know
I don't know how I thought the whole time I was thinking about you like
the party you put on for our wedding and I'm going ohmygosh how do they afford these parties even Christmas Eve I bet it's expensive
oh but like Brenda had dinner tonight
really
by the time she bought the shrimp and all she bought all these special
little things
yeah I'm like man that must have cost her a mint
It was really good
so who who's she having is she having
wait a minute are you there Christmas Eve I what time when what day is it
um it's the day before Christmas Eve
okay the twenty third
So
you know sh- it was Saturday though so she had
I see
mom over for dinner
oh
and you
yeah and us
and then Sister Marilyn was there too
oh good
oh did you guys like it did she have fillet
so
yeah she did
She had that when we were there too
It wa-
It was it was really good
I love h- doing that having dinner at her house
yeah she always makes it
isn't that nice
it's well you know you can tell she enjoys making it
it's just good
I know she always
but I'd say
She made this salad dressing Amy after
I know what it is
ah eh do you
yeah
after she after she fi- we've all finished dinner I went back in the kitchen and ate some more
well sesame
Me too is it se- sesame she put sesame oi
mhm you know what no this is a different one I think this is the first
oh she must've made a new one
yeah she made a new one but it was really good
oh
she was telling me about the sesame oil one
really
yeah I should try that one
that's my favorite
well remember we you and I went to the first one she made
I'm not
It was me you Bob and the kids
oh yeah
then she had Andy and Chris once and she had Yvonne and Patrick once then she had just mom
and Yvonne and Patrick once
oh I think that's it
And then
She's had a dinner every year
yeah yeah it's so expensive couldn't believe it
how fun
I know
So anyway
but yeah so what else
oh Steven
a couple of weeks ago had a pain in his side
brought him into Elvo and he said oh I think he's constipated and I'm like well that's possible because I did run out of fruit
and Steve is like a big fruit eater you know
oh
How funny , I ran out of fruit
yeah
So I ended up giving him an enema type
not a real enema but like this oil thing
uhhuh
and everything was fine and then today he laid back to have his hair rinsed out you know shampooing it
yeah
and he screamed in pain and and
pointed to the same spot
uh oh
So I'm like oh what's going on
So
I just kind of you know said oh you'll be okay
and then about a half hour later he's on the f- computer room floor
crying
and I'm like Pau- Bob what's wrong with Steve and he was complaining about his stomach again
aw jeez
So we brought it him into Elvo and then
He said he
he said he either had problem with his kidneys or appendicitis
oh no
So he tested his urine and i- nothing showed up in that so he said it's most likely
his appendix is sore
and probably inflamed
and so it probably inflamed but he didn't really want to do anything
No you mean because it's obviously not
you know
0
that severe I don't know
going to
oh how funny
so he said just wait it out and keep an eye on him
So I'm like oh
yeah you don't want it to burst or whatever
yeah
oh usually they well you'd think they'd send him in for an ultrasound to look at it
I would think so but maybe because of the holiday
you know
yeah
I don't know
No it's Rosie got a half hour oh yeah Lacey says who is it oh
Do you have to leave
oh do you have to go
No
oh okay
eh no I said he just said who is it so
oh
aw that's scary that
oh tell him I said hi
I know
yeah he just walked away I wonder if
okay
oh brother
Well if he has pain are you going to take him to the hospital any more pain
yup
yeah yeah and it was funny because he's like
and when you take him to the hospital don't go anywhere else but Lutheran General I'm like Lutheran General what
ohmygosh
an- an- and then Bob's like well we go to Lake Forest and and I and I real quick spoke up I'm like
he doesn't like Lake Forest right in front of him
oh he doesn't
No I don't think so he didn't stop me you know he didn't correct me
so
Lutheran General I wonder if they have like a special kids'
they do it's that they have that's uh pediatric emergency
because it's so big
oh I see so they know
so it's a special unit
yeah he's like no if you have kids that need to be operated on that's where you need to go
they know
oh really
yeah so anyway I thought that was interesting
So how's wor
I was going to say that's I was going to say that's good to know but it doesn't do us good here
I'm stupid I'm so stupid work is okay it's better
Jack was like Jack was Lutheran General right
that's funny
um yeah I
Is it
have gotten to know
what are you
the people a little bit more they've they've been there for two years all of them and
yeah
yeah
so
I was like the n- the only new girl that I think they've ever had
wow
maybe one of them anyway so
so what are you doing though
working as a nurse doing at a medical center so it's like taking blood
oh
doing helping with procedures
yeah
um cleaning doing reception stuff like that
oh wow
it's just all different things
yeah
but I don't know if I want to stay there for a real long time but it's nice now because it's only five hours a day
oh wow
I know it's kind of
that's nice
I it is nice because
eh when I first got here I got this job and it was like eight hours a day eh w- sometimes it was twelve hours a day and I just got I was so overwhelmed and
uh
yeah
because like I felt oh I got to do stuff at home and I'm just not getting time to do anything and I never got to see anybody and it was just a month but it was really overwhelming
yeah
yeah
just to have a fulltime job right away
yeah
but
I bet
So now this is this has seemed
this is better for me
good
so I like it
that's neat
yeah and then what else
that's
So that's good and
what have you guys been doing for fun
obviously having your party
we've
yeah we ha- eh have been decorating
getting ready for Christmas we made a really big gingerbread house I just wrote you a letter so you're probably going to hear all this again
oh
You g- you guys
We had we got a
gingerbread house
made a big gingerbread house one weekend
yeah
we went away
last weekend with Leith's work
oh really
because yeah they
where did you guys go
gave us
they gave us a weekend away
oh
Well they the whole little office went to
this motel or
uhhuh
on the beach so we
that was
okay we went with
his work and
we went to the beach
oh how fun
so kind of stayed the weekend on the beach so that was nice
bet it's that does sound fun
yeah it is
was but it's yeah
funny because y- I don't really like the ocean
you don't well I don't like swimming in it
No I I I know I don't like it
I mean it's pretty to look at but
I
yeah well that's I like sitting out there but that's about it
that's about it I don't like I would never want to live on the beach
me neither
it scares me I'm afraid to get eaten by a shark
Well
So
when I was down in Florida with Maureen Quinn when I was a freshman
right
we were playing I mean just jumping up and down into the waves
and a jellyfish did I tell you this
yeah
No
It stung me under my arm and my whole side was par- not paralyzed numb
oh my gosh
for like three days I mean it was weird
and ever since then I'm like I am not going into that water
yeah I don't like it
because you can't see the stupid jellyfish /
No you can't see anything
and they're clear
And what if a shark came up when y- I mean you're in the waves
yeah
I know it sounds ridiculous but it does happen here
oh really
oh yeah
so I don't know
you mean there eh you're not you're not exaggerating
well I don't think I'm being like
a big baby
no
I don't make a big deal about it I'll go in the water but I just don't go any more than my waist
yeah
I just don't like it
eh it's dirty
oh Amy how weird
yeah
yeah it's just it's so funny to think that that's a different place
I know it is it's so funny
I forget
I forget that you have different sit- circumstances
I know like
like we were just talking today at church like nobody decorates here like puts light on the house or anything
oh no
and I guess this street in
in one suburb decided they were all going to put lights up
uhhuh
so everybody was went and
like the group went down to see these lights
oh you're kidding did that
on the street and all it was was Christmas lights on houses
It's funny
isn't it funny they were all
that is funny
It's on the news and
oh Amy
like everybody's in like talking about these people with Christmas lights out
oh is that cute
I know
that's so funny
they just don't they just don't do w-
at all like the decorations that we do
w- no
and it's just a different yeah different feeling
you should see I went overboard with my house this year
oh isn't it fun though
ohmygod
I've got greens and lights on everything it's just it's so fun
oh shut up isn't it pretty
yeah it is it looks really cool
I love that
um
but because last year I didn't get to do it because the baby you know was born
yeah
so I was like oh I want to decorate so bad
I bet
so I had fun
I bet Scott's getting big I li-
oh he's such a monster
is h
yes
uh hey did you get our package
yes
you did did you see the pictures
yes
We were supposed to tell you we didn't open it
he had to have more surgery because he was
his feet were becoming deformed because of a tendon
and a nerve that had been injured
and the
huh
first surgeries
oh no
when he was four years old and he's
uhhuh
sixteen , now
uhhuh
and so he wasn't able to walk except on his toes
uhhuh
uhhuh
so he had big surgery again , and he's in a wheelchair
oh my , the poor guy
and he doesn't want to go to school in a wheelchair
uhhuh , uhhuh
but there's still reason to walk
though , he might
he wants to have tutoring at home
but they're still ah where they live
on forty fifth street
yeah
they'r-
they're there
uhhuh , uhhuh
mhm
Rod still working , doing oka
um
I think so , now last summer , my summer vacation was
very different
mhm
my summer vacation
um
was so short in Milwaukee
mhm
that I missed seeing that family
oh
mhm
I didn't even have a chance to see them
I did call
Terry and talk to her for just a short time
uhhuh
there was no way of getting to see her
uhhuh
and I missed some other people that I always see
yeah , yeah
but
oh , we had a big
um , sixtieth wedding anniversary celebration in Milwaukee
mhm
so a_lot_of our family were /
oh
there
yeah , I guess Ray had
but we were with
told me
Amways all the time that we were in Milwaukee , you_know
mhm
because um , people from out of state came
because it was our aunt and uncle that had sixtieth wedding anniversary
yeah , that was a helper
in Milwaukee
held her
uhhuh
yeah
um
the help that all left
Milly and
that's right they all flee
Dorthy and
uhhuh
yeah , I can
and
you'll see them when they first came
Eliz-
uhhuh
um
now you knew that Machine_O'Hallorann died didn't yo
yes , Marie sent , or somebody sent me
the big funeral announcement
aha uhhuh , uhhuh
and the Marion Hall Group kept me updated too
that's good i-
they keep me updated pretty well
oh that's nice
is it
ah , the Marion Hall Group
uhhuh
um
even
but my main work here is is presence like yours you_know
uhhuh
but then along with it I'm tutoring a_lot
uhhuh uhhuh
and I I'm was just working real hard with ah math and physics
mhm u-
because I haven't remembered all those formulas and everything
it's been so many years for you
it's been so many years , but
yeah , yeah
I'm getting it now
uhhuh good , good
so I'm helping some with their exams of recuperation
uhhuh
and um , it makes me realize what I'm going to be doing like next year
I might not
well let's say it this way
I'm I'm committed here for another year
yes
which would end June , and the last part of June
uhhuh
but I'm going to be asking for an extension of four four months to carry them
uhhuh
to the end of the school year
oh yeah
because /
they , they fail you know , in the third quarter because I'm on vacation already or something , and then on the
mhm mhm
final they can't make it up they can't /
mhm
do it and so they're failing
mhm
so I want to stay here until the end of the school year , but then it might be the end for me
uhhuh
every year gets a little harder here for me
yeah , I suppose yeah
with arthritis and
uhhuh
and so your arthritis is bothering you
things like that and I don't hear too well
uhhuh
uhhuh
that's another thing
but I might leave an open door yet
that if , if they feel that's it's okay , what I do here , you know
mhm , mhm , yeah
if they need me or something , and if
yeah , yeah
if it's the will of God , then maybe I'll just take like a three month vacation
uhhuh , uhhuh
in the states to try to get my hearing and and eyes and ears up to
get that ticket
cleared up
taken care of
yes
that's why I'm kind of like , I'm kind of on the fence right now
that's , I know exactly how that
with my decision
how that is
and do you , do you know how that is ,
I know exactly how that is , yeah , yes
you're going to be there forever , hu
yeah it looks like it
anyway , um , what was I going to say yeah I remember those days , is that
six seven years ago already , when we sat in that little room
and watched T V with sister Alcott
yes
oh , isn't she still a going strong
yeah , that's Em what's tha
I said she's still going strong isn't she Alcott
yes , and she wrote a little note
ah-
y- I think she's ninety two now
ninety oh I bet I missed her birthday , hu
yeah , I'm a have to look it
no it's in January , isn't i
oh , it's coming up yet maybe , I might quick must look that up
I think it's in January
oh , I'd be glad I make it
oh I've missed everybody's birthday
you sent , you
well first of all communication is very difficult here
yeah , yeah
telephone they , they don't have any okay
yeah
I mean , we have one here but it's you know , busy or
you're so far away from it when the call comes
yeah , yeah , we tried once before and they said you were sleeping
well I wasn't really
I went to bed early because I had a very heavy day last Saturday
uhhuh , uhhuh
and , now this saturday I was house cleaning
oh yeah
Th- they take their two weeks at at All Saints
tsk
I'm sure they'll d- they
the ones take a good week or more
We still h- the cook is not back yet from Christmas vacation
So
everyone who's who's extra busy , of course , you know who's doing the cooking , like tonight it was Benny and me
mm
uhhuh
I mean e- so all the people who are working
uhhuh , uhhuh
I mean y- y- it's like the people who are working get more work
and those who are retired sit in their room and read the newspaper
It blows my mind
It it really does
It really does
And I mean
As you
said
As you said , it's quite a different experience
huh
It's a different experience , you know
And I tell you what , we've got a I I mean I really appreciate our province
our sisters , the way we do things , etcetera
ah
okay
yeah , sometimes you have to move away to come back to appreciate that
I mean you know , it's
and it- it's and it's different
That's all you can say
It's /
mhm
okay
That's right
That's right
different and and they're
And and this experience is not the
you know , the same as if you would be on a little community
oh that's true
How many are ther
There's eight of us
and then we have a a ninth one who some in three or four days a week
It's th-
sister Gabriel Mary who's the
Malagash sister who's going to the university
Tsk , ah
So
okay
And and
So it's different
And st-
And the superior is only here half time
Well see that's what , when Benny was here she said that
And I couldn't figure I just
couldn't quite understand how that worked
mhm
mhm
It's a it's a different experience as I say
It's
um
Well , it's it's an experience where I think Francois did too much
oh
And so y- you have everybody not knowing really how to do
ah
So , it's
yeah
It's it's it's a growth experience
You know as each people are called to do more they'll they'll grow into it
uhhuh
Got you
okay , listen
Something else interesting
Last /
Wha
night last night
tsk
the woman from the paper here in town came /
uhhuh
interviewed us
It's probably going to be in the paper under in the probably on the weekend or when they do the religious section
oh Sabe- Sabrina
Sabrina Hayes
No this is /
Britten
Her last name was Britten
oh , okay
um
I don't know I don't know her Sabrina is the one who interviewed me
I I don't
okay
Sh- she was probably the educational one
This is the religious
oh , okay
um , and she had just done an article with ministers on the call
uhhuh
She referred to that a little bit and that was in last Sunday
oh , good
So this should it's going to be quite interesting to see what she does with this
oh great
We'll save you a copy or send you a copy
We'll probably send you a copy
okay
okay
yeah , I'd be interested
yeah
So you can see if we're
You can see if we're famous or infamous
oh shoot
yeah it will be good
She was she I she was interested
Shoot
in
uhhuh
uhhuh
tsk
She sat there a long time with us and took a pic-
took several pictures
mhm
mhm
So it would be interesting to see
She doesn't select them , she said
To see /
mhm
yeah , yeah
when they ch-
and and what happens with the article
uhhuh
So
So if it comes , if you get an article , you'll know what , um
She called a Mar she called Frances Margaret
a while b- since Christmas
mhm
wanted to come to do an interview with six of us
And Fr- /
mhm
said there were seven of us
uhhuh
So
Of course there were a number of people who volunteered not to be part of it
I can imagine
I can imagine
oh golly
yeah
And um , how was your mom's birthday part
okay , that worked out
it i-
it worked out in the end
We had Gracie had called to make sure that
mhm
we weren't ha- planning it the day that mom would be at dialysis
uhhuh
They said they were going to change the schedule so we chose Saturday
and made sure that mom's brothers and sisters and everybody else could come
Good
uhhuh
tsk
uhhuh
Well when a- when we were at home between Christmas and New Year's Gracie called just to double check
mhm
And they had changed mom's schedule back to Saturday
mm
So she maneuvered it worked it out so that mom would go at like at seven o'clock in the morning
oh good
So that meant she came right straight from dialysis
Sosh-
uhhuh
uhhuh
be at home for that little open house
uhhuh
mhm
They you know
yeah
The the people with the
that have the van that was supposed to because so she didn't have to get out of her wheelchair at all
It's just too /
oh good
painful
It's just too painful to get her in and out
It's
oh , I'm sure
I'm sure
oh
And she's getting but th- but it was nice
Tsk , her her brothers and sisters that were in the area were there
And
mhm
Dad's , well dad's , it's a sister inlaw who came came for it
That's were , that's where I guess , they would , um , they get involved in initial public offering , stock offerings
mhm
for companies ,
yeah
Listing companies on exchanges , creating ah , ah , depositories receipts in the United States for foreign companies ,
and so forth
Right
All sorts of things just to raise capital on public markets
mhm
And then there's the debt side , which is , um , the side which deals in bonds ,
mhm
they , they go out and they try and find buyers for bonds
Right
Institutional investors and so forth , , and then you've got the um ,
ah , the traders , the stocks and bonds traders and
Right
And the for- , I don't know if they do foreign exchange but , they , I'm sure they do even have that hedging and stuff
And then , aside from all those clear cut , kind of special , ah
ah , focus services , they've got , their , at least the big ones , like Goldman Sachs and others ,
have their strategic advisor services
Now the Goldman Sachs that works for Deutch Telecom ,
mhm ,
in privatization ,
um , they are in the equity side , they , They're doing what David did , they
Right
They're working with us to , to , um , help sell us as a company
mhm
To investors
On the public market
On the stock exchanges
In Tokyo , New_York , Wash- , ah , Frankfurt , London , and so forth
But , the , the , the investment banks that are driving me crazy are always strategic investors
Because they show up , and they , what they're out there to do is , there's a_lot_of companies that they can't , either can't raise money , or they can't raise the type of money they want on stock exchanges ,
mhm
They don't have enough credit worthiness to go out and get a bond ,
mhm
um , ah , so the way they want to get capital is through offering a strategic stake
in their companies
Selling a piece of the company on , ah , ah pu- , ah , you know , ah , that changes hands privately
Selling a piece of the company to a foreign investor usually
But they're selling it to yo
yeah
oh
So for example , I mean , without ah referring to any real deals ,
mhm
um , companies will come obvi- , ah , you know , there's , there's a_lot of ah , a_lot_of telecommunication companies that , that ,
ah , that come out and , and , they look for
um , for , for a you know , for a strategic ah , strategic investor
They're looking for someone to buy , they might be wanting to privatize in two or three years
mhm
But , um , in the meantime , they want to shape up their company , so they'll sell what , twenty five percent of the company to a private , to a foreign investor
mhm
And the foreign investor will come in and , and , and restructure the company , and then together they'll go ah , go to the stock market
Right
And it's an opportunity , it's a big opportunity for a_lot_of companies out there
But is that what you're dealing with , that's your realm of
Partly yes
um , I mean , I work in an area , ah , which is involved in international ah , foreign investment ,
mhm
um , and , and , actually a whole range of , of foreign business
And um , you know one area is our global partnership ,
with Sprint and Francetelecom
Right
And another area is our foreign invest- , foreign investments
okay
ah ,
And so , ah , we get all these , like I said , we get all these investment banks coming to us , and ah ,
and they're li- , they're , they're salesmen , and they've , they've , they've got something to hock
ah , some company that comes down and they've said , find us a buyer , and ah , , it , it , ah ,
it really can get on your nerves
Gosh
So what were you going to go to Tokyo /
fo
For example
Or what did you go to Hong_Kong fo
Well , those were ah , those were just consultations
Wit
um , , ah
Not with whom , but like with , pe- , with companies that you might invest in
With , with investment banks , with
mhm
Companies
huh
yeah
Gosh , I didn't know you were into such , the ah , financial market area
Well it's , yeah , that's , I mean unfortunat- , ah it's actually been quite good , it's been quite interesting ,
mhm
ah , I never knew anything about , really , that area before
I mean I've taken Cordon's financial markets , kind_of a class
Reall
mm , mm , ah ,
But you hadn't taken i
No , I hadn't taken anything like that ,
that's bizarre
so I never knew really , you know , ah what , ah , how to , you know , how you ah , what , what you were
you know , what a strategic sale was , what
mhm
investment banks do , and so I'm new , and that's actually quite interesting learning that
I know well because they want to be totally irish
even though like
ow ow Robby is not even irish so whatever
oh okay
but Dave is kind of weird so you know
yeah
but yeah
is when I think of Megan I think of
the only other Megan that I know and
that's not good but
she at school
no from high school
Megan who Burnett
yeah
and she spelled her name with an h too
mhm
how did
did she oh I don't know
yeah she did
that's disturbing
but anyway ooh god okay so I'm taking care of these kids right
or not Megan Kathy and Chris
mhm
I think I told you that right
mhm
taking care of them again
yesterday Chris puked
and so he he stayed home from afternoon school and I had to call and excuse him
and I called and I called Holtz and I was like can I have attendance please and they're like and this woman she was such a bitch it was like
this is attendance I was like
okay well I need to clear a student absence and she's like that's great
and I was like yeah Chris_Mears is sick right now he won't be home blah blah blah and she's like
this was she's like
are you his parent I was like no I'm his guardian
and then Kathy is sick today
and so she has a migraine and she's up sleeping her parents are going to kill me when they get home they'll be like look what you did to our children
they're dying
but out of school I feel so bad I was supposed to go pick up christian for lunch
at lunch time and his lunch started at eleven forty five I woke up at twelve oh five and I was like oh god
so I threw I was wearing like one of my blue night shirts you know and I threw on my black skirt and I raced over there and it was like twelve ten by the time I got there
oh god
I felt so bad
I mean I'm going to just be like
god I feel so bad you know
mhm
and it's like
god I took Nyquil for the first time in my life last night
unhunh
big mistake
yeah
I had like horrible nightmares I dreamt that I was my mother and my aunt and my cousin at the same time
it and I but I was a man at the same time too
mhm
it was a weird dream
it's not funny
no I was just reading that people who are schizophrenic have
much more bizarre dreams than
oh good
that's funny Jo just diagnose me as being a freak
most people
but anyway
ow ow it's hot
so I have a week until I go back to school
I hate you
I don't know I don't even know if I really feel like going back because I have eight o'clock classes that's too early
only two days a week though
do you have class every day now
three days a week
oh you
poop
that's not fair
what about you
shut up I have it every day
ooh
and
tuesday thursdays eight to
twelve thirty and monday wednesday fridays ten to one
mhm
it's not bad
nah
and then I also might do chorus I haven't decided but considering the way my voice is right now
I can barely hear let alone sing I don't think I'll be able to audition for the choirs
when is the audition
next week
oh no
so I'm like
well you can try and see
yeah
they'll understand
like Clair you know Clair studly voice woman
yeah
when she she was sick when she did her
her auditions for her university choir
uhhuh
there's there's university chorus and then there's chamber chorus and she got into chamber chorus
but she didn't get into university chorus which is you know supposed to be the lesser of the two because she was sick when she did that audition
that's funny
and I was like great that really gives me a lot of hope Margaret who kind of sucks already
compared to Claire
you do not
nah
so
so do you like your classes so far
yeah
you get you did you get down into the right math
yeah
good
and I I picked up a class and I'm auditing french
are you
yeah
what how come
just because I was losing all my french
and so you don't even have to do the homework do you
well yeah but I am because I'm afraid she will kick me out if I don't
oh
so if you decide you want to like take it for credit can you take the next higher course next time
I hope so
it would suck to have to take that class again
yeah but
I think they would and I I don't think I'm going to take because I don't need it for my major or anything so
yeah but you know you could so have you decided on a major
no
but it's not going to be french
I don't need it for my major what the hell Jo
well I don't need it for any major except french and I'm not majoring in french
you never
you could do comparative literature and you have to be fluent in another language
yeah yeah
yemenheneheh
well I won't do comparative literature then
weenie
so what are you majoring in today
the
fuck you
well good great posterity fuck you
comparative literature probably with a either minor or a double major in french
cool
yeah me
okay so I'm not majoring in anything you're majoring in but
you're like good thank god run away
ooh so ooh oh oh oh I have a Tim update Tim update have you heard about this
mhm
I haven't heard anything
okay I told you about how he went camping with Noel like a while ago right
mhm
yeah
and quote quote nothing happened
uhhuh
and then Dob told me that at some new year's party
Do you have a ta
A ta
Well I haven't
uhhuh
been ,
well I just got back uh , a couple days ago ,
uhhuh ,
but I
uhhuh
could if I wanted to , if I wanted to like
actually put a suit on , and lie out it would not be
I mean , it's a beautiful day , I'm sitting in a T-shirt , the window's open ,
aw
The sun's shining like it has almost every day this year , I just , you know ,
Rita you're making a big mistake by not running on over here ,
I know , I know , well it was , it was such a huge decision Diana , I was , just like I
yeah , oh , I totally understand ,
agonized over it ,
uhhuh
And then I thought , okay ,
I , I re- , and part of the thing was
I realized well you know if it's such a , if you're agonizing over this so much , then maybe I should just take a year off
And ,
mhm , mhm
You know , travel , and work , or just do whatever ,
mhm
So I , I mean at first , I , well I first said , okay , that's what I'm going to do , I felt like such a copout ,
Really
And then I was like , no way , this would be really fun , well I think it would be really good for me too , because I'm afraid I'm getting so boring ,
Borin
So , I need to go have ,
oh , yes , deadly boring
Because of being in school for so lon
So
yeah
O god ,
I guess
I'm a little worried
Is it ,
So
am I becoming borin
No
Not at all Diana , I think you have much , a much different approach than I do ,
um
and I'm going to try to get some of that next year
Yea- , speaking of getting some of that , um
I know our call's being recorded , but ,
How's it been in Scotlan
Well it hasn't been much fun , Diana
aw , so even /
But , but
the one who wanted to be your manservant , he's not
yeah , he didn't , well , he's still on holiday , so I don't know what the de- , well , okay , so he , so this guy's on holiday , the manservant , boy , um , house /
Right
boy
And what about carrot
And then
boy
Well , okay , he , the ah , the repressed homosexual , he has just returned from holiday ,
okay
O Diana , he's so weird
He is so very , very , weird
I can't even describe it to you
Well , you , your , your message was so funny , your email message
O mygod Diana I mean I wish , I wish you could have seen it
It was , it was it was prob- , it was probably one of the weirdest things that has ever happened to me ,
um
I mean , just in terms of , like , just all , like all the layers of issues that this young man is dealing with ,
It makes Jeff
Are , I think ,
Look like , um , like
O , Je-
Doctor Ruth , or something like that , I don't know
Yes , exactly
Wow
I mean , this young man has problems ,
And , but he's ,
okay , so then ,
But has he decided that you're his friend thoug
Is that , that , because that's the issue ,
Well ,
Because there's lots of people walking around with problems ,
I
but as long as they don't bother you ,
yeah
No , I think , when I think after that I was very cold to him , and I think I was pretty clear about ,
Tha- , That he had gone over the limit
Right
So , I mean so , so we're cordial , definitely
I mean , I
Right
Say hello to him , and whatever , but , I mean there's really no reason to have any other contact with him
mhm
Whatsoever
So okay
So he's
He was never in the picture , and he's certainly not now , but , and then who els
oh , well , there is this man that I see at the lib- , we , I study in the library almost every day , right ,
mhm
And there is this guy , and he's , I know he does classics , because I saw him at a classics seminar that I went to ,
okay
But I always see him , and I'm going to introduce myself to him , because he is so cute Diana ,
All right
He has like black hair , and he's Scottish ,
mhm
wow He is absolutely lovely
And he always smiles at me , he , so he knows who I am , because he always smiles at me when I walk by
Right , mhm
He like , wel- , he looks up and he smiles directly at me , so
You've got to work this thing like I did with the breakfast man
oh , I know , Diana
But you see , you are just so brave , and that's very good ,
well , I mean ,
And I'm just a big chicken
You should have seen my knees shaking as I threw
My phone number at him , it was ridiculous
Hi , ah ,
Call me sometime ,
yeah ,
Oh , sh- absolutely shameless
oh I think it's beautiful
Wha
No , it's beautiful , it's beautiful
um
You're a woman of the nineties
Well , and it , you know it worked ,
For a while
Well , of course
, I mean ,
Of course
It's not really on the market , one can only rent it for short periods , but ,
O well , you know ,
You know
yeah
I mean , I , I've been very good at you know , trying to figure out the difference between auditing a man , and taking him for credit
You know what I mea
Yes , yes
Yes , so far I've only been an auditor , but
Right , right
Oh , that's an excellent
Anyway ,
Thing
yeah , I've ,
yeah , yeah
I've been developing , I don't think I ever brought this upon the email , a junk food analogy
oh , tell
Like , because after a while I was feeling like , and I don't know quite what prompted this , feeling like I was treating men too much like junk food
mhm , oh , bingin
You know , like , you know , you don't really , you know it's like you walk by the vending machine , and you don't need , you_know , the
still
oh come on
Like there's any doubt
With me aslee
yeah
Well hey what difference between you falling asleep , If-
That's the usual thing anyway , righ
Wha
Well I f- I always fall asleep anyhow , so , no matter
No matter
We'll see , we'll see
I like this
I'm gettin-
Well more friends say hi actually
More fr- more friend
Wha
Wha
So y- so y-
More friends say hi
Friends from elementary school
you showed them pictures
Do you have any pictures left of me , or did all your friends take the
yeah
No I have some
I have a whole album full /
oh shit but not the good ones though , all the good ones have been taken
of you
Tsk
yeah , so I'm going to have to make copies , and get copies from you
uhhuh
mm
Tsk
yeah
See I told you
We did our high school reunion and then now
and yesterday we had our elementary reunion
That was yesterda
yeah , that was yesterday
uhhuh
It was weird
oh
The changes that
that
you know
people go through
Their faces
We- well hell , that's elementary school , babe
I know
And I don't think I've seen any of them , like
tsk
after that
in high school when st- when I was still here
So ,
it would have been eight years
Yesterday , before I saw them again ,
Bab
Let me let me let me tell you something
yeah
yeah
I do not keep in contact with
anyone
not one person
that I went to elementary school with
I remember when I act-
uh
just randomly met up with all of them
Did Nate go to elementary school with yo
oh , hell no
He went to ju- high school with me
N
I met him I met him sophomore year of high school
oh
oh
A friend of mine introduced us
huh
So you did not keep in touch with anybody
No one
How about middle schoo
Because we didn't have middle school here
We don't
Well junior high
So
I mean the one person I keep in contact w- with from junior high
yeah , junior high
I only do that because he also swims competitively in a college
And I see him like /
ah
at swim practice
who's this Bab
No this is
No
Jake Arms
oh
mm-hm
And Babs is from high school
mm-hm
So it gives you an idea , babe
We-
Well , well , we're we were very very close
We are ca- close
bunch of gals
mm
I'm just making fun of you
We were
We like each other's company
You did what to each othe
We like spending time with each other
You did wha
Wha
You did what to each othe
hu
Wha
hu
I said we like each other's company
You know I'm really upset with you
Wh
Well
because Zambo
has
his girlfriend is on the swim team
Ryan
his girlfriend
is on the swim team
Berko , his girlfriend came up for the weekend
So they're having a good old time
mm-hm
Not fair
oh
Poor Matthew , on the other hand
oh
But
poor
poor Munger
Wh
I I had like a hearttoheart with Munger
uh
two nights ago
An
oh that boy that boy is not in good shape
Wh
He misses Becky that muc
Hol-
sort_of like the antithesis of that
What do you mea
Well
it's something I would need
He's enjoying it really , huh
It's something I would need to talk to you in person about because it's so long and intricate
Really
I mean
Tsk
You know Hiam , he's really nice
She's
the antithesis of what he is , to an extent
I like that word antithesis , gosh
yeah
Y- y- yeah , h- h- you have
oh I used it twice in one sentence , I u- that's overused
um , well
Pretty much
put it this way , uh , Munger has a feeling that it's easier for a woman to cheat on a man
because all the woman has to do is say yes because she
uhhuh
always going to have
men hit on her
Whereas in a man to cheat on a /
uhhuh
like his girlfriend
is much more of a
conscious thing
because he has to actually go up to a woman and hit on her
Right
mm
okay
so I had
I that thought had never occurred to me
I always thought that men would cheat on their w-
girlfriends more than the womans w-
cheat on their boyfriends
And
that has
factual
basis with him
Wha
oh Becky has cheated on him many a time
and that's one of the
I thought only once
oh no
I just found this out
oh man
And
Well I was just telling him some experiences of mine with her in Spain
and just telling her
oh my
I've got the biggest grin on my face and I'm chuckling
god
Cindy is apologizing profusely
I look up at a
about a like a half a se- you know half a minute later
And
and Penny has this
you know
I think jokingly hurt or jokingly I don't know what
face on
It's jokingly mad , jokingly hurt
Right
But underneath those jokes
I just there's a part of her that goes
tsk
I wonder how often she's done this , and I wonder at what
points and activities she's done this
oh my /
So I just laughed
And I just , I you know nobody else said anything and
god
It was fine
What a
day
Tsk , and she said you know I said listen you know I'd I would like to
you know think
you know I'd like to talk to you about staying in touch and and things like
that
And I said I know that our friendship will never be the same , and I don't want it to be the same
It was not
I said
sh- I said you know when I think about you , which I don't do very often , in fact
I don't think I ever do except
you know at certain times which
I think st- I mean I saw a look of shock on her face and I'm like
you think I'm still thinking about you girlfrien
you know
so I
So it was just funny , it was the funniest thing
And I just thought once I got that closure
face to face and that connection face to face , I thought , you know what
I see the disdain in her face still
I see her eyes saying
you know
I don't I you know , I don't respect you
And once I saw those eyes of of disrespect /
yeah
I just thought
tsk , I don't want this relationship , I don't need it
I don- I don't need
Girl , you have come like four million miles
Well
you know
when you got good friends
you get to realize the shitty ones , who /
who think
you know , that you've always thought were good friends
So
Right
So , yeah , it's
Wow
You have just fucking gotten some shit done
hey , but you know , I have to tell you
I am very very very very proud of you
Because /
your last letter
to me
just showed great great
great great great strides
of being able
to share
your personal deep feelings
Reall
Yes , man
You , I mean
It was really good
That means a_lot to me Valerie
Really
Well e- e- I I've s- I'm just
I was just sitting there going
yes
yes
Good for her
Good for her , she's feeling that pain
oh , shit , I don't remember what I said , but god
you're sharing it
Well you were just you were just saying how you've you have really
you know
great days , and you have really terrible days where you just want to go off
eh where you do go off into the mountains and just cry
yeah
And how you really really deeply miss people and things like that
And I just thought good for you
that you
are sharing that with me
Because it's one thing for you to feel it
It's another for you to actually write it down and tell me
yeah
And I was just very proud of you
And I just had to tell you that
ohgod
thankyou
That I see , I also see great
great strides
in your issues too
thankyou
So
You know I couldn't do without you pulling my ass along
Well that's a good thing
We just keep
oh girl
no
E- e- do you got a col
Excuse me
I don't know I woke up with this shitty cough
And it just keeps like
I miss English , ohmygod
I miss English
oh I bet you're just like totally overwhelmed with everything
Girl , sometimes I just miss it , because you can play with the words /
so much
And I mean that had
such feeling What you just said had such feeling to it
I could never express that in Spanish for my life
Give it time
Give it time girl
ohgod
Does this thing
does this thing give you like five minutes
warnin
It gives you like a minute or something like that
oh good
yeah
yeah
So hey g- Wild Asparagus is coming to Cincinnati
ohmygod
Let me just
get a little more wet
That is /
not
fair
That is /
just not fair
I tell you
I-
if I don't dance
soon I'm going to
die
I bet
W- e-
I mean
You're doing tons of
that I pay
You're doing tons of traveling , aren't yo
um
When I go to Madrid I dance salsa
hey girl
Wha
You been getting an
Girl
Girl it's such a long story that I that's why asked about the time I don't even want to embark
but it is just like the most fucked up
story okay
Wh- when I first went to Madrid for that month /
uhhuh
uhhuh
I met this motherfucker and I swear to
god I would marry him
You're kidding
No , Valerie , you don't understand , I
think for real the first time in my life
I was
actually in love
You're kidding
But we're here doing exciting stuff today Mike actually went out to a shooting range with some
mhm
ah
other guys in the neighborhood you know there's a_lot_of international people in this neighborhood from
Canada Denmark Norway
France
Australia United States
Let's see what other country Singapore Indonesia
China Taiwan Hong_Kong
Let us see where else
um the Phillipines
um those are they folks we've met so far anyway
and so from England
you know just from a_lot a_lot_of place that
some of the guys went out to a shooting range today and I'm home with the kids
We're trying to make granola you know you can't buy it here and
trying to find the raw ingredients is a treat and a half too but we finally got everything and made granola so that was our big excitement for the day
okay
the you you don't get to carry weapons around do yo
oh no oh no no one does
okay so you go to the shooting range and pick them up there
yeah they have
I don't know if it's a military shooting range or a private one or
military one that private people could go to but
basically if you pay your money they'll let you
shoot whatever you want they've even got the out there for goodness sake
oh yeah I mean
oh well
so
gee I thought about buying an S K S you ever heard of tha
uh
oh it's
I don't know what that is
it's it's basically a Chinese assault rifle it's you know sort_of war- government surplus actually
Russia has them and China has them and the Russians are supposed to be better
but like they come to the United States in a crate for like a hundred dollars
hm
and this is a semiautomatic weapon with
eh you know you can buy
a case
the rounds fort in a readily
and
so Charles has one
and I tried it out and I decided gee I ought to get one if I was ever going to get something but then I worried about keeping it safe
mhm
that's the thing you know if your house ever get broken into or something
yeah then you feel so responsible for
something happening and it's a little bit of overkill for deer hunting you know
so
No it's perfect for deer hunting
I don't know I personally don't care for guns is i
yeah it would it would be perfect
yeah I I just don't care for guns
yeah well we we we c- we aren't supposed to have them around where I work I'm
I'm really disgusted I got called in this morning
when you know I take care of these little juvenile delinquents
mhm
and they
uh one of them complained
they complained about me eating cold cereal on the unit you_know when I work at night they don't feed us
So he's complaining about me eating cold cereal
mhm
and practicing the acoustic guitar
while he's locked behind a steel door trying to sleep
mhm
and you know it just
petty they just trying to play power games and
but the boss said well okay no guitar
so that eliminates an hour of practice a day that I got paid for by the state while I was sitting there watching the kids with the
you know he's complaining about the other guy snoring
so what do they want anyway
Hold on just one second there's something quiet down
oh Eddie and Sarah have to fight whenever the phone rings you know
oh
But anyway
mhm okay
so but the weather here is incredibly nice it's
just about every single day it's bright blue skies and sunshine
and
mhm
It now it's down in the the teens and the twenties sometimes although it did get a little bit warmer the past couple weeks of
yesterday and today it's back down cold again
yeah
But it's really not bad sight seeing whether I told Ruth and Charles they should come in the Winter time there's
there's hardly any tourists here so nothing is crowded
and you can go sight seeing and see all kinds of stuff without worried about really heavy crowds
That would be nice
don't have crowds around the square anymore hu
Well there's plenty people there but they're all flying kites
oh okay gone to flying kites
so
that's the big pastime Sunday is the the
Sunday is like family day and kids' day
yeah
So they all go there to fly kites although this Sunday is is uh Chinese Lunar New Year it's the biggest holiday in China
and it's kind of like Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one
Right
and it's called Spring Festival now
yeah that's right it
a big deal
It is the new ye- it is the new moon I
I sta- when I get off work I see tha- the moon get older and older and older as it
you know when it was just a real sliver yesterday
yep
so
and this is supposed to be the one day in the year that these monsters called the neons can come and
bug people so everybody
where's red makes lots of noise and shoots off fireworks to scare away the neons
to keep the neons away
yep
okay
so tha-
wow
ready for the new year
and we got some fireworks and the kids have their little red lanterns to scare them away and
Sarah is actually quite concerned about it I mean she goes Mom I don't want the monsters to eat me
oh
because you_know they've been reading stories at school and everything getting ready for the new year
and all you just have about
but Eddie and Sarah
We just had Valentine's Day and I went to a Valentine's Day dance and you know like half the women wore wore red dresses
um Typus this is the one that
Tsk oh wait I also have one quest-
There are
there are two
there are two problems that I've sort of been working on in
you know in e- w-
off and on
um one is
you have three schools
exactly n people at each school
each person at each school knows at least n plus one of two n people at the other schools
Prove that there at least three people who all know each other knowing knowing is mutual
That
yeah
oh you know who you should talk to about that one
Dav
No
Wh
Let's see
Who do we know that's into statistics
Stev
That's not statistics
It's a combinatorial problem
That's statistics
There's a there is
No
Yes set set sets of n probability /
is probability and statistics
Probabil-
No no no
It's not probability it
No I know
But
prove that that it must
It involves stati- i-
Right
But I I mean I've gotten I've
like
e- there I tried I tried the simplest way to solve it and that
that isn't
that isn't enough
And then I'm working on the second one which says something like
okay
at the first school you have n people who know n plus one
people
out of two n people
That means that they know n squared plus n of two n people
they're right yeah
I I I it's not going to make any sense until I sit down with a pencil and paper and s-
Like
okay
okay well
That's the only way I understand maths is like
okay
I don't
Sorry
until I've worked on it
I like
No it depends on how complicated i-
okay well I'll I'll send you e- if you want I'll send you these two questions that I'm working on
yeah
That would be good because
Because
because it's like
e-
e- they're they're w-
they're not difficult problems
And
and I understand exactly what's happening in them
um or I mean I understand plenty of what's happening
I'msure there's there's a_lot more that I don't understand or else the solution would probably be really simple
um
but i- it's it's really fun but really
but e- I wish it it were were going more quickly
um
But I I'm just
I'm really really happy this person
you know posted this list of things
And the the really the really cool thing about it is
yeah
um
like
there are a_lot_of problems that
like there are some problems that that because of the geometry center
I was able to to
like give answers to immediately
And then there are others
What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in hal
yeah
Now what does happe
E- I'm no- I'm not sure on that one
I haven't
D- do you did did you did you save that list someplac
I have the
um U R L
okay
Because because e- what I could do with the problems that I'm working on is just
give you the numbers if you /
yeah , let's see
I'm trying to
wanted to look at them
That would I mean that would be easier
Now
But
I I actually I have stuff saved in a text
Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two Moebius strip
hu
I said if we're cutting the Moebius strip in
in half
wouldn't you just get two Moebius strip
No , that's not what happens
W- why no
Cut a Moebius strip in half and you'll see
But w-
cut cut in half which wa
Lengthwise
okay , yeah
That I didn't
Draw draw a line in the midde-
oh wait never mind
yeah
That wouldn't work
The the
draw a line in the middle of the Moebius strip and cut
along that line
W- okay I
Yes
That's right
I see what part of the problem would be then
And and the thing that probably was the most humbling thing
is you know the
the description of
of the circle in Boston
yeah I saw that
um
Eye to the eye
yeah
Wait
ah
and
I don't know I I I've never dealt with imaginary so I'm not sure
yeah , I mean well it has to do with complex numbers
And Igot
When hen I get back I I
I
can try to explain it
it to you because
someone did explain it to me
And i-
i-
I I don't completely understand it but I think
Now I want to figure it out
After going through
I I
know enough about complex numbers that
I theoretically should have a clue if I like
okay , well I certainly I I
maybe then then you can when I get back explain everything you know about complex numbers because
It's been a long time
um
Well
between now and then you can figure it all out again
Cool I'm really hoping whoever it was that hit my page in the geometry center liked it
Like
they were looking at it three times so
Three times
Yes
How do you know it was the same perso
It was
It was like three times like in a row so it was like you_know flipping back between pages
That's really weird
Well I mean this is this is when they're making decisions
So it's entirely possible that you'll get a job at the geometry center and then I probably won't
But
you know
that would be
oh really
well yeah it depends like they tend to get more at their international meetings than domestic ones
that's interesting
so
yeah , yeah
yeah I just got my confirmation a couple weeks ago of my my my paper
oh really are you doing dissertation stuff or
yeah , yeah , yeah yeah
yeah well that's cool
but all we have to send is the abstract
yeah see that's how law and society is but not
yeah I'm surprised you have to send the whole paper
yeah I know oh well
well yeah what can you do
oh well last night or actually
friday night and saturday morning I went to I got invited to the embassy
the
was very cool
US embassy
yeah yeah the ambassador here Swanee hunt
cool
she
has this thing called the Vienna women's initiative
uhhuh
so where she gets women leaders from former eastern bloc countries
neat
and tries to connect them with americans and viennese women
and so I I kind of got invited so I was pretty excited
yeah that's nice
yeah yeah and I met a lot of really neat people there
yeah
I mean I wasn't as particularly as interested in the ukrainian women as
some of the other women you know to kind of connect with on my work and stuff it was really cool
right
that's nice
yeah , yeah
was it a nice place
oh my god it was beautiful it was at her residence
oh
which is kind of out more towards the suburbs
uhhuh
and it was really she has like a ton of art there
oh yeah
yeah a lot of different kind of
art I mean you know all original sculptures and
right
really interesting stuff but she never showed up for any of the things I was really surprised
she wasn't there
no isn't that odd
that's odd yeah it is odd
yeah I thought so too
considering it's that it's her house and all
yeah really well
I mean all her staff was there and there was you know a lot of different
right
you know diplomats there but I don't know
oh well what can you do
yeah yeah
how's Matt
Matt is good he there's like total chaos at the UN as you might imagine
oh
and his boss told he
this other woman who came in through exams like he did and the other lawyer
mhm
uhhuh
and said I don't know what's going to happen but there's always going to be a job for you guys
oh that's nice
yeah but they're thinking about getting rid of the entire office /
but in a way but see Matt has a permanent contract and so the UN is obligated to try to place him
so he'll have to be
somewhere
so in a way it might be a good thing for Matt
yeah
if he got sent to new York or something
yeah would they feel as though they're obligated to place him even though the US isn't paying their dues
yeah they don't do it like that no
no they don't it's not eye for an eye
no it's not like that really
yeah well that's that would be nice
yeah and Matt just found out actually on friday that he's on the short list for that job he interviewed with yeah
really
well that's nice
yeah so that's
how did he hear that
he talked well they said when he was leaving they said in a kind of joking slash serious way
mhm
don't call us we'll call you
and so he's like you know it's been when was that December
right
it's been a while and he he's not going to
call because he doesn't want to be like a nag
oh right
and they said don't call
right
but he was able to call the personnel office
in new York and and try to find out through there
that's good
and so then finally he spoke with this woman who knew and said well we just put the short list together
I'm assuming it's like three people I mean that's usually what it is
right
right
and you're on it and we have to interview people off of it the rest of the people off of it so
what do you mean
well I I guess that means that the other people on the short list weren't interviewed yet
oh
so yeah
so that means inside track thing
I think what it means is they just screened things by resumes and applications
and Matt happened to be so close that they had him come in
but Matt made that interview happen since he was there
oh that's good so that was good for him
yeah and now they don't have to fly him out there or anything
right and I'm sure it couldn't have lowered his chances to make the short list
yeah I mean I don't know
that's great I bet he does good in interviews
so yeah I think he I think he did well but you know it's always so hard to say
well he made the short list
yeah true true true good point
well that's nice that's good
yeah yeah
well that must make him feel good
mhm mhm
that's good so
so he's like
even if he doesn't end up getting it he knows he was he was pretty close on the first try
yeah yeah
that's good
that's true
well
yeah so hopefully and he's been recommended for a promotion
oh great
and his boss is like really pushing and called an emergency meeting of the promotion board /
really
to try to push he and this other woman through
I thought the boss was not liked
well he's not but I mean he's trying to I think he what he's trying to do is set things up before things fall really
uhhuh oh that's smart
and so Matt is kind of psyched because I mean things are oh and they've been told that they have to fire one professional and one secretary
really
