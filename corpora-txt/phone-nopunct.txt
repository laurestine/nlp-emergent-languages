Right
and I
I already got another apartment
for when I move out
oh you did
yeah
Wher
its on the corner of Columbia and Cole
uhhuh
and its a one bedroom and
so I had to put down like a deposit and
you know and pay the rent for it so I could hold it
mhm
but thats okay
oh good
Then I wont have to you know how
all the people are looking for houses now
yeah
yeah Im sure they are
well thats good
well so what have you been doing other than wor
um
Not really much of anything
um
I usually I just come home from work and like stay home
and
e I dont know
I havent done much
uhhuh
We went to SantaFe yesterday
oh yeah
you know me and Henry
Well thats cool
yeah but otherwise
its been a kind of boring summer
mhm
Like nobodys here
Just like Henry and Leroy
yeah
yeah its been boring for me too
but
at least Im saving money I guess
yeah when are you coming bac
The nineteenth
oh
When does school star
The twenty second
oh okay
I dont even know
I just knew it was around the twentieth
yeah
I think its the twenty second
mhm
but
yeah
Have you talked to Le
um yes
I havent talked to him since I think like Tuesday
mm
but hes coming back to Albequerque tomorrow
oh he is
yeah
I thought he was going to Philadelphia
No
No h
he doesnt have the money
oh okay
and then I couldnt get off work
oh
so if he came then
like I would still have to go to work
oh okay
so we decided that that was a waste
Because when you went
to Oregon he told me that he was
he wasnt going to be back until like August because he was going to like visit you
yeah
yeah that was originally the plan but
then like apparently my mom agreed
oh
that I would work for this place for exactly three months
Like and I didnt know that
mm
so Im required to work until the sixteenth
oh
so
its kindof a bummer
Well that suc
Are you
you guys are staying in the house righ
ca
yeah
yeah
Thats what Lee said
I forgot
yeah
but whos going to live with yo
I dont know
I was hoping it was going to be you
oh
but
oh well
Lee said that that you guys wanted to try to live by yourself
No thats what he wanted
oh okay
because he told me because he told me you know that you guys
that was
because Suzy was moving out and then he said
if I w if I needed a place to stay I could stay there
but you guys had wanted to like try and live
just you two
oh
Well that wa that was his plan
and I said to him no I want to live with Stephanie
oh really
I didnt know that
I wouldnt have gotten like my apartment and
oh really
yeah
oh
Im sorry
Well blame him
Maybe you could get your money back now
I dont know
I mean if
its a month to month lease so Im sure
oh really
yeah
How muc
but I d
Its two ninety five a month
mhm
Which is pretty good
yeah thats good for a one bedroom
yeah
I might
I dont know I think that I want to live by myself
yeah
Well youve wanted that for a while
yeah
so
Now that I have but I didnt I wouldnt have done that
if I would have known it was like definite that you wanted me to live with you
Well th but I said to him I dont know if Stephanie could live with me because Im such a slob
oh
I cant live with with Henry and Leroy because theyre slobs and theyre
and they dont listen to me
yeah see I thought you w you might have like gotten used to living with slobs
oh
since they were
Well no its just that they like I mean Im sure you would respect my like cleanliness
but they dont
yeah
No I I try and keep it all in my room
but
mm what is Ann going to d
um
I dont know
but I know that she wont live with me because I hate John
oh I forgot about him
yeah
Thats that was like the last thing she said to me before I left
oh
was that we could never live together because of him
Which is fine by me
yeah
Because you know when he comes he comes for like three weeks
yeah
and I would just go insane
yeah
hm so I I really hate him
I had to I had totally forgot about him
I guess I k sort of like blocked him out
I I think most people do
but
yeah
so
Thats kind of that
but its weird
I havent heard from her all summer
reall
yeah I wrote her
but she didnt write back
mm
but her birthday is Thursday so I should probably call
I think
I dont know
Have you talked to Netti
No
mm
No I havent
w we played pool with them like on Saturday night
uhhuh
with her and Anders
and some guy named Mica
oh thats oh I know him
Hes my my friend Medeas brother
oh thats Medeas brothe
yeah
oh wow
yeah
They dont look like each other
Ive a Ive actu
h I dont know if Ive ever Ive only seen him from afar
oh
He looks like John Travolta but he has like curly blond hair
oh really
yeah
Hes supposed to be pretty cool
yeah he is
He was real nice yeah
He i
oh thats good
Well thats nice
Anders doesnt live with him does h
No um hes like Nicks friend or something
oh
Or
Mick or whats that guys
Mays boyfrien
m
I dont kno
Nick
yeah Nick
yeah
and I guess like Nick and May were going to go but they didnt
but they asked this guy
Mica
mhm
to come
I dont know
Now do Nettie and Anders live togethe
No
Anders is living at like on Wesley
I dont know if he lived there before
Still with that guy Mark
Right
yeah
and
and Nettie like started living in this place
on
Girard
uhhuh
You know h like going to your house
oh okay
and
you know across the street from Jefferson
Jefferson Middle School
yeah
Thats going to your house righ
yeah
She lives right across the street from there
oh well thats nice
and she lives with somebody named
Christine and
yeah
Lily or something
yeah they were in one of my classes with her
mhm
I remember
Like Christine shes kind of big
yeah
yeah
and then Lily is like has blond hair
I dont know if you know her
I dont think I know her but Ive heard of her
yeah then its like
hm
When did she move in ther
Like in June I think
uhhuh
Is it nic
Its okay its kind of gross
Like
oh
Theres like roaches all over the place and stuff
ohgod
Nettie would hate that I think
yeah she was going like
quite crazy
and like I guess the girl who had it before like didnt know how to clean like
period
and it was all gross and stuff
uhhuh
but they
we went
on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so
mhm
I guess its okay
oh
Well thats good
mm
yeah
The only person I talk to is Mark Diener
Ho how many times have you talked to hi
He calls every Thursday
Really
yeah
but hes just so cute I cant say no
Hes gotten much better too
oh really
yeah he doesnt get on my nerves
but he gets on my moms nerves
oh really
Because when she answers the phone he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour
and then shes always like I have to go I have to go
Typical Mark
definitely
so I I told him that my moms like afraid of the telephone and she doesnt like to talk
but
hes the only one
m
yeah
hm
I does anyone hang out with Suz
mm no
No
Thats good
I guess
I guess little Felipe is staying at your house
yeah I heard that might happen
yeah
and
I bet she loves that
oh yeah And every time I ask because I see him at Kinkos all the time
uhhuh
and
Hes like
she never leaves the house
All she does is bitch
But its so true
He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then
stays home like the rest of the day
yeah
Why am I not surprise
yeah
so when I was thinking of who I was going to call because you know this phone call is free
oh it i
yeah and I was
so we can talk as long as we want
and like
Well actually its supposed to turn off in fifteen minutes
I think the whole thing is screwy
oh
but
you know my dad was like well why dont you call Suzy
and Im like that is the last person that I want to talk to
For fifteen minutes
I mean I talked to her
like
three weeks ago
and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill
Which I did
and she just forgot
Because she spent the money on something else
and I was just like whatever
Shes totally nutsy
If she like ends up trying to stay Im going to have a nervous breakdown
Well I think shes already determined to leave isnt sh
yeah but see its just like her the last minute be too lazy
Right
to go through with it
yeah I mean thats just
generally speaking her personality
yeah
Because she was telling us she was going to move out last January
mm
and she was too lazy to do it
so
maybe Felipe will drive her out
ohgod I cant stand her
So anyway how are you doing these day
Things are going very well
I think I had mentioned before that um that uh that uh that theres a company now that Im working with
um uh which is very much just just myself and Guss
oh
And that
No you hadnt mentioned that
eh oh okay
okay so
eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers
And
Well i well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to to just kind of set up my own company of sorts
So
oh
So things are going extremely well
So I had one client who said that hed pay me a minimum amount
You know hed he uh there would be a minimum amount of work of about uh a day a week for the next two three years
mhm
Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it would make sense to do this
And
and um Ive been getting substantially more work than then
mm
So Im quite pleased quite pleased
Well thats good
So um so I have a bunch of work that I need to do on my flat this year
Ive been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time
But it should uh it should come out this year
oh well thats good
It should be done in a few months
oh yeah I remember
So
you talking a little bit about it at one point
yeah yeah
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soo
um
I dont see the finances occurring
uhhuh right
for a while
um actually right at the moment finances are not going real well
But
ah well
I am working on that one
uh
Its just
But
uh uh the the the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up
ah
uh related to a couple of burglaries that I had
oh harsh
Harsh
yeah
yeah but and
Not a whole lot I can do about that now
Indeed
Indeed
have to deal with the situation
And
So thats what Im doing
Sounds good
But
Anyway
One of the main reasons that Ive been such a pathetic uh correspondent has been work
Ive actually been doing alotof it
oh wow
And uh I turned in my Masters thesis back in May and Im actually presently working on um
several uh articles
oh okay
Impressive
from it
yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little
bit in what I was doing uh is going to turn out to be very important in the end
And uh
from what I had been reading in the literature
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half
yeah
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there wasnt much discussion
yeah
yup yup
But
Anyway I had been
kind of telling him that you know from my reading of the literature I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique
mhm
And it f made
w the one type of solution occur which
was seen experimentally but none of the other models had uh ha
Yes
They basically the I Im looking at um multi mode lasers
And one of the
things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased uh states where
if you look at the total intensity
uhhuh
of the laser you get
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency
Yes
okay
If you look i if you separate out the different modes of the laser
mhm
and look at one of those you get more than one frequency
okay
So whats happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each others
Exactly
hm
oscillations on these other frequencies
And
uh
you can
With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency
in a transient but you cant find that frequency in a driven uh frequency
You cant find so that it will sustain
okay
Yes
So
yeah that that particular frequency according to most models
damps out very quickly
And so you shouldnt actually really be able to ever see it
hm
The only thing is that when you do the experiment you see it
Got it got it
I see
So um I found a
simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty
And in most cases uh insoluble
But
yeah
it gives a driving term
oh okay
So it actually
creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer
you just cant always write it down very easily
Exactly
oh wow
So so so you you youre pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser
laser uh whatever it is science
But which um is kind of interesting considering that thats not really my thing
Indeed
Indeed
Be being an experimentalist not a theorist
But
Indeed
oh wow
oh impressive
But
So so so are so are you going to get an article in Nature or somethin
um actually
Im not sure if were shooting for op I think
Optics Letters is probably the one that were shooting for or else perhaps though
I dont think its quite that significant would be Phys Rev Letters
hm
But uh we want to write a letter and then a couple articles
yeah
hm
impressive
And
I I dont know how much you know about scientific literature but letters are much more prestigious than articles
oh okay
oh w I I didnt realize that
okay
yeah so that thats why its actually a big deal is
I mean you know writing a couple of articles based on your Masters thesis is
not at all unusual in Physics and
yeah
uh i its the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all
And whats actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that
people have been seeing th
You know people see the anti phased motion and its true they do in the transients And
I was having alotof trouble getting across to him that all of the literature is in
has this frequency in the transients
Yes
eh and not driven
And uh what happened was after I had turned in my thesis
but before I saw Neil again he went to a conference in Rochester and there
this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work was
that their models couldnt show this as a driven frequency yet their experiments showed it
as a driven frequency
oh cool
And s and so Neil
then
Said oh just a second I
like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said hey Lowell we got to write this up
Exactly
And I was like well Ive been telling you that Neil
Indeed
So
Cool
Thats
Cool
thats mostly the sort of stuff that Im spending alotof time on now
um
Well itll look good on your C V your resume
So so you might as well spend the time
Yes well uh th no its definitely worth doing
um
and I would have been spending more time on it if it werent for uh dealing with the burglary issues
oh yeah but
that Ive been dealing with
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park
Yes
yeah okay
yeah
I mean the thing that i this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to
oh
Its not a question of whether or not
you know that that was easy it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into
Exactly
Exactly
yeah
And so the problem is that now they found out that its worth breaking into
yeah
And unfortunately
Well i its kind of odd
Theyve stolen very weird things for the most part
hm
A as far yeah as a
The first time they broke in they
what they stole was just bizarre mostly worthless
stuff
And
huh
the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the preamplifier of my stereo
Unfortunately because its a nice preamplifier it has an off board power supply which they didnt steal
which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless
huh
So
Thats bizarre
Bizarre
So so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh the off board amplifie
Actually no all they stole the second time was my bike
huh
Which was actually where the major problem came
Exactly
Exactly
yeah
Is that I suddenly had no transportation
And so
I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike and
mm
that that cost me alotof time
yeah
Exactly
Because yes
Spending alotof time hunting for bikes and
nah well
then getting one purchased and then having to
you know go get it and things like that
But
thats dealt with at least
And so
uh thats yeah
at least dealt with
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this
But
yeah
yeah
At least
Well that would make sense
during the summer I can actually
uh
according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship I can actually earn money during the summer
But um guessed what happened
Wha
um
The
Agai
Lets see two weeks ago
I know Sue is going to r Rhode Island
eh Right Right
Did she see her mo
Yes she did
An
Yes she did

um which was um which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen
I spoke to her mom on Thursday and
and I asked her I said listen I said please come to Shabbat things have come to a point where I may have to resign relinquish my
uh parenting
uh would you mind taking her back and she said no
She said shed be more than happy to
Reall
This girl is like has everything in her dreams you know
It it is it is it is it is as my husband says uh
uh Alkadir the destiny Selema Im telling you it is like Allah has just painted the road and all I had to do was get on it and follow it
I I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me
I told mom I said mom it is when you believe in Allah when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah
only Allah can make the way clear for you
uh
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother
Reall
mhm mhm
And and and is she seem like shes together enoug
Shes in a shes in a two year program
Shes in the program now
Shes doing very well
When I talked to her its a I Im talking to her like Im talking to you
I wrote her a letter and told her I said I think I said I I feel like I know you even though I never met you
They seemed surprised that I mean most women you lose your baby thats it
But almighty God is
You never even get a chance to see them again
Thats true
Thats true
But thats what she had wrote me
She said she said she said it it is just awesome to her what is what is happening
yup
mhm
aw Ive heard of that
yup
So Francis
Did she say how she felt about what had happene
No
We we havent really talked about that but Im planning on making a trip down to visit her
Well what how does Akina fee
She shes u u very happy about it
Very ha
Well did she come home and say I saw her I look like her or wha
We we talked on the phone and you know she talked about her sisters and you know and things weve spent the night with her sisters
and things and its just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive down there and really caused Francis alotof stress
and Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know f because she just was acting like a total nigger child
uhoh
Hope the research didnt hear that
uhoh
wait wait Alita Im telling you nobody can handle her but you okay
And um but um
but she she was very concerned about me and everything and um because the child had told some some lies about me and about you
oh
oh
oh no
And about oh yeah mhm
oh goodness
yeah
That we were abusing that you know oh yeah she she did some eh and it was it was very very bad
My daughter inlaw Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday
Told her that she couldnt talk to Jasmine play with Jasmine because she hurt hur because she said she hurt Jasmines Jetta
you know and she said that if it wasnt for u Jas for Jetta you know Jasmines daddy wouldnt be oh shed oh man it was
aw
You know that has always been very scary to me even after
I said to Mark ohmygod Whats she going to say because I knew what she would do when if I took her somewhere
you know what she would say and I you know in these the climate of today
Yes
people saying something like that
That well you know thats and Francis was very concerned in reference to you know she was in school and things and Francis was w she was very very concerned
She said Alita she said this little girl has a serious problem
She wrote me a letter
mhm
you know about her needing alotof love alotof help and different things like this but you know youve heard the saying Im sure from your grandmother the fruits of your parents or the sins of your parents will be waged back at you
hm
you know and and I a again my husband said we were going to give it a month you know and said if he was even going to have to sheik pray over her you know for the Jen
hm
You know I mean were d you know and I think were still going to be doing that but I but I think hes at a point now where hes reserved us
of that um you know that she may end up going to t
oh well the thing is your whole life has been around her
mhm
more or less
mhm
mhm
I mean it is you know I mean absorbed
mhm
mhm
where is you know
mhm mm
And and and
you know
I mean
This is a lou this is a lousy eh I I I truly believe that Salem
I dont think you think shell be better with her mothe
I I have no idea
I I really have no idea
But
And um but you know the the the
i if this does happen and I do believe it may happen you know we will have an agreement she and I you know she will become the the legal guardian and that
uh you know Im I just want her to understand everything that has happened in the last several years
yeah
and things like that
She needs to be clear about that because this child wont be like the other two
eh eh
You know
Well she she said that she was
Andre said that she was
oh yeah
She was like her two daughters yeah
mhm
yeah
Th they had the same maybe just
problems and and different she hasnt been with her children for ten years
Her or her two girls
ah
And theyre twelve and
theyre no theyre nine and
thirteen or something like that
yup but shes shes working very hard
Shes trying to become a counselor in this drug program and things and
and she sounds like shes really trying hard
And I and I just believe its you know time
you know and who would have ever thought it though you know what I mea
Does she know that youre Musli
mhm
mhm
uhhuh
yup
yup
yup and
So th thats been my most interesting things in the last three weeks
oh thats some deep thats just too deep
yup
yup
mhm
yup
Been very very very heavy
From like mom said she said even if it was going to be in September she said the little things I can tolerate you know
if if that happens you know
But you know I always worried I said you know even after you left I said I just hope Arlita knows that I ch you know I tried my best you know and
Everybody has to keep them Selema everybody everybody
You know and I told her I said you know its a shame that you cant go no place and and I can get a go good report on you
you know and um and by her going to Francis and things and
and and Francis seeing for herself she was like whoa
Did had did Francis feel she had changed alo
oh yes
t oh yes
You know mhm mhm
a ah
um but but um but you know I feel very at peace about everything
uhhuh
I feel very at peace you know
Well its good to hear from Francis whos had alotof child
Yes
Over six hundred
oh
Over six hundred foster children
oh
Yes
mhm
You know she wouldve seen it all
She called mom to talk to mom lets see she bought
I met her in Albany
mhm
and she bought her
um
she caught that was on Friday last Friday she called mom last
she called mom Monday
And talked to mom for two hours
uhhuh
mm
She talked to mom for two hou here in Rochester
oh youre kidding
I was sick up in in Syracuse
She talked to mom
She must something mustve been on her mind
She was
She said she she told mom she said she was so concerned that this little girl was going to just get out here a cause I wasnt going to send back to the school the Muslim school
uhhuh
And she she was just really concerned about you know everything
mhm you know
What the possibilities of like
Sure
Sure
yep
mhm
mhm
Well you know or luck making a way and making it at ease for you to
Well you know why Allah is doing this
Im going to tell you why because my daughter inlaw is pregnant again
oh no
She said she was going to call you
☺She said she was going to call you☺
▔ah▔
I said well you call Selema and you tell her
I said oh and I dont have your number in my other phonebook I said
I said you just call her and tell her yup she sure is
▔oh my goodness▔
Goodness
Wait wait did they do it like the same thing they had to do last tim
No
You know wha
That same thing happened to Aliah
No
She had to take all that stuff the first time but then the second time
Nope
She
yup
yup
j j and and mom mom said I mean Jasmine was about two months old mom said oh goodness
eh I mean cause Jasmines not Jasmine is not nowhere like my other other little babies
She is not cuddly sweet
mm mm no w
She dont have time for that uh
She does not sit still or lay still for you to change her Pampers
This little girl moves
I mean sh you lay her down on the bed she gets up and she runs from well she doesnt run but she crawls real fast
And she has t aw
And youre like okay
And shes not a cuddly sweet little thing she and she climbs up the stairs Selema
Shes seven months old and shes climbing up the stairs
Climbs down the stairs and mom said so we found out when did we find out Barbara was pregnan
Last week we found out and mom told her
Mom said mom said Barbara m Jasmine is just moving shes moving out the way too
too quickly shes just she just was not a little sweet little cuddly
you know no way
uh lay there let me look at my grandmother kind of thing
No no way not at not one bit
oh oh what a Amway is probably going to have a rule though I could just
I just got back from the gym
oh good
uhhuh
Hows it goin
oh pretty well
It was really crowded today
yeah
I kindof assumed everyone would be at the shore
uhhuh
I was wrong
Well its the middle of the week or whatever so
But its the fourth of July
mm
So
yeah
People have to work tomorrow
Do you have to work tomorro
yeah
Did you have off yesterda
Yes
oh thats good
And I was paid too
oh
Is it paid toda
No
oh
But
yeah so the gyms going well
oh
But I still need to go more often
Well how often are you goin
Only four days a week
yeah
Got to get that up to five
mm
But I dont really like going with Anne Marie because she doesnt like to stay very long
Wh
I dont know
She kind of well unfortunately for some reason shes not like into cardio vascular
So when Im still riding the bike shes completely finished her weight lifting e routine
mhm
And like I havent even started mine
mhm
You know and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular
mhm
Its true
And that lifting the weights wont lose weight
mm mm
You wont lose it you know but
No I mean you might lose some but thats only when yo
For a woman who is lifting not that much I dont think
yeah
You would
I mean yeah I mean the only thing is just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time
yeah So I dont know maybe shell catch on soon
You do burn alotof calories an hour though lifting weights
uhhuh
But yeah I mean youre not going to I dont think youre going to lose that much
n and also lifting weights at Ballys means youre standing on line as for as much time as youre actually lifting
Really
yeah
Thats too bad
yeah
So its is it really overcrowde
Well I mean obviously since I work I cant get there until about six oclock at night which is when everyone else gets there
mhm
mhm
But I me Im sure for people who go in the daytime its probably dead
yeah
You know and I go um like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings its totally dead
mhm
So
But you know
the weeknights is pretty crazy
yeah
yeah
I found a gym yesterday here thats only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars twelve fifty
oh yeah
Wow
yeah
Its at the hospital nearby
Well thats a deal
yeah
yeah
So
uhhuh
I think tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up
Even Charlies going to joi

And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like two fried eggs
mhm
on toast with cheese
um
vegetarian sausages
um and like like fruit and ohmygod its just crazy
mhm

He was probably starving when he was here
yeah
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal
He likes Cocoa Pops
oh boy
Wow
Thats pretty crazy
yeah
Its all about being a blue collar man
I guess so
Theyre the ones who can eat all day
Reall
Well I mean he does work his ass off so
yeah
But
hm
hm
So I I assume its hard for you not to eat as much as he does
No
I learned quick fast in a hurry because Ive gained so much weight
oh reall
yeah
Actually in the first week I was here
mhm
I gained alot so
Well its hard to you know not eat when so when somebody else is eating
Well
Im figuring it out fast because
okay
with not working out and all
yeah
its pretty miserable my my crunch tape
mm
So I called this woman today
and um shes a dressmaker and were going to go see her next Thursday and talk about the her making my wedding dress
Slate green
yeah
uh
See that way I can have exactly what I want
Exactly
And its only like its only going to be about two hundred and fifty pounds which is about three hundred and fifty dollars
uhhuh
So its pretty good I mean comparatively
yeah
And itll be exactly what I want and itll look good on me you know like fit me
Sure
which is necessary at the moment because Im plump so
mhm
Now daddy got the invitations together for you today
uhhuh
And in it I put paint samples from Sherwin Williams
uhhuh
of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of
for the brides maids
uhhuh

Mom and dad wont have black
They dont want blac
Theyre really o opposed to it
di
Did you call Sharon and tell her tha
No
Could you do tha

Just say you know my parents are really opposed to black
yeah
They wont buy me a black dress
They won
Here wait
Let me look for my phonebook
No
Never mind
I can just open the the thing here
Now wait
What god we got so much furniture in this tiny apartment

But uh yeah apparently like at Lisa Manachis wedding like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were
Reall
Like everyone at mom and dads table
yeah
Who was at mom and dads tabl
Weirdo
All the just all of Lorraines friends
mhm
Who you know o of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before
mhm
But

Wha
How hideous they were
Adele wasnt at Lisa Manachis
Adele went to the mass wedding
She di
uhhuh
oh
And she wanted me to take her and I refused to go and she got mad
Reall
Well I said I said I I would not feel comfortable going
I was not invited
mhm
You know and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding thats a mass is open to everyone
I was like well thats fine but I dont I would not feel comfortable going
mhm
I think that would be obnoxious and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me
Right
To the
you know the other thing the reception
I wont I just wouldnt go
mm
So they had to take it down and drive her home
mm
So theyre always kind of pissy at me
mm
Thats okay
yeah
yeah
I mean Ive been thinking about it and the blacks not going to be so hot you know but
mhm
yeah
Apparently they were also carrying lillies
which is kind of goofy
yeah
Well I guess she did that to because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the
symbol of the virgin Mary
mhm
White lillie
White lillies and black dresses
mm my goodness
Thats funny
yeah
yeah
Adele was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral and she had to keep reminding herself
mm
So now did you do you think you think my weddings going to be pretty tasteful righ
But
oh yeah
Now what about the matchbook
Well Ill work on it
I still think about the matchbooks
yeah
Ill Ill tell dad that you still think about the
Don I havent forgotten those and theyll still be enough time when I come home for me to order those
yeah
Ill have remind him of that little
item
yeah
huh how fun You know I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day
and shes telling me about you know her sisters wedding
And at her sisters wedding they uh they provided champagne and beer
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it
mhm
yeah
thats fo f thats actually kind of common but its
oh it is
its pretty declasse
Well I kind of thou I mean of course I didnt say anything to her
yeah
You know I said w as far as I knew we werent charging people
yeah
Now
But uh yeah dads already Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day
And there were having a sale
on the wine dad wanted
Are you talking to m
Of course Im talking to you
I can hardly hear you
oh
I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something
Im talking to you
oh yeah
No dad told me that
oh he did tell you
Its all Chilean
yeah
yeah
Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or
mm
something like that
I dont know
mm
The Theres a pretty good sale so
mm
So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale
An do you know if Jack called Spencer ye
I told him this morning to do it this this week
uhhuh
And he kind of he just keeps forgetting
yeah
But o
Hows he doin
Much better
yea
yeah
Hes of hes often chipper
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen
Pe
ohmygod
Is that because hes not sleeping and
Well because he couldnt breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom
oh
So I think its time to give all the cats a bath
mm
yeah and the you should do that
I know
Its a two person job though
Ill have to get somebody to help me
mm
yeah
hm
hu
What pric
uh free
Free
which is even better yes
Wow
mhm
But what about yo
uh then Ill work on me
uh because see if I dont
I if I dont get back like next week its no big deal
I could just stay here
So its not important for me
Right
You se
So the main thing is to get your your deal
So you might not come back her
Right
Got you
See Im only be there for like three or four days
Right
So I mean if its going to cost me an arm and a leg its cheaper if I just stay here
Right
So you dont need
Because I dont have to do anything but work that day so
Right
Well what happens to your work the
Well I just wont do it
But I mean if I have to pay you know a thousand dollars its not
expeditious to make a thousand and
Thats a big word
Those crosswords are making you use big words
pay a thousand
Is that what it i
Getting bette
uhhuh
mhm hm
Thats the purpose
uhhuh
Increase your word power
mhm
So
Well
you know that would that would be the
the thing
I mean
theres no way Im sure youre not going to get back
you know within a day or two of the time
You know because therere eighteen hundred flights that
that go back
Im not on American
On American
On American
They go from London
oh this is a flight to Londo
Right
I see
Right
And then just get the connecting flight
Can you get me a connecting fligh
Well that shouldnt be a problem
Susan said theres no interEurope flights
Right
Right
No I can go down to the place here and
Sure
Sure
uh nothings uh possible with Susan
No everybody who doesnt have a ticket a month ago is not going to fly for the rest of the year
So you dont want a ticket to Milan for nine hundred dollar
Well again thats the point
I mean if its going to cost that
uh
Its easier for me just to get yours than
not do one
okay
You se
mhm
Im eating a banana excuse me
It just
I see
You know it just depends on if you would
just like the
you know stand by thats the
Well
You know to have a sh you know
And Id have to stand by in London by myself
uhhuh
Like a big girl yes
Yes Exactly
but exactly
Thats the thats the thing
You know we just pick a
Amazing
just pick a day you know like probably the Tuesday
like the first of August
would be the best time
Right
um Mondays sometimes people coming back but uh you know nobody leaves on Tuesdays
Well do you think it would be better to come like on that Friday the twenty first and then Id be closer to the middle of August anyway
uh well I mean thats some
Can we do tha
mm thats something you could do
uh you know the other thing is
Because if youre not coming anyways then
Right
I dont have to fly with you so I could just come that Friday
Right
Well the other thing is is that you could just stay longer
Right
Exactly
Get a short flight
Just stay longer
Well yeah but
mhm
Maybe you came like the twenty first uh
It would be uh a little over three weeks instead of
Right
mhm
I think I should go back to work but I think it would be better if I came on the twenty first that way then
uhhuh
If you can change it
Well I can probably change it
Because that way
oh
Ill be closer to the middle of August and
hopefully if theres when the problems arise with David Steel Im not going to even say if
um
I can resolve it from here and not have it ruin my vacation
uhhuh
Right
oh thats true
You know Id rather not have to be doing that craziness and Id still be there for B B King and Etta James
duh duh buh buh duh duh
They uh they ther
Wha
What day are they t her
Hold on
You dont have the paper
oh
Well I no I got it
I g
uh theyre here theyre here the twenty third so yeah youd get here the twenty second
It is true
um
You know and if they didnt have room on the twenty first I could come the twentieth just a few days by myself a few days
uhhuh
Right
Right
okay
um
Where was that paper by the wa
Which pape
The paper that
I copied it for you and gave it to you

The important thing is that we have it
I want to be able to say I told you so
No
No

Yes
Youre just not happy to have it
You have to get some got to get some justice

Right
Everybody will have the stuff by then
yeah
That wont be a problem
mhm
Wont be a problem
um
The sixteenth youd have to stay over in Boston anyway
uh if you did that
But again thats not see I that one wasnt even available the last time I called
Right
they said call because people do cancel
Right
And so you know during the time we just call
on a daily basis just
Sure
changing
Thats groovy
But its not a problem
Im excited
The only problem will be the ticket to get to London
But Ill see if we can get a one way
and then buy another one way going back
Wheres this ticket this ticket is to Mila
uh no get it to Nice from London to Nice
Right
Right
No
I mean coming when I leave L A the where do I fly t
Londo
London
mhm yeah
And then Ill have to take a boat because theres no no interEuropes according to Susan
ah
Right
Exactly
All the people in Europe are paralyzed
yep
No
Its its great
Well let me know
uh no
Ill go ahead and do it
okay
And Ill go and talk to the person here cause they get cheap tickets
okay
from London to Nice and stuff
Is Neil still ther
uh yep
yep
yep
Exactly
Hes never going home
uh lets see Saturday
Saturday
Saturday we went out to dinner with uh Georgio
the other night
uhhuh
And
had a really good meal
Well go there again when you come
okay
Its really good restaurant
They were people who went to the jazz festival with me last year
They own the restaurant
oh sure
So theyll probably want to go with us this year
Thats fine
Nice people
Cool
Cool
Cool
Cool yes yes
So have any of your things close
No
Nothing
Nothing
I just had a nice dream though that David
is was just fine
uhhuh
That he got his money in today like hes supposed to
Right
That was a dream
So he still hasnt made any inroad
uh uh
Nothing hu
Hes having trouble closing his station
uhhuh
It may not happen
ohgod
If that doesnt happen hell commit suicide
The statio
Right
If he doesnt get the station
Probably
Hell commit suicide
Hell be in bad shape
mhm
and then thats because everybody involved will get sued
What do you mea
Everybody involve
Does that mean Shirl Cla
Probably
Wh
I dont think they can but I think theyll try
You know how people are
About the fall one you mea
yeah
yeah
trying to figure out
Well I told
I told him too that Ill mention to him again
on Monday but
he doesnt h hes not well of coarse MisterOharshi
is not always
prompt in his answer either but
but maybe MisterFurobiashi too will
Well I was just wondering maybe I should should I just pick a date and and
say Im coming
yeah because I think you know at first we were talking about that
trying to work it in with the festival but I dont think its going to be good because of the fact
Right
that we
f foreign teachers many of us want to go down to that
Sure
which is right after you know which well leave like on the Friday night
uh the third and then be down for the fourth and fifth
mhm
So so I think probably just work it in to your
general scheduling you know like youve done before and not bother hit it on that weekend
We
yeah
okay
Well Im um what I was trying to figure
I asked some of the students here whether they thought it was better to arri to be there before or after the fall festival and they said after
uhhuh
Do you agre
Yes
Well mainly because there are
especially if its just the few days before thats when the students finally get down to preparing for the festival and so those days are really pretty
yeah
pretty busy
And so after the festival its uh theyre freer alot freer so if you could make it after that weekend
What about just Im looking at the calendar trying to figure what about say on November
say if I were there November n
either come in on the ninth or you know the evening of the eighth from wherever I probably will already finish the other countries
uhhuh
Maybe make it make Japan the last place
Last yeah
uhhuh
um come in on the either the eighth or ninth and then leave there on Saturday the eleventh
How are what are those days do you know what those days might be lik
Would those be good day
Eighth or eighth and nint
n or ninth and tenth
uh ni ninth is yes obviously we have our our special chapel
that week but thats just second period its just that there are theres there are no classes second period
and the students have this special chapel but but even you know evenings for a meeting or something would be fine
Id like to meet with the parents again that seemed to be
so well received uh last time
mhm
um and weve got of coarse some more parents
yeah its
um and now were getting a few graduates going back
uhhuh
that graduated this year
yeah
So uh you know its the beginning of a
much
bigger
y y y you would come in on the ninth the
group
Either that or say the at late afternoon or the evening of the eighth
okay
We have a
You know I I havent
English department faculty meeting on the eighth but
And that goes until what tim
Well it d they dont start until five ten
oh okay
Five ten till
So it would be better to come in on like the morning of the ninth
or like before noon on the nint
yeah
Or around noon or whatever
yeah it w
yeah
it would be okay
oh
uh okay
Put down A M and then leave Saturday um sometime
uhhuh
Whenever
Because Ive been trying to put this together but I didnt know how to to organize it
I really wanted to organize it
yeah
uh you know J C J C has been the
kingpin of this
uh group
Now MisterFurobiashi the last time I did hear from t or no I guess it was one of the girls that a graduate that was just over there
and came back and she said when she talked to him
that he indicated there were not many interested in studying in the U S because they were a a not very motivated group
yeah
This the present check at your students yeah
Now i m my first y the first year we have about seventeen or eighteen in the study abroad class
Great
In the first year so a and the and this the first year bunch are different I mean they
oh
they seemed to be more motivated so it c its true that Im not sure how many there will be in the second although there are two second year students in the class this year
mhm
So uh
but I dont know where I Im not I havent talked to them yet to see where they would be
Now theyre interested or just wha
what theyre thinking about
mhm
um well you can can uh
talk with them and see if theyre
uh whether theyre interested in studying actually studying abroad or planning on it or anything then well know a little better
uhuh
whether I need to have two days there
yeah
or I could fly in in the morning and out the next morning or you know what would what would work best
mhm
cause I dont want to I dont want to wear out my welcome
Excuse me for coughing on this
Well no thats okay
My goodness
That was a native speakers cough
oh
And uh you know its not that he cant
Hes got the smarts
yeah
Hes just been a little bit unmotivated
mhm
uh June is doing much better
yeah
uh she had uh i it was a hard start
She kept g falling asleep in class
You cant do that in an American classroom
mhm
yeah
And uh you know she was trying to memorize the whole book
and were saying no youve got to use the book you know youve got to use the vocabulary
We dont care if you memorize it
We dont care if you make mistakes
mhm
Youve just got to try to use it
She was looking for perfection
mhm
Shes relaxing a little bit and um is coming along Hiroki unfortunately hes doing hes you know minimal
mhm
Hes doing the minimal
But there is another Japanese girl in his class who didnt come through J C J C shes a high school graduate
mhm
and is very unmotivated very poor attitude i attitude and is just
um really resistant
Im not quite sure why shes here you know
uhhuh
and Hiroki has appointed himself as her protector
oh dear
and consequently shes failing
mm
and she should be by her testing she should be the top student in the class
oh
she could be easily
but shes just
you know just
puts on the air that shes not interested and
mhm
we had some knock down drag outs with her
mm
Shes just really immature the other Japanese girls say oh shes just
you know i its immaturity
mhm
But uh because he
just
identifies with her
mhm
you know he is not performing to where he could perform or should perform
mhm
And so when shes not around he does better
uh b you know not great but better
mm
So he and its real interesting you know I dont know at what point I will call up his cousin you know his aunt and uncle live here
yeah I know mhm
in town
and uh this has got to be a little bit of a problem because his cousin is a gal
she just passed the bar exam and has set up her own law practice
oh brother
alotof people who come from two different religio religions go there
oh yeah
yeah okay
yeah
mhm hm
So it was wonderful and
And then what was the um reception lik
Well we went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes and
uhhuh
we played softball and uh volleyball and four square and had dancing and m music and great food and
Wow that sounds like alotof fun
It was
Wow
It sounds like it was great
yeah everybody alotof people told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to and thats I guess the highest compliment you can get
Wow
So and where did you guys go on a honeymoo
We went on a honeymoon to this island off the coast of Puerto Rico
oh god
In the Carribean
But i the hardest part was getting there
I mean we had to take three planes to get there
But the
We got this book from my mom about the Carribean
And um
Id always wanted to go to the Carribean
So we just decided okay well go
We only went for five days
It was pretty short but um
uhhuh
The place was totally laid back
It was this old plantation house that um had
this twenty four rooms
And and they said in the book like you wont be able to tell the guests from the staff
And
mhm
um it it was really really cool
And they have you know i mismatched sheets and stuff
It wasnt fancy at all but it was really cheap
And
uhhuh
They just had the bar open all the time
You could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guest ticket
And
ohmygod
They picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast and stuff
It was great
Wow it sounds idyllic
It was really tiny so the island is only ten miles long
uhhuh
um
But it was it was good cause i you know everybody speaks English and and yet its still pretty exotic you know
uhhuh
We went snorkeling
And it wa
God it sounds great
Thats something I really regret is that Norm and I didnt have a honeymoon
yeah well you should go on one anyway
yes
yeah we were planning on going one on one one of these days but I dont know now whats going to happen
Well youll just have to take your kid
I know I think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people were going on our honeymoon
How big are yo
um well actually Ive only gained four pounds
uhhuh
But is it showin
Which is not alot for you know for how far I am but Im Im definitely pregnant
yeah
I mean I have all of the
You know I need to give myself the extra support when I get up
And
uhhuh
You know like you know how when youre
You know like when I get up like you know like how wide you put your feet apart when you get u
uhhuh
Well I have to probably put my feet like five inches further apart and kind of hoist myself up sortof like
uhhuh
So
Which is pretty funny
yeah Im definitely pregnant
But Im not huge by any means
But i y what are you five and a half months no
yeah
So its its just starting to get into the part where you start to show
And
uhhuh
start to get big and the whole bit
But its weird
Like you go like um
like Im Im not fatter in anywhere
uhhuh
Except my stomach
I mean it honestly looks like I swallowed
I mean its really weird
Like
I can see
You can s Ive never really like been up close to a pregnant woman before but you know like Ive seen them at the gym and stuff like that but never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that I could like actually look at her
uhhuh
But you can see the line of your uterus
You can see in your stomach where it is
Its like this big circle
and it sticks out in that big circle
And its filling up with a
yeah
thing
An alien presence
Thats totally what it feels like
Really
Does it move around ye
oh yeah
He he he kicks alot
I dont I dont know that its a he but I call him he
He kicks alot
Hes been kicking for about five weeks now
huh
But um he just started this week
He started rolling that I can feel
I mean they roll the whole time but now I can feel him rolling and its totally bizarre
Its
Do you have a name for it I mean like a you know a joke name that you call i
Like
No
Ive heard some really good ones
But
The only one that I came up with was Thumper cause he just kicks so much
Hes really an active baby
Thumper
Well thats good
yeah
Healthy
Well also the monster child is the other thing I call him
The monster child Rosemarys baby
I know
Well um
Because he kicks so much its really you know its really annoying
I mean
Does it wake you u
No he hasnt woken me up yet but if I wake up in the middle of the night he is he does kick and so you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up
What if its a gir
Well its probably not a girl because in our family its o if you go on both sides of our family and you look at all our first cousins and everything its like seventy five percent male
huh
But it might be a girl
I was positive it was a girl
Like the first three months I was absolutely positive it was a girl
And then I changed my mind an
now she is a boy
Well thatll be a surprise then
yeah yeah
I dont know
Are you going to ask them not to tell you if you had
oh were not having an ultrasound
uhhuh
Because its really like
We went and looked up all this research
Theres all this stuff
Youll see when you get pregnant
And
If if you want to know just send me email
Because I looked up a bunch of stuff but theres all this research like on theres all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now
Its not just amnio its like other stuff too
uhhuh
And then theres also um
you know the the uh the ultrasound
But in fact like
if you look at the l the la the latest research on ultrasound its like they really dont know
Like they assume that its safe because you know theyve had it for twenty years right
And nothing has happene
They never
Ye well they dont know
Theyve never really done any big studies on it or anything
But the but if youre a normal low like theres reasons to have an ultrasound
And if you have to have an ultrasound then its a really good diagnostic tool righ
Right
But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine its not a good diagnostic tool at all
Like
is they find as many um false positives as they do false negatives
For for spinabifida and stuf
Well the only thing they can really check they can check the heart
uhhuh
And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain
And then they can do like
yeah
But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has um
ah
Defects of various kinds
Like Downs Syndrome
Like sometimes y But thats not really very good
Like amnio is the only sure way to find out
Right
But it could give you like some indications that the baby might have Downs or something
But its really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancies
So
yeah
I didnt bother getting one
yeah good
Im sure everything will be fine
oh yeah
And if its not its like you know youre going to have to deal with it anyway
Well what are you going to do I mean if its not like and we didnt do any of the testing because like
I Ive met like three people since I got pregnant where the baby had Downs right
They found out the baby had Downs
And they aborted it
They had well its not called abortion its called termina
Termination thats right
And I jus I just couldnt have done that
I just
We talked about it a little bit you know what I mean
Like
obviously I dont want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that
But
But if it does youll deal with it
I just could not have done that
So it wasnt worth doing the prenatal testing
Because you know
If youre not going to abort anyway then theres no reason to have it
yeah
I mean there are like some there are some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life
Right
But then I figured well Ill just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then the baby will die when its born
You know
If its like that
yeah
yeah we had this friend
This is not supposed to scare you its just because it was on the topic
But um but the baby died at like eight and a half months
mm
I know
I read so many of those stories
They just freak me out
You know
And of course they make you have give birth anyway
You know you cant have an
You have to
I mean what are
I mean thats how you have an abortion is you give birth you kn
yeah
And its dead you know its dead
And its a hassle you know
And youve got to go through all that pain knowing the babys not even alive anyway
yeah
But you know
Shes a pregnant again
You know sh theyre fine
And what happened to the bab
Do they kno
They got over it
I think it got either strangled by its cord or some kind of
yeah thats what they g They always say that g
They say that but
cord accident
Its an it was an accident
Its like they dont know
yeah you know
Its like something happened
Or or maybe it
it went into
oxygen deficiency or something
Like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time
yeah
mhm
and so she didnt even know it until the next morning
And
It was something like that
Wow
That is so scary
But obviously you know y when you have a baby
for the rest of its life and your life you have to worry that it might die you know or something will happen to it
oh I know it is so scary
Its awful
Thats got to be the worst thing
Well anyhow did you get to meet your nephew at your
I did
The baby Jack is huge
at the wedding
Hes hes four months and hes like eighteen pounds
ohmygod
The kid is ado But its all breast milk
Thats huge
Thats like the size of a two year old isnt it
Hes huge
Hes hes the shape of a of a small ch baby but you know hes big Hes heavy
oh you better hope that that doesnt run in the family
How big was he when he was born
Well
He was normal size when he was born
Like eight and a half pounds
ok
okay
yeah
But um my brothe you know my uncle is like six foot four and my brother is big and on Gaelins side of the family theres big people too
So I mean he could just be a big boy
Thats I mean eighteen pounds
That is humongous
Eighteen pounds from breast milk alone in four months
ohmygod
And yet hes small
You know he doesnt l look that huge
Hes not very long or anything hes just
uhhuh
And hes not chub Hes chubby but hes
He just weighs
Hes hefty
yup yeah well they dont you know they just tell you feed on demand
I mean if they want to eat that much you let them eat that much
and and hes healthy and all so you know shes just like oh well
uhhuh
uhhuh
And do they seem happy and
um I know Cynthia through Rach
oh so she yeah so she is
and so its kind of like a roundabout thing and I we dont talk that much I see her occasionally we all go out
oh yeah
um but not all that much Im with Rachel constantly so its funny that I dont see her more actually
yeah
but yeah
well now shes with Kurth
yeah constantly
Im so happy for her though hes such a nice guy
he is nice and theyre good together
yeah
and now theyre going up for the wedding arent they
yeah uhhuh
yeah because she was trying to get me to go with them and I was like
this was before I even knew about the Spain thing and I was like I dont know I want to go so bad
and I said but I dont have a date and then shes like go with us
yeah
so then I was thinking about it and then when I got this offer to go to Madrid I was like
oh Id much rather go visit them in
Spain then I can see all the wedding pictures
yes
I thought that would be great
so when are you going
I think I might go Thanksgiving that week
uhhuh and youre just staying for one week
yeah
okay
and Im going to take I think Im going to take some resumes around
yeah really
I miss it so much
do you
do you miss it now
no not at all
You dont
No
I guess you lived there long enough to get it all out of your system
yeah well now get this we might go to live in Switzerland
oh really
yeah because theyve made him a job offer there and at first hes thinking nah he wasnt going to take it but now hes like
well its a really good offer and a good experience and then
maybe he could get in his foot in the door with because theyve united with A T T
uhhuh
and then you know the Swiss phone company whatever and
telefonika
so hes thinking well that would hed get his foot in the door with A T T so it w
would might be easier to come back here later
right
and at first I thought oh yeah it would be nice to go to Switzerland its really pretty its green not like Spain and
right
you know we could learn German but
thats true
I dont know but now with all the wedding its all hectic and everything now I dont want to go its
like no not another problem not another move
yeah youd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning
right yeah
thats true when would he be going
I dont know
um
be going
he said as soon as possible like October
ohmygod
I know
then you wouldnt even be there
I know but
oh my goodness
I dont think were going I hope not I mean Id like it under other circumstances but
right is that what he eventually wants to get back to the States
yeah uhhuh yeah
well thats good thats good for you because then you know that it isnt a permanent thing that youll be going to Spain
alright well we dont know hopefully its not
yeah yeah
so
thats funny that youre still sick of it that makes me laugh because I miss it so much
I think I just miss the freedom and the fun because Im so bored
yeah and probably when you were there yeah you were there because you wanted to be you werent w and you were working because you wanted to work there not because you had to like
yeah but its just
you have to work
I just
things I just hate everything
well not really I mean its not that bad Im working and
my job is okay I use my Spanish and stuff but its just
well thats cool
I dont know
I hate my job so much ohmygod I cant wait like next well my last day is Thursday but
oh c

well do you need the extra time though
yeah
because its coming up fast
you know oh theyre just coming on Saturday next Saturday
oh my goodness
yeah week from tomorrow
oh thatll be fun
or a week from whenever
and have you heard from Ellen and Reuben are they going up
she wasnt sure because well she said ei either
well she said she would definitely come or at least try to come but Reuben might not because theyre going to Spain first
and then theyre coming back here so then they thought maybe theyd come directly from
Spain here but they werent sure and then you know it costs extra money
so she wasnt sure what she was doing or how she was going to do it
yeah
but I think shes definitely going to come
oh thats good
as long as they can swing it yeah but I dont know if theyll
and Erica I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her
yeah but he was here I think around
a long time ago
yeah Christmas time and supposedly he was coming back in August but I dont know because I heard
well I heard it from Alberto who heard it from Sanju who heard it from Caroline
ohgod
so who knows if its true or not but that yeah like things werent going that great with them
oh
so I dont know
but shell be up for the wedding right
I dont know because I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasnt coming because she had to work or something on Friday
oh
but I dont know I dont know if any of thats true or not so
oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse
I know
then you wonder oh my goodness
well my friends I have two friends from France coming
oh thats good
yeah
wow and is his family coming from Spain
just his two sisters
well thats good
yeah
thats good do they speak English
no not really
oh good thatll be fun
and they dont they dont really want to come either
oh God
but thats okay
oh I
I dont really want them to come either
yeah oh yeah thats right because you didnt get along well with his family
yeah theyre not very nice well his cousins and everything seems really nice and theyve written back letters and stuff and they seem all
excited to meet me and theyre like we cant wait to meet our new cousin and stuff like that so
oh
well thats neat
yeah
and then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or what are your plans
Im just going to not work for a while and
thats a good idea
see what happens yeah
oh goodness
yeah
you have alot to do
I know and Ive got to ship all this stuff over there weve taken out a loan
I can imagine because how else would you get everything
I know
oh my goodness
what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you
it is yeah but then I have a friend here who shes married and she has three little kids and shes moving to Seattle and shes going to start studying
oh my goodness
and her husband is just quitting hes going to quit his job here and like look when he once he gets out there so
at least shes kind of going through the same thing
exactly
so yeah I dont feel so alone
yeah I was thinking about actually doing a masters in Madrid
oh really
and working like at working like at a T G I Fridays or someplace where I know theyd hire me
oh right
and then just working on a masters during the day and working at night
who would you go with like N Y U or Middlebury
I dont know Im trying to find an American university that has masters programs
N Y U has one for one year
and I
Spanish Amigamato
I get a masters in one yea
yeah
yeah
yeah
in Madrid
yep
the whole year
yeah and then
I dont have to study at all in the States
no uhuh
ohmygod Spanish Marcelene thankyou Im going to write that down
yeah and then Middlebury College you know in they have
uhhuh
you have to go for one summer to but its just the summer and then you do one year in Madrid and you get a masters
wow okay N Y U and what was the o Middlebury
yeah
Im going to go research them at Wash U this weekend then because
Im just bored I dont know if its just b because Im single and bored and theres like nobody in the midwest whos twenty eight single
no
and and straight
oh
no
most of my friends are single I was just saying like
I mean Im not the first one to get married at all but still Im still in like that first bunch
oh really
yeah
oh my wave must have struck early then because everybody I know is married or getting married and Im so jealous
oh really
in fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend exboyfriend I dont know what he is but were always together
about your wedding and I was like Im so excited
hes going to be out of town or else Id make him go and wed go but
I was like Im just so excited for her I said oh shes so lucky and then theyre going to go live in
Spain and blah and hes just like okay okay Im sick of your friends
thats all I talk about Im just so happy for everybody
but then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and Im like stuck
oh but itll be worth the wait believe me I know how you feel
its horrid
I know
and you dont know what to do and like I cant seem to adjust to the family thing
yeah th well theres nothing you really can do
I know
just when you least suspect it thats when itll happen
yeah thats true well believe me I havent been looking or waiting Im like
now tell me about this guy because I know I remember now that you told me something about him
its the same one believe it or not
yeah
he was supposed to actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it until October
oh really
yeah hes in Korea right now for three weeks and then hes in Spain for two weeks
so whats he doing in in Missouri
he works for Arthur Andersen
oh oh thats right okay
in Madrid and they sent him yeah and so hes on loan or whatever
but he says wimpy things dont you hate when guys say like
oh if things if if we if things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with
oh yeah but
oh thats such a wimp thing to say
yup
because if they really wanted to spend the rest of their lives with you they would make things different
right exactly
and I just looked at him and I thought you know y you guys suck
so whats wr whats wrong now with your relationship according to him
just the fact that w hes leaving and Im not going to answer the other line because
oh
Im on long distance just because he said well in October Im going back to Spain first it was July and then he extended it
and I saw his list of reasons why hed extend and I was number one
oh really
and Im like oh thats good
yeah
but then hes like oh its just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much
uhhuh
that he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine
oh right
but he doesnt realize that we live different lives
right
for me
youre willing to leave
its like its no big deal because
at the drop of a hat yeah
I know its like just say the word and Im gone
but I wont go back to Spain for a guy unless its a sure thing because thats ridiculous
yeah well you did that already right
yeah
I did that once
I dont want to do that again so I dont know
well but maybe if you go in November hell see you know
yeah itll be different itll be different to be over there and see him
so where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid
yeah he lives well he lives by AvenidodeAmerica
oh okay
he lives like toward the airport
uhhuh
which is good and his dad works at a bank his mother is French
oh really
yeah she
does he speak French
Yes he does fluently
And guess who called here last night looking for your addres
Wh
AdamHolnick
AdamHolnic
Wh
Well mommy and I were sea seated with his mother Im sure this is why
mhm
At Lisas wedding
uhhuh
and yeah we were just talking about you
mhm
and she said that she was sure Adam would love to get in touch with you well guess what he does
oh okay I mean hes a nice guy and all
uhhuh
Does he know that I live all the way here no
well he well he does now since Alex gave him your address
oh okay
oh thats funny
oh okay and
hm
um there are other things I need to tell you
I was talking to Spencer
uhhuh
and he needs to know
a whether therell be more than one set up or just one set up
just one
now the set up would be you know everybody being photographed in the same place
yeah I know yeah just one
one
okay and then he needs to kno
but just tell him I want black velvet
hu
I want black velvet
okay
backdrop and thats thats it really
okay
okay
and then
uh he needs to know how many different shots you anticipate
yeah
I have to think about that
okay okay
well
I told him how many rolls I wanted
uhhuh
um did he I told him I wanted ten two and a quarter
okay okay
but I think it might actually have to be more than ten
mhm
Well I mean obviously you know the expenses go up the more he has to shoot
You know what I mea
yeah yeah
Like theres a relationship between the number of rolls he shoots and the cost of the whole
oh yeah
thing
no I know well yeah because he has to take it to a place and then got a contact all of them and
right
stuff like that
right right Well will all of it be black and whit
um
yes
yes alright
and if its not going to cost too much Id like to buy
one of the rolls whichever roll is the nicest one
uhhuh
Id like to buy that roll
uhhuh
okay
okay
okay so youll have to think about how many different shots there would be
like people setups
mhm
yeah
okay
and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itsel
I dont think so
what do you think
okay
I think its tacky
yeah
no I dont think it either
okay
mommy never no mommy and I did not have any at all
no
I think its just going to its going to be hard enough and
yeah right and this g
I I dont need that
right and because in that environment I dont I think youre right on that I think it would be awkward
mhm
um and so I think thats better actually so if yo if you know this way he could
just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself
mhm
and what I would like to do
which you know I heard about people doing elsewhere for the color ones during the meal
hm
is you know put some of those disposable cameras on some tables and let you know
mhm mhm
mhm
because then Ill Ill be sure to get pictures from my friends and stuff
mhm mhm
yeah thats good
thats good everything
What do you think of tha
yeah thats fine
okay
yeah I think thats fine
mhm
okay well I told him I would get back to him
How many rolls did you tell hi
I told him ten two and a quarter but
okay
its going to I think its going to have to be more than that
uhhuh
like twelve to fifteen
uhhuh
yeah
okay
well anyway what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people poses
mhm
yeah
no I do
uhhuh
because I mean you know he he ah he has to allot enou enough time in order to accomplish all of that
mhm
you know its not as if and I mean I know what its like at Drexel you know when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken
mhm
uh it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know and you have to take several shots of each grouping and
mhm
all of that can take a considerable amount of time
yeah
yeah Ill Ill um Ill Ill think about all that
yeah okay and
yeah Im also going to have a a list of stuff of music that I want the D J to play
yeah okay well you know any time you f you could probably let them know that when you come back here
you think so
I would think so
okay
I can call him and ask him ah but I but I think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself
okay
but anyway well find out about that
mm
I um i you know the invitations have gone out along with all of the information on travel in Philadelphia I sent a map
mhm
mhm
lots of people can see how to get to the Art Alliance you know
oh thats nice dad
uh for all the people out of from out of town
uhhuh
and then I also sent them information on hotels It turns out that the Barclay
okay
is actually the
right next door
its actually the best deal because theyll give me the best deal
oh really wait hold on let me get a pen
to write this down
uhhuh
okay
I mean the Barclay which is right across the street will
Isnt it its right next door right
yeah right directly across the street
okay
um is um I think its ninety nine dollars
for a double and eighty nine dollars for a single is that what it is Ale
yeah its eighty nine for a single and ninety nine for a double
okay did you check on triples or no
ah no I didnt but I could do that easily
okay
uh I bic
and at that thats a deal thats not
yeah thats not the regular price the regular price is a hundred and twenty
the regular rat
okay so were taking twenty dollars of
yeah theyre taking twenty dollars off
okay
at the Holiday Inn is actually the same price
the Holiday Inn
man that sounded cr yucky
was
area
was ninety nine dollars
for a double without a continental breakfast and a hundred and fourteen dollars with the continental breakfast I mean thats for two
m
so at at the Barclay do you get breakfas
no no thats the room
okay
okay
the room cost is that
okay
okay
mhm
but I mean you know as perf as well as I do that all you if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to Diner On The Square two blocks away
yeah
exactly
and so um you know in that area of Penn you can actually eat quite expens inexpensively
mhm
uh because there are alotof of Asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks
mhm
and so you know its a its a it
no I mean theres Italian restaurants right around there too you know
yeah
I mean there are lots of places where people could eat
relatively inexpensively around the Barclay
yeah
um and so that actually turned out to be the best deal
okay
uh that could be arranged and so I you know sent a written
statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know what their options are
okay
and they all have the map as well
okay
okay
so all of that is working out quite nicely
okay
um as it turns out the I think the bed and breakfast is cheaper that that
okay well I can find out about that I didnt do that yet
yeah did did you I should I give you the name of i
The Reserve
Reserve
yeah no I didnt do that one yet
okay
uh but I could do that and let you know
yeah could you ask about whether theyll do triples there
uhhuh
and rooms with a bathroo
uhhuh
okay
Patrolis mother and grandmothers are going to be you know

uh
you want to hear the weirdest thin
uhhuh
okay today I came out of the British Museum
and its just packed you know with tourists
yes
whatever and lots of Italians
uhhuh
and I went out around the corner and made a
call home and as I was standing in the phone booth there was this group of
pretty
fairly like like mid teen age
year kids walking by
yeah
one of them was just staring at me
and dont tell me
okay you cou you c
the young woman the in the house where you stayed in Florence
yes
ohmygod
Isnt that bizarr
and you talked to he
I I was staring at her then I went out and I couldnt remember where Id seen her before
uhhuh
and
then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these Italian kids
yeah
yeah
and she just kept staring at me and then as I got close she kind of like
yeah
walked around
like behind one of her friends or something like she was nervous or s something
right right right
and Im thinking this is just too weird and I didnt recognize it as her
right
and then I walk past the bus
and I turn around and I just looked at her
uhhuh
and then I just started smiling and she started smiling and so I kind of knew it was her and everything but
uhhuh uhhuh
but uh isnt it craz
yeah what was her name Kiar
Kiara

yeah
I thought huh
It is a small world

well it was like a school group or something because it was all kids you know like
yeah yeah
huh yeah right
fifteen sixteen years old

uhhuh
okay now if youre getting married on saturday the ninth
the latest date on which you can apply for the license is the preceding monday
uhhuh
the preceding Monday
um but although they solicit theyre trying to solicit more throughout the throughout the globe instead of just Japan
mhm
although theyve had most interest in Japan

And I really missed people

Coming here w the only person that really knew and understood my circumstances was Tom

Its called total phone
oh here it is Priority Party Call
Party call
Party calls
total phone
You have total phone
I have
Great
What should we talk abou
Well I dont know
Tell me whats going on in America
I havent seen the news in ages
Reall
You did d
In the American news I mean I know whats going on in Russia but
yeah
Well lets see
Whats going o
uh
You want me to just give you some headline
yeah
Give me some headlines
Whats Clinton up t
up
yeah
I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh his statement concerning affirmative action
uhhuh
And and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of
you know of making al allowances strictly based on race
but at the same time the analysis in the news
shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that
Clinton just came out and said that he doesnt believe in quota systems
and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action
is necessary to move you know black Americans
forward and to give them the opportunities that theyve been denied
So hes trying to k kind of walking a tight rope
You know what Im sayin
Right
In other words l
Hes trying to please everybody
yeah
Lets see if we can make everybody happy
I think that hes
Then he just ends up making nobody happy
I think youre right Because you know affirmative action is really under attack in the United States on
from many different quarters right now
And and its a big
its a big issue because its supposed to be a gender I mean not a gender a race
uh color blind were supposed to be race color blind and yet its like contractors
that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than
the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever
And its really you know
Right
And then then so theyre taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and all of this so its
Wow
Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in Georgia
violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race
There was you know a new
What did they do i They were doing it because they were trying to make it more e like they were trying to make it less segregate
They were trying to make the district majority black Americans so therefore they drew it all the way across the state
You see what Im sayin
oh right
uhhuh
a a very narrow district and it created a majority black district which then elected
a a black representative and then it was challenged because it said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to ensure that it was
majority black and thats not
right
you know
Hell
Im here
okay Anyway
Im mulling all this over
yeah
I mean its it
So its interesting because today we had a discussion with students about
because were doing a pre departure orientation so we were we had our hot topics
discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about like political correctness
and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment feminism and
just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia
So that was one of the things kind of like that
But I have Im not really up on what the attitude is in America because I havent been there in so long
Well theres alotof frustration I think over the fact that therere therere a number of evidences that the affirmative action
program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people are saying wait a minute
Why dont we just give everybody
uh an e try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone feels that theyve been discriminated against because of their race
go at it from the standpoint of of trying to remedy it through the courts
rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what
Right
And as a result some m some people are getting contracts just because
of the color of their skin and you know what Im saying its its its still
When they might not even be the most qualified
e either them theyre theyre not even theyre not the low bid
you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality spec specification
Right
And but now youve there have been several cases where clearly you know it was
they didnt get it because they just didnt werent the right color skin
So now is that
Right
is that really remedying the situation or is its creating alotof uh of resentmen
And
Right
its kind of too bad
How long
God what a mess
oh its a mess
It really is
W how long have you been there by the wa
Over her
um itll be three years in November
Wow
So you really are out of touch arent yo
Well I like to think Im not totally out of touch
Well y I know what its like
I was never very in touch even when I was still America so
oh okay
Youre that type
I got you
I was always in my in my own world anyway so
Well I know what its like because Ive went having lived over in Korea for almost three years its
you know when you come back all of a sudden the you know the society has changed a little bit you know
uhhuh
New terminology
New buzzwords
And all that stuff
Right
Of course when you get to be over forty like me um you can miss that stuff just being an American anyway
It all passes
I dont know
I always think when you get older youre more informed
When I was in college I didnt know what was going on
I was too busy
yeah
Im thinking of you know like lingo that the young people come up with you know
Younger people
yeah I think Im more informed now than I was in college
I was sort of out of it in college
But by the way u d did I tell you that I have a new jo
Well in your email you said that youre going to start your new job somewhere
You didnt say what your new job was
oh okay
Im resigned here last week effective August tenth and Ill be taking the job of the director of English language
the English language program of a private university in Atlanta
a larger university
uhhuh
So its kindof a step up for me
Its c its called Mercer University
oh well youll have to send us material from there
hey
Now were talking
Do you do you
to our advisor
you send people into E S L program
Well we get requests about it
I dont know how many people actually go because alotof them you know dont have alotof money but we get
students every year that ask about it that say they have money
Well you can be
They usually dont come though and tell us whether or not they go
yeah
Well you can be sure that we will send you information because
you know Ive got to go down there and were trying to r to improve the program were adding
theyre adding thousands of dollars of state of the art language e
you know equipment lab equipment and all of that and theyre restructuring everything so
thats what Im supposed to do next
Do they have any scholarships for foreign student
I Im Ive never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally but I think
We never did either but I keep thinking Im going to find one of these days
yeah
I know
Im sure that they pro You know I e the question of whether they have scholarships for international students
for the regular program is a good one and Id like to find out
Id like to think that they do
and and I think
uhhuh
they might but I dont know yet
Right
its not going to be my particular area of expertise you know i
Right
that thats going to be regular program but still I would like to know
so I can tell people like you
So were you looking for a new job or did they just like come to yo
Well I was looking for a new job and Ive been looking for about a year and a half
uh
and when I went to Nasa in New Orleans you know the one that you missed
I know the one the great one that was so much fun
oh it was a blast but Im not sure it was more fun than Miami I mean you know But it
it was fun though
You would have enjoyed it and as I said to you in the email the uh
the Russians and the Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious
I mean we had a
we had a nice little visit
We really did its too bad I didnt
oh I cant believe they were calling her Lovie
We were in stitches to hear that she was calling herself Lovie
oh reall
You didnt know tha
Well because you wouldnt say that
Because in Russian its just you know Lyubov but its just a Russian name
I mean you wouldnt
think of translating it into English but the thought of people calling her Lovie in America is so funny
Well thats the thats what she said
I mean I didnt know any
Well then I mean its so her like its just so her to do that that I just I just think its hysterical
Is i
yeah
You should have seen them dancing around with the crowd out there when they had this
uh Carribean band or something running through the streets of New Orleans
It was kind of interesting
uhhuh
But
yeah
And we went we went on a shrimp boat tour also
It was kind of fun
um
you know you got to sort of do that kind of weird stuff um I interviewed for this job at the at Nasa
So thats kind of how it got to where it was
you know that was a major
major sta sta uh s major point to reach is do that interview and that was a good interview so
Right
yeah I kind of I knew they were trying to expand their program and I said well if youre going to do that
call me because I would be interested in an opportunity and so Ive taken it you know
Well thats great
yeah
Im excited about it
Its g
Well what city were what city were you i
Were you far from Atlant
No
Actually Branow is located north of Atlanta about fifty miles north up the freeway
which around here is you know not even considered to be that far
uhhuh
But but this
And I dont even live in Gainesville which is the city where this universi where Branow is
I commute about thirty three miles from the southwest
Its a forty five minute ride
And Ill be commuting
So so youll be closer now
Well actually I may be two or three miles closer
Im going to be commuting down into Atlanta
see I live north of Atlanta
you can do
and
how do you know youre going to get this money
well
how legitimate is this
well people are getting checks
who is
mark is people above him theyre
yeah but marks selling to you of course hes going to tell you hes getting them
well I dont know I mean somebody must be seeing them
there are a lot of scams out there too
well I know but people okay people are buying in and
if the people above them were not getting their checks they wouldnt do it
how do you know
how do I know
how do you know theyre getting their checks
well why would they why would they
why would they do it
because you make the checks out to the company you dont make the checks out to them
what check
when you go in you make your money order out you send it to the company
right
you dont send it to the people above you
so why would the people above you be doing it if they they werent getting
right
how do you know theyre doing it
well because theyre spending time showing us
and having seminars why would they even
just mark you said is doing the seminars
yeah mark is and
why would he even do the seminars if he werent getting his checks that hes supposed to
because hes getting the money
no you dont send them to him you
oh well its a scam he gets it back
well I dont think so
he he does another one too he does
two different ones and hes focusing on this one now
all right
I mean you send it to some other state its out in
its Kansas or something I dont know
I forget where it is Oklahoma I forget
but its
its a different state you know
and it makes sense you know if you figure out how much money
if you figure out how much money
what do you call it
I mean dick already got his free cards hes been using his free calling card
mhm
and if you figure out how much money the company has by when you put in the money
and you know like you three thousand in each leg
it really only costs for long distance like about I dont know if its five cents a minute
and you get three six thousand dollars and youve only made twelve hundred of it
you know so they make enough money
to pay you theyre glad to do that
right
yeah
so
that
I mean its its a good deal for everybody
I mean four five cents a minute
nine hundred of of say five cents a minute times three hundred thirty minutes
is what
sixteen dollars seventeen dollars
at minimum thats thats trivial
yeah
I guess is that seventeen dollars
thats nothing
and then you got the
who says its five cents a minute
yeah is that seventeen dollars
yeah but who says its five cents a minute
excuse me
I dont know it must cost them like so little because it only costs sprint if it only costs the customer ten cents a minute on sprint
so they must
it must cost them only like five cents a minute
dick said it costs anywhere from four and a half to six cents a minute for them
I dont know where he got that number
but this guy mark he put his
mark put his you know his daughter under him and then his
girlfriends under him on another one and
you know hes got all these people that he knows so that they can make money but I dont know you know
mhm
Im Im already getting a few people to go to the meeting so
so thats good
yeah and lets see that guy I talked to yesterday Michael
hes real religious but hes going to
he he said hell go
he has to get some friends to go too so
you know it seems like its a its a great great deal its like
its like Mary Kay how Mary Kay works or anything else so why wouldnt it be legal
I didnt say it wasnt legal I just I just want to make sure that its legitimate thats all
well its only been around for not even three months and there are seventeen hundred people in it already
well I would I would want to know how they
how they do the calls because
what calls
I dont think MCL and sprint and and ATAndT are paying them
because theyre using their networks you know
uhhuh
how are they getting hows the call being completed and how are they getting their money
and I said well you know that far away from home any familiar face is a comfort even if it is just mike prices
yeah
yeah
anyway
well it was fun
the food was great
it was catered
it was just wonderful
wow
and I wont tell to everything because its all in your letter
okay yeah I notice that every time I get a letter its well weve covered all this
and
but its still good to get the letters
yeah you can reread them
reread them yeah and I have
reread them Larry
and get my pictures
yeah
oh yeah see they cant say r over here
some of these hotels a lot of the hotels when you get
in the elevator and you want to go downstairs you have to press lobby
lobby
lobby

theyll call me if they have any night classes available but right now they dont so
mhm

so I just have to wait and see
Northridge I dont know anything about either but its all in the letter
thats in the letter
mhm
lets see I talked to ken and Vicki yesterday ken I and I think ken might have gone to Arizona today to work
he got laid off when they stopped
well you were here when they had the big sink holes in Hollywood
no
due to the Metrorail
well theyve had those off and on well not big ones but
well there was this one that was about you know five blocks long it was just
oh really
well not five blocks but it was you know a good
good size hole
oh it they closed Hollywood boulevard for a long time it was about
sixty feet by a hundred feet or something it was big
and so they shut down Metrorail because you know its all because of that theyre not doing things the way theyre supposed to and consequently
the boulevards caving in
and ken was working that you know so
he he was laid off and he just
they said the other night that he thought he would go to Japan because he could get the Japan go to Arizona because he could
you know sign up and start working monday
only the pay is not as good as here so he has to work overtime and its a sixty hour week and therefore he cant come home on weekends so
now I think he I he was doing the yard this morning I said well maybe hes not going if hes into yard work
and then later I saw him packing up the truck
and then I missed when he left I didnt see you know Vicki say goodbye or anything so
he may be off to
to Arizona for god knows how long
we have new neighbors they moved in
well who are they what are they
theyre some kind of mexicans with three kids
oh boy
and a dog
oh boy
but the dog seems fairly cool he hasnt barked too much
is he a big dog small dog
fairly big he looks sort of like a
about bubs size but poodleish but doesnt weigh as much as bub
and Jojo had one of his parties again last night boy they were out there until all hours
well they do that so
I know thats fine I saw it I looked over I said gee I wonder if hes got the new people over there already you know
had is joey still going the lawn

he went on vacation the second week and I I took after hed the second week after hed done the grass two times I went over to
you know give him twenty bucks because I thought I knew he was going on vacation
mhm
and it was Dennis was there and I said well I know joeys going on vacation so I wanted to give him some money so hed have it
and Dennis said hes already gone and Vivian said Dennis mowed the lawn today and I said well
you make sure joey gets this money
anyway hes been doing a good job he forgot one day and
he came over later that night and he was just apologizing all over the place and I said its no big deal joey just do it tomorrow
you know
yeah
no Im sorry Im sorry I just feel terrible I said dont worry about it its no problem
I told him yesterday you might hire him fulltime because you dont like to do the grass
well I I might depending on how long this money holds out
well were going to have to buy a new car dear you know that
yeah I know that
my transmissions going
youre kidding
Im sure it is
its having trouble in reverse
wow
so Im keeping an eye on it but
we just have to do it thats what well do when you first get home well buy the new car
yeah
maybe have to do that right away
we really do we shouldnt try to get any more miles out of any of these because theyre going to get stuck somewhere
oh no I dont I dont really want to I just
want to get out there on that first week and start doing it you know
So tell me a little bit about the day she was born
When did you first see he
um what happened is we went to the hospital she was induced
mhm
So we get a phone call and th she was supposed to
Right finally
um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um its my thinking that this will be distributed publicly
Right
at six thirty in the morning but she called and they didnt have any beds
oh no
So she called us and told us that but then they did get a bed and she went in at eight
mhm
Or seven thirty or I guess she went in at seven thirty and they started her at eight or so so we hopped in the car and drove down to be there
mhm
mm mhm
for the day
mhm
And um
we hung out all day
We had we had some difficult times with the lawyer down there
He was supposed to show up
mm
mhm
and we waited all day and he never bloody showed up
oh no
And um he and also she was expecting him too
mhm
You know and so that was frustrating
yeah
But anyway we waited all day and
But then five twenty five Mae was born
Right
And the birth mothers mother was with her through the whole thing and she was fantastic
She was just great
She was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just a wonderful
uhhuh
mhm
Woman
person and
She was great
She came out you know a couple times during the day she came out and gave us little progress reports of how things were going and actually it was very funny
uhhuh
because the first time she out I mean here were out there sort of ringing our hands and
uhhuh
sweating it out and wondering how everybody is going and everything and she came out and could I go downstairs because um her daughter wanted playing cards
uhhuh
So I guess she was bored
uhhuh
You know passing the time
So I went downstairs to get playing cards with her and
uhhuh
and then later on she came out and she wanted some chewing gum
uhhuh
um I guess your mouth gets dry and you just want something
yeah
Im sure
So you know it was it was kind of funny these very
Reassuring in a way I would think
y yeah but these very um
yeah
you know theyre such sort of specific little things
yeah
And um
then but they kind of held her back
I think the baby wouldve born been born sooner but the doctor didnt get there till around three
So
so I thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it
No they can hold you back
hm
a little bit youknow
hm
Once depends how much stuff they give you
How much stuff they give you
yeah
Stuff
But anyway I think they were holding her back a little bit because they wanted the doctor there
mhm
uhhuh
um and the doctor showed up around three and Mae was born at five twenty five
mhm
Eight pounds eight ounces
mhm
And screaming
mhm
Really screaming and I was a little scared
I thought ohmygod what have we wrought
You could here her out through the doors of the hall you know
uhhuh
And there were alotof babies being born
You didnt hear them all
uhhuh
And I and um what happened h I guess um thats right
Her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born
uhhuh
And then she said thats her
You can hear her
And um said it was a beautiful birth
I mean two pushes and she was out which is really great so shes very unsquashed and unbattered looking for a new baby
uhhuh mhm
Right
Usually they look a bit bashed up
yeah
A bit worn
But shes got a nice shaped head and you know she doesnt look like she was um you know shes not a cone head
mhm
But did you get to see her in a few hours or
a
Well what happened no right away there there was a very nice
delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the day named Tina
mhm
mhm
mhm
And what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to the nursery
mhm
Normally they go directly and Tina very very sweetly zipped past the door to the out outer part of the nursery where we were waiting
mhm
mhm outside
mhm
and let us hold her
mhm
So she was just minutes old then
Wow
So we held her for just a couple minutes and
uhhuh
it was really funny because you could hear her coming up the hall screaming
uhhuh
loudly
uhhuh
uhhuh
She handed her to me screaming loudly and I said to Tina and also to the
uhhuh
the birth mothers mother there you know oh Robert has the magic touch
I handed her to Robert
Instant silence
uhhuh
uhhuh
Instant
She just stopped screaming immediately
uhhuh
uhhuh
So he held her for a little while
And then the nurse was afraid to take her back
Said oh shes going to scream again
uh
uhhuh
And she did
uhhuh
And off they went to the nursery and then you watched through the glass
That must have been very reassuring for Robert
It was very nice wasnt it
It was very wonderful for Robert and for me too just to see I knew it would work too
Very nice
yeah
uhhuh
uhhuh
yeah
I dont know what it is
He has some you have a theory
Body warmth or something but anyway
yeah
I think its partly it but therere certain kind of men who I think its men who have like these big
I have this theory that its men who are very broad right under the elbow youknow like
Wait a minute
Broad under the elbow
You mean in the ches
like
No
From the elbow down towards the wrist
oh
Who have like these big broad forearms
I think babies like that
You think it gives it gives security
I suppose
Do you remember Otto who moved my filing cabinet that time in Philadelphia hes another on
Yes
uhhuh
uhhuh
yeah
Hes big
Hes sort of solid to me
who
Hes sort of very solid and they just love it
But Roberts not big like that
No but he but Robert is big below the elbows Ill bet if you check
Ill have to check out below Roberts elbows
At any rate
So that was nice and then we watched through the nursery while they do
if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery youll survive anything after
Its the most sort of appalling introduction to life
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
But I was kind of scared at that point because were looking in and therere all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there limp
uhhuh
and theres Mae and shes big compared to the rest and she was bright red and she is screaming and she screamed and she screamed and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse
yeah
And she was healthy I guess
uhhuh
And she just screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and I thought ohmygod what have we wrought here
Did they tell you her apgar or whatever they call tha
How
They didnt tell us anything
In fact at the hospital they werent
the there were someth the individual people we had contact with were were decent to us and friendly
Were nice
but the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us and they wouldnt like we had been told we they have a room called the bonding room
yeah
uhhuh
uhhuh
and the whole purpose of the room is to let people be in it with the baby who
uhhuh
are going to be with the baby
Right
And they wouldnt let us in there so
mm
d it was really quite awful
They wouldnt let us they didnt they they gave us but they didnt tell us beans
yeah
I mean they really didnt talk to us
They didnt offer us that parenting class that they offer to most people
mhm
We would have had to come back the next day to the hospital which of course we werent going to do
hm
mhm
um you know they really werent very nice and
yeah
I guess they have their rules are just very rigid
mm
And the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have arranged for um
Right
an additional bracelet
mhm
In other words what happens is they put one on the wrist of the baby one on the ankle one on the birth mother
and then she has a what you call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff and of course she had given it to her mother
hm
mhm
hm
I see
I see
which makes perfect sense
mhm
Well the only way they couldnt get their minds around the notion of a fifth bracelet for us
Right
So the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mothers away
Right
which we wouldnt ask and which she wouldnt do
Right
Right
And
the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time
and there was supposed to be I D there at the hospital for us and it was all set and of course he hadnt done anything
I see
He hadnt done that hm
No
He hadnt done anything
Hes been just hopeless
hm
I mean I think legally hes not hopeless
I think hes done all the necessary legal things but
yeah
you know in terms of the things
Hes an S O B forgive me tape whoever you are but he was a fucker
yeah
No
th
And
laugh
Im sorry but he was
I think they said published actually
oh well they can edit that word I guess Anyway its English so
yeah
Its American English
um
You know he he said things to me like well youll have her for the rest of your life you know
yeah
Dont worry about it which is really an arrogant attitude to take you know
yeah
yeah
Man
yeah
He was really he was a real arrogant S O B so
How old was h
I dont know we never met him
He never showed up
oh
W he ended up in the end his par he sent his partner to actually sign the papers whos not even an adoption attorney
mhm
He does litigation
Doesnt know what hes doing but I hope he did what his partner told him to do
mhm
mm
mhm
But he at least was a sensitive human being
mhm
And um you know so that was nice
He had some sensitivity
Were going to get cut off soon
oh no
And I want to I hope you
Tell me something then
Ill shut up
You can tell me something
Wha
okay
No
Im worrying ab Im not worrying Im feeling like ohmygosh should all of this be in the public record or something
oh yes
Well they just beeped
I think that might mean we have to hang up
okay
We have a minute
um
I want to tell you I saw four parakeets fly across the street in Barcelona
oh neat
Is it thirty minute
It was beautiful
Is it
Its going to be thirty minutes in about five minutes I think
oh okay because theres a beep coming on my end
yeah
You dont hear i
No
okay
Well ignore it so well let them go on
Well
Well anyway
oh so that sounds very nice
They were loose or in a
Well I they were loose they were I said the Sheila I think I hear a parakeet
uhhuh
And you could tell he thought that it was nonsense that it was a
uhhuh
crow and then I saw it but the sun was against my eyes
oh how neat
so I couldnt tell and then it flew and when it flew three more of them flew out of the same tree
oh how neat
There was a street
They were beautiful
there was a street I walked down in Barcelona big wide
with all the bird sellers
Yes
They were closed up that day but Im sure that what these were is
Well it was g it was a wonderful place I mean I guess you have to sort of discount that theyre in cages but
Escapees yeah
yeah Its its part of
it was beautiful
yeah
I mean it was just so beautiful with all these amazing
yeah
birds and colors
And also in parts of Spain I dont know if they have this in parts of France but
Probably not
I saw parts of Spain where they had birds on the shutters and they put them out during the day
Its very popular in Spain but its not so popular here in France
yeah
It was a nice thing
yeah
um
Ive seen very little of it
yeah
y
I had friends in Madrid whose father bred birds actually
oh reall
In their apartment
yeah
Its quite a big hobby
Parakeets o
No little tiny birds
I dont know what they were
Little
Finches maybe
yeah
Song birds of some kind
uhhuh
oh neat
And he was good at breeding them
uhhuh
so
oh well thats good
So but when you went up to Connecticut all was wel
Or was that another adventur
up to Connecticu
Did I go to
Then you had to go up and get Jack and everything after
oh yeah its its NewYork still but
oh
um yeah we got up
We got Jack
We went to the lawyer our lawyer whos been
mhm
Absolutely fantastic start to finish
I think shes great
mhm
mhm
um and then came home and thats when yeah then Roberts mom crashed the car
oh I see it was after that that she did that
So
yeah actually we had to do that at like eight oclock the next morning because Martha was leaving by nine
So mom and dad were down there for how lon
They came Saturday and stayed Saturday night and Sunday and left Monday
uhhuh
This past Monday like
Im doing good I was going to Susans back and forth and my sisters back and forth so
yeah
Susans away this week so I might Im going to my sisters tomorrow she needs a babysitter on Thursday
yeah
so Im going tomorrow but I I feel like Im
I thought she was going away for vacation this week
shes away now
oh shes away now
but shes coming back tonight
yeah
yeah so I feel like this always happens when I get towards the end and I have this list of things to get
youknow like George he has a little list and I have to bring for him and his wife and his kids and I have to bring for
oh for f to bring back she gives you the list I wouldnt bring her back anything
yeah she gives me ohmygod she said did I tell you about thi the episode before I left
yeah you told me
oh shes such a shit well I just cant you know you have to pretend sometimes I bought her just a cute little like
uh makeup type of case you know if you have to go away you put a little makeup and sanitary pad and then I said to myself ohmygod maybe she doesnt have her period anymore
oh
shes like almost fifty
thisll be a funny conversation to listen to
yes and a little perfume inside of it I cant go and give everyone stuff and not her you know I am not going to
break off my relationship with him because of her
so are you still doing shopping around everyday
I still have to get Menash his sneakers I didnt
get them yet and Ive to get stuff at the Wiz for Menash for m m George
at the Wiz
yeah he wants some stuff for his video camera
oh
he gave me such a list and including sneakers for him and her I I cant bring the sneakers back
because Im going I dont want to take an extra suitcase with me I got to pay ninety dollars for an extra suitcase
yeah
and George said no I want some back and I bought two extras and they just let me go
well I cant take that chance they might not let me what am I going to do
the baby is not allowed a suitcase right
no nothing not even a carry on
so I
what do you come with one suitcase
no I was an idiot I came with two
two yeah
but I came with a regular one and a regular one inside of a big one
so what Im going to do is Im going to leave the small ones here
and
and take my mothers big one so I have two big ones
thats a good idea
because they really see Im doing a Michelle Im getting smart
yeah
Michelles very you know practical
um tho the
the other thing is instead of taking one of your mothers if she doesnt you know want to relinquish it or whatever
she doesnt care shell get it back
you buy you go the supermarket and you get a Pampers
oh
carton
right
and you just load it up and then you just throw the carton away
yeah thats true no she doesnt care Im leaving her mine
and shes giving me this one doesnt I dont doesnt matter for me
yeah I told Shera too I says if you need things why dont you start shopping around dont wait til the last minute
ohmygod no she cant because shes got kids and Im going with the baby all the time and youve got to do things really fast
she schlepped today she says she was going out of her mind you know look
for stuff
well your mother wasnt with her she
my mother had like a luncheon today and she was meeting a friend so shes
so she went with the three kids
no no Daniel was in a little day camp so she took
oh
Tamara and the baby
really they put them in a day camp
yeah theyre both going to a little camp I mean theyre bored every day just going to the beach youknow
thats good well good yeah sure thats fun
so Tamara goes three days a week
oh its really hard like Susan was taking me and shes with her kids you just got to know what youre going for
and do it fast and I get crazy because I say oh look at the dahdahdah
and I start looking and I want to try on and I and and you know I start seeing things and
my fathers good youknow hes taking me we went to Cross County shopping center in the morning uh
y well dont they have ads there in the Sunday paper of stuff on sale
yeah Caldors youre not even going to believe what I bought in I dont do you have Woolworths
Woolworths theres
yeah
not too many left around here
we have two in in in in in we have a few around
and I always wanted this a jean jacket you know a real rugged you know a regular guys jean jacket
yeah
and in Israel theyre pretty expensive and I saw here they were like sixty eighty
were in Woolworths and they have these beautiful jean jackets for twenty dollars
so I bought one its pretty funny getting clothes in Woolworths because theyre like you know five and dime stores
y yeah
you know cheapie but its theyre theyre its its beautiful its made in Italy
its really nice
good
and I want to go back there with my father because they have nice books and cardboard books with like cheap two for five you know mark down stuff English
ye

oh sure
um
because this kids learning English so quickly
the
did your brother bring
I cant stop
give you the money or hes going to pay you back when you go there
he said no he said let Mommy see it shell lay it out and Ill give it back to her when she comes my mothers like yeah right my foot

and and my fathers like you mean your he didnt give you money he didnt give you money hes almost fifty years old youre still buying
my mother didnt want to say no she
when is your
says that hes going to like pay back some of the stuff
when is your mother going to come visit
well she wants to come in October
yeah
but if my father doesnt want to come or if he has weddings hes not going to leave he gets like a wedding or two hell he wont go
yeah
and then my mother will not want to leave him which is the r same reason she didnt want to go to
she didnt want she wouldnt leave him f for a month or three weeks
but is he feeling okay
yeah hes feeling okay he had a little episode before you know but
so it might not even have been from that he felt dizziness
and maybe it was because of the was the heat or something
maybe the heat its so God damn hot here you could plutz
felt a little funny he felt a little funny in the chest but that could be a reaction because of the heat
it was really its its very humid you know its hot I mean Tiberius is very hot too
but its dry and this is humid I dont know whats worse
humid
I think the humidity
its very uncomfortable
its not humid in Tiberius in the summer
its dry no its like TelAviv is humid
yeah
there was another
did you hear
yes
uh I cant believe it
I was just going to say
terrible I just heard it yesterday Menash was in TelAviv with the kids

yeah
cant ask her so just spoke like five or six minutes it was ten dollars something it was like the medium price

yeah
so because I knew where they would be then I knew if I call at any other time like I I might get them I might not

so Gal was so excited they sound so good ga Gal is all excited shes
until she could get it out of her mouth she said I got my ears pierced earrings

oh yeah she yeah
so the the little one is really speaking English here
yes saying doggie ball bottle
well when you get back you have to like
I have to just continue but its hard you
start getting into this you know into the
0
thing again its not like Shera and Rick I wish it was you know two English speaking
yeah but you know what Menacher is speaking so much better now I cant get over him
when did you hear him
when we came in May
you were there really
you know my parents said oh he speaks English I says yeah he speaks English I says he doesnt really speak English
funny
but I could see that he must have been studying
well he didnt learn from me oh he wan no he wants me he keeps threatening Im going to take a
course in English because youre not teaching me how could I teach him
well speak to him in English
thats the thing but y y
its easier said than done y when you talk to someone that youre living with you know and you want to get
things done you know quickly and on the spot and you know
yeah thats true
you know what I mean
yeah
its easy y its very easy to say but you cant imagine until but
I mean I
oh I know people will yell at me why Claudio doesnt speak to me in Spanish
right
you know so
God willing you have
like
kids and I hope you would
yeah hell speak to them in Spanish
yeah so whats happening in that department whens the next thing
well I got to go Friday
did you get your period
for an ultrasound yeah I did
after we spoke aw did you cry
no
no good
no because
okay
I was you know it was late
uhhuh
it was thirty two days but
oh
um I thought maybe there would be some slight ch miracle that something may happen
yeah I hoped it will Im telling you I just
two girls that I work with
went through these things and they have kids now you know
so Im shooting up every night and
uhhuh shooting up your tushie
Friday Friday I got to go for the ultrasound
in your tushie
well in the morning and at night I give myself a shot in my
mm oh my
stomach
God ohmygod
and then at night Claudia gives the me a
what does this do for the eggs
well the shot that I take morning and night holds off the ovulation
yeah
and the shot at night promotes eggs egg gro f you know follicle growth whatever
uhhuh
so you got to do an ultrasound to what to see what
to see how theyre progressing if theres eggs there if theyre big enough
wait a second this is being recorded Michelle
I dont care they dont know me
oh okay
do I know you
do I know you
what else
Ill tell them a joke yet
this little boy
oh
says to his mother to his father daddy how does mummy get pregnant how does she have a baby
well the mummy makes the eggs and the daddy makes the sperm and we put them together and the mummy grows a a baby in her belly
yeah
so the little boy says to his father well how does the sperm get into her belly does do you put it in through her mouth
so the father says only when she wants jewelry
jewelry
you dont get it
um maybe Im not sure say
oh Beth
oh shit what
only when she wanted jewelry like shell give him a blow job only if you know she wants something
oh okay okay
oh oh Beth
only if she wants
you need an interpreter
like diamonds and gold I guess I have to have some more experience
oh my
oh no
you are f too much
okay okay yeah yeah no because they call those the family jewels
so I didnt know if
that had something to do with it or
no no
no I knew blow job I understood blow job
but I didnt know jewelry okay when she wants something when she wants a diamond ring or something okay
yeah right right
okay
okay
so what else how much more time do we have
anyway
how much more time I dont know theyll come on and give us the little ding ding
yeah
oh so Im the one you called Im so thrilled
yeah
Im so honored
meanwhile I called youre just sitting down to dinner your mother will shoot me
and the same
hes hes not
eating at the table
because when he sits at the table he has to kind of lean forward
yeah
to the plates
yeah
and I said thats a no no
mhm
and so and yet he said he can go out for dinner
youre not
yeah because youre not youre not supposed to have that at a ninety degree angle
what
youre not supposed to have it more than a ninety degree angle
oh
more than ninety degree
so I always had something you know a pillow under there or something
right right and you know people think were nuts
you know people come to visit and I say you can sit here there and there but you cant sit in those two chairs because those are the chairs that Allie sit in
yeah
and they look at me like well what difference does it make
you know it makes a lot of difference
oh
the chair hes in
sure yeah
and then Ill say to him put your leg down
you know
and they think what is she badgering him for
but he forgets and he pulls that leg up
and it is supposed to be extended
yeah
a little bit you know
yeah
hes a wonderful patient though
yeah sure
you know and
he he
and its very early yet Toni my god
well thats what Im saying you know I
this is only a week
I said to Brent you know he was operated on friday and home monday and
yeah
he said I didnt realize that
he said thats a little soon I said you bet your bippie
and and its not nice for you either
no no Ive never been so frightened
because
you know when he fell
yeah
oh
that did something to my confidence
Im sure
you know I mean Im pretty confident and Ive been around sick
people and you know my mother had her hip
and you know Im I
and certainly I work with the fragile
mhm
in special Ed you know
and Ive never
been so nervous as I was that night
well thats enough to scare the life out of you to
uhhuh
bring him home and have him fall
right you know and then all I could think of is if he
pops something it was my fault
yeah
you know
really wasnt my fault but thats how I felt
you know and then somebody else was saying well you need to laugh more and I thought laugh more Ill smack you
yeah you know so when Im not laughing or Allies not laughing theres something wrong you know
yes because you do very well in that area too yeah
yeah yeah
and then somebody else said well you need to get out more Toni
and I thought why
I want to be with Allie
yeah sure
you know I have no desire I wouldnt care if I ever went out again you know
and she said oh you need to get out and you know be among people and everything and
thats because she needs that she could this person can never stay home five minutes
but I dont need that I cant tell you the last time Ive been in a department store
and Im sure he doesnt want to go out
oh no he was terrified at the doctors today because
oh yeah
little kids were running around and the mothers werent watching
is he using the walker or the crutches
he was using the walker and
then monday the nurse the therapist encouraged him to try the
crutches
uhhuh
and so today he used the crutches going to the doctors office
because it was easier
the doctors office no matter where you park
you have a long walk
to the door
because they have like a courtyard
yeah
instead of having handicap
parking
and the area that you have to walk on
half of it is like fake stonework
oh boy yeah
theyre crazy
this is for an orthopedic group
you know
theyre nuts
yeah
and and then when we went to
pull into the parking place some dude
in you know in the handicap parking place he had taken up two
places where the ramp was
a young kid
and I said to Allie boy I hope he gets in that car when Im out here because Im going to give him a piece of my mind
but I was parking the car when he got in and took off you know so I didnt get my opportunity
but anyway he used the crutches going and coming I had the walker with me but he
see I never use the Id I never I would be afraid to use
yeah he he was quite comfortable with the crutches
I think theyre newer
and but he cant use them for any length of time because he gets tired
yeah
and so lets see what else so
the swelling has now pretty well gone down but he said to wear the sock for another week
during the day
he told me to get vitamin e and break it open and put it on the incision
that helps in the healing of the incision
mhm
and
you know and to put peroxide on the incision and that
and then one question we didnt ask
pretty good
yeah
pretty good how about yo
Busy busy busy
yeah sch
I took some summer courses
I started in May
I took an English Lit for five weeks and then I took Psych and Soc which Im finishing up next week
I cant wait
Is it Psych like
Psychology Introduction Psychology
Introduction yeah Ive taken that
and Socio
Sociology is alotof work
yeah what kind of Sociolog
Its just general Sociology
okay
um
You have to record write up journal write ups and stuff like grab articles out of the paper
about specific topics and I have to write a paper and hand it in by the end of next week
mhm
Theres alotof digging information that has to go with it
Theres alot a work to it whereas Psych I just have to study the chapters and take my tests
yeah
And Ive gotten As on all my tests
Good
So Ive gotten As for that
I know I hate I hate research
Its hard
Its very hard
And then you have t
Well it takes so much time
mhm
And Ive been working up until like last week
I hurt my back picking up Shanley
So I mean Ive worked the past two weeks
oh youre kidding
So Im going back Monday though thank goodness
Because I dont have any sick
Do you have to go through any physical therapy or anything like tha
yeah Im doing that now
yeah
yeah I went last week and then I went Im going three times this week
I see the doctor tomorrow
mhm
So hopefully Ill get a note saying go back to work on Monday because Ive no time to use
You know for sick time and stuf
yeah because you took time when you had your surgery on your knee too righ
mhm
Exactly
I used alotof it up at that time
mhm
So I have none left whatsoever
I had to use up my last two vacation days because I had they make you do that now for some reason
which is fairly new which really isnt fair but
What do you mean beca it because you were out sick or
Well Ive been out all week and I said do I have any sick time she said I had seven hours and I said well just give me the seven hours of sick and that eight hours of holiday
So I have eight hours worth of pay thats it
uhhuh
I said dont use my vacation time
She told me she had to
oh
Now I have like two days left
uhhuh
Like sixteen hours which was going to cover me for at least a couple days in August so I wouldnt like go without a check
yeah
but they told me they had to pay me that sixteen hours of vacation time
huh
which is mandatory which I think stinks
yeah
You know
hm
but I just cant wait to get back to work and
Back to normal
yeah
and I like taking courses and I really like it but I dont like taking summer courses not like two at a time
yeah
Its so crammed in
mhm
for five weeks
yeah because we do t and we do like two chapters we have to study for tomorrow and I only read one thoroughly and the other one Im going to read and learn
so Ive got to go to the library and ba basically box myself in like in one of those little cubicles and just read it and and learn it that way
mhm
Because I cant really concentrate unless Im totally away from things
yeah
Like Im home and the T V is on in the other room I can hear it
Right
I need to be totally isolated and have just everything block everything out
mhm
Thats the only way I can study
yeah
I mean I cant even study if Im with Patrick
because Ill sit Ill read stuff
yeah
like I can read a book but I cant like study and because I dont I cant block everything out
yeah
so
So you guys are still seeing each othe
yeah its its weird because couple days after I wrote you Mal was really bummed out
yeah
And we talked and stuff and I mean I told I miss him and me I was crying on the phone
He was crying on the phone
mhm
Because I said are you going to miss m
He said well I miss you already and it was like you know why we doing this then
yeah
So I figured wed
take more time give him some more time and like evaluate in like six months like in October
mhm
So weve been seeing each other up until and you know we still have been seeing each other but I dont like go to family things of his
mhm
which is kind of weird and Im like I wrote him a letter over this past week and told him
how this is not enough you know I said its you knew this was going to happen at some point you have to make a decision either you want us to be together or you dont
yeah
you know my feelings and
thats just the way it has to be I said this isnt like its a new relationship
Weve known each other for ten years and weve gone through the good bad and the ugly
yeah
and we were still here because we love each other so that should mean something or that should show you
you know that shou that should be significant somehow
mhm
I think it is but were going to talk about some stuff on Friday and then were spending the day together Sunday
Is he working no
No in fact he got laid off
Did you know tha
I think I think h
Im not sure if he got laid off and was laid off when grandma died
I think he was
yeah
I think he was
but h
but he was going to I dont know he was going to do something
Was he going to go to
He had gotten some money for school
yeah
so he took English Comp which he got a an A minus in I believe because he really hes a really good writer
uhhuh
and he really writes from his soul and hes taking of all things Anatomy and Physiology which is the toughest thing he could take and
yeah I know I dont ever want to I dont ever want to take that
and hes having a hard time with it but hes busting his butt I mean hes hes done some work and has gotten some really good grades and some just mediocre grades
so hes take he wanted to prove to himself that he could do it so he took the hardest thing he had to take forever
Next time hell just be doing the A and P of the alcohol abusive person
mhm
So he told me today he just got his test back he thought he did really well but he got a sixty eight and hes so ticked because he made some careless errors he
skipped one question and went on to the next but when he wrote th the the letters in
he put it on that particular one and then when he answered the other questions the other three were just off because they werent in the right spot
oh
mhm
At the last four which were right which he would have had credit for were wrong because he put them on the wrong space
Right
Right
and he was really ticked off at himself
Did is that passin
yeah sixty eight is passing I mean a D is passing
yeah well see it theres different scales that people have
mhm
for grades
yeah
and sometimes tha tha you know like a I dont know I dont remember how it goes but
Its passing but for some particular programs you have to have at least a C or better
mhm
So I was lucky I got a B in English Lit but that was like the first time I wrote a paper in like eight years
Was that an interesting clas
I liked it yeah
I didnt like the poetry
mhm
and having to analyze poetry but I liked English Literature I liked analyzing the stories
yeah
I enjoyed that part and that part once I got the hang of it was okay
yeah
and my first paper I got a C on and Id knew the story really well
It was intelligently written but I didnt like dig into it
mhm
and the second paper I got a B minus and then and I never really liked the author of that story either
I didnt really understand the story so well
yeah
Called The Misfit
I didnt like the author Flanner OConnery
oh
Ive heard of him
but Ive never read anything
um and th the third one we did is Hamlet which I loved
I love Shakespeare
hm
So I had to write a paper on Hamlet
Shakespeares hard to understand I think
It is
because you have to keep going down to the footnotes and like
learning what the words mean and stuff
mhm
but we also watched the film I got th the tape the movie with Mel Gibson and
oh
I watched that
yeah
and I really enjoy that kind of thing
mhm
so I wrote a good paper I made up my my little poem at the end of it
and I got a B plus and I because I really I added more to it you know
yeah
It was really it was really well done I really and that was the easiest paper for me to write I dont know if it was because I had done two before that or if I just really enjoyed the material I was working with
yeah that helps
but I got a really good grade on that and I got a B on the course but I worked really hard for it and it wasnt easy
yeah
You know and then for Psych and Soc I got three As on my test for Psychology Im taking one next tomorrow and then one on um next Wednesday thatll be my final grade
yeah
And then for my midterm on Soc Sociology I got an A
hm
and then Ill take my other final next week so its a lot Sociologys been alotof work
You going to take anymore classes after thi
yeah Id like to take Introduction to Art or or History
mhm
or take a philosophy and maybe I dont even know if I even want to tackle a Spanish yet
yeah
I have to have a language but I dont really know if I really want to do it now
I think Im going to take it do you guys have tele course
Do you know what those ar
What are the
Tele courses
Its like you you get a video
mhm
and you just you know watch the video at home
mhm
and you do your own the reading and the the work and stuff at home and then you go in however so often they have a schedule set up to the school and take your test
oh reall
Its like in a testing s center
uhhuh
Wow
And Im Im going to try that since I took you know alotof French in High School
yeah
I thought maybe it wont be too hard
huh
to do it that way Im going to try and take it
that would be interesting
yeah
because we did a
well see
study evaluation on us
We had to write down on Psychology and it turned out that Im a Im a what do you call i
something observer
reflective observer when I study
mhm
When I do things like kind of like like sit back and watch the stuff and I
yeah
I could be very quiet in the class
I dont really participate alot in the class
when I pay attention Im always there
mhm
but I dont like say alotof stuff
yeah
Not in the Psychology class I dont
I just dont feel comfortable with it like with the people that are in there
yeah
so I just I listen so I know everything I comp I comprehend everything I know it but
Is there younger students in
or just are they mostly adults o
Theres theres a mix
There some high sch not high school kids like nineteen twenty year old
yeah
and theres some married women in there an older woman
mhm
and then younger kids
Theres a couple black people in there
yeah that sounds about
You know its its a good mix
like what it is here yeah
but it seems like this kid who Im not saying oh I hope Im not being prejudice but hes black and hes like always questioning the teachers and stuff and he thinks like
well if your father you know if thats if you were told that you were brought up in a house you do what he says you know thats
thats okay to learn that and stuff and thats okay to do to your kid and shes trying to teach him that its not okay to do that
mhm
thats not how you build someone selfrespect and to do things like that and its like a couple people like to argue with her and like
they think teachers are really ignorant and stupid you know
well she got to be the teacher she must have done something
but yeah
So but its its good I mean its been interesting
They had a hypnotist come in the other day but I didnt want to do it just because I wasnt very I was skeptical of it and not really enthusiastic about it
yeah
I didnt feel comfortable like I wa I was more interested in watching people around me
mhm
like see if they really kind of like really got into it and
I dont know if I would ever do it I
Id be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized I dont know if Id
oh I would too
be afraid or
Corning Revere County Seat thats clothes
yeah
Eddie Bauer of course Ive
never thats the girls place
yeah
No
And then that Etne Anye or
oh right
yeah they have that and
or a shoe place mm
Lets see here for house wear Florsheim shoes Geoffrey Beene
Perria and David I dont know what that is Jockey
Jones of NewYork
lets see and then theyve got a couple leather places
they never get into Girbaud places but they never do
Never get wha
Thats the one Girbaud
oh
Thats the brand of jeans that he likes
oh no theyre thats not on here
I mean it never is
Its one of those things like whenever a s store has a sale of
twenty percent off anything or something its always excluded you know
oh jeez
know its like ripoff
Luckily the ki the girls have never bought that
Its a boys thing I or mans thing girls dont wear them I dont
oh
oh
okay because Ive never heard them talk about that
And theyve got Leggs and Levis
Music for a Song
Nordic Track
Osh Kosh Petite and Sophisticated I thought mother might like that when shes here next year
yeah
and Reebok Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory
Daddy said something about I said well we can go to the zoo he said no no we dont want to go anywhere we just want to sit around and talk
oh
And I said you have to see our zoo its really cool its got the jungle and the penguins and the sharks and everything he said okay
oh yeah
yeah
She didnt want to just sit around and talk shes ready to go someplace so
yeah
Well theyre I mean I I want to do some of that but you know you can only
yeah and I and I decided not You know to wear them
and I said well you have to go to Mister Cs the plastic grapes and Christmas lights and Daddy said well yeah we have to go there
I mean
Well
yeah
Well even at the beach you know whos the one who always wants to go to or
yeah yeah
thats right yeah of course I think he feels like he
you know
needs to entertain us down there so
entertain us
But daddys a goer and
yeah hes a goer he gets tired of just
He gets tired but he likes to go to I figure he loves that Nelson Art Gallery
sitting around yeah
yeah
So I figure well go down and I havent been there for quite a while and they al they change it alot you know
yeah they change the exhibits and stuff
Right so I thought wed go down there and have lunch in that
um atrium type deal they have there and do that
yeah and I think the thing is he doesnt
want to go like for a whole day necessarily but if he just goes some place part of the day I think that
Right
yeah
Right
kind of yeah
yeah thats kind of what I figured wed do
And then
I had a
letter from Mommy yesterday
oh what did she sa
She wrote some kind of
interesting stuff
oh reall
about Todd just a little bit
yeah what
I dont know if she told you that or not about how they had an offer on their house and stuff
yeah she did tell me they had an offer because I called her to talk to her about the
yeah
cost of the plane tickets
yeah
and
I said well what are they asking for the house
And she didnt know
She just knew that the offer was thirty thousand dollars below
But Todd told me they were asking two sixty
oh really
yeah
hm
And he or two fifty nine ni I cant remember what he said but he said they had it like
at two sixty
and then agents said they should put it like
two fifty nine nine or something so that
yeah yeah
because some people and I didn
yeah that makes
you know and I thought they should probably put it at like two
be below two fifty would be a normal cutoff place for alot more people you know
oh yeah
And
Well but the thing about that is some people look a little higher than that and then offer two fifty
Right yeah
you know god that is so noisy I hate it when the girls do that when Im on the phone
What is i
The ice maker
oh f
And I mean it just sounds like an earthquake you cant hear a thing when thats on
yeah yeah
um what did they pay for the hous
What did they pay two
what two twenty five or something and then they put in the pool
yeah
And she said she said it was
twenty below their bottom line
So apparently theyre willing to go down ten
mhm
But to me just sell the freaking thing
I mean get rid of it
I mean if they had an offer they should jump on it man
yeah
I mean well I mean well you look what happened to on his house and they can take that loss on their taxes
oh yeah
yeah
You know I mean you can recoup a little bit
It probably wouldnt even be a loss I dont know what the pool cost but itd probably be about
well two thirty yeah it would be a loss
yeah they would take a loss on it but you c like I said you can write that off too
yeah
on your taxes and because when
But Susans the one youd think would be wanting to get rid of it because shes the one whos paying for nothing basically at least Todd gets to live there so
oh yeah
oh yeah
I know well I know when
You know
Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house
He had to sell it at a loss
And weve taken that loss on the tax return I think next year is the last year we get to take it and he said thatll really hurt us when we dont get to take that anymore
yeah
And I forget you can take so X number of dollars
a year
spread it out over yeah
yeah you can stretch it out and
thatll be gone but you know
yeah
thats kindof a nice w especially if hes going to be a single person
yeah and she said that he
you know
said neither one of them had filed for a divorce and that that wasnt an issue the main thing was selling the house first and then they could get the rest of it in order
hm
and he said something about
how weird
that Julie has really butched out I guess shes got her hair cut
oh really
like
short as a ma or you know shorter than alotof mans you know and
oh jeez
and mother shes so funny when she writes something about she thought Susan was a
man in the relationship and then she said I dont know much about this can both of them be men
oh jeez well Susan definitely wants to be a man theres no
yeah yeah so e but this other gals got her hair butched that short and
no
doubt about that
god yeah sounds like she wants to be a man too
mhm
jeez
so like mother says who knows maybe they can both be men
I guess so
That is just so bizarre
yeah it really is
But like I said I think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them
yeah
because we wanted happiness for Todd but
oh yeah
oh yeah that was my very first thought and I thought oh dont be so mean dont even say that you know
yeah yeah
But I I looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it took me a minute to decide
which one was
which one was Todd you know its like hm hm
yeah
yeah
well and Ill never forget that night when they were right before the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girlfriend
mhm
and how you know she thought you know this girlfriend at work said they would couldnt be friends anymore and she told her that was silly and I thought why is she telling me about a girlfriend
yeah
yeah
yeah I remember then
its just the whole thing you know I mean yeah
all the little bells went off in my head but I just thought no no no no you know
yeah yeah
I know theres a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and
her last kid just graduated from high school and she was talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah blah and
mhm
yeah
and
Id seen her a year or so ago at a restaurant with
a lady and
you know and they acted guilty when you saw them you know it was one of those things I mean it was a Saturday night you know bu
but it was kind of like sh and it was a small restaurant that a
mhm
huh
yeah
yeah
the other people picked but it was like way out of the way and not a place Id ever been before ever heard of and
Right
And there she was and so she kind of it was it was just a little different than it normally you know
uhhuh
And I thought thats kind of strange and then I thought they a they kind of looked like they were
you sitting pretty close and stuff and
yeah
so anyway then my secretary told me that day she said oh Lorena was in today did you know she bought a house I said well we
talk in the spring and she said some she was going to and stuff and she said
mhm
well she bought it with another lady
mm
And I said
oh and I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird
and stuff and she said well Ive always kind of wondered about her because she is a real man hater she just
uhhuh
I just figured that was because
oh really
she went through a bad divorce and and he really did
yeah
he
ran around he had another woman and yeah it was kindof a bad deal for her so
yeah
huh
But anyways you know it just all makes sense you know and like you said the little signals were kind of there but you just think oh thats you know
yeah
yeah
dont jump to conclusions you know just because a ladys out with another woman you know that doesnt mean shes a lesbian or anything
and then I really thought even if they live together I suppose they dont
mhm
necessarily have to have a sexual relationship
No they dont have to
I mean Ive thought of doing that before and I I still think if
something happened to Ted you know later on and I had a woman friend that I enjoyed and stuff I wouldnt you know Id
mhm
yeah
be opposed to
oh yeah
get a place together or something to share expenses and having a companion and stuff and it wouldnt mean we were sleeping together but
Sharing a place
Each to their own
Yes thats right
Its just too bad Todd had to be caught in something
yeah a
messed up with all that so
Yes
I guess hes still going to church every Sunday mother said hed stop by on his way to church or something and
yeah
So I dont know maybe he can
yeah
find somebody else at church
If hed get another church you know I think that would be better you know
oh yeah
And
and then
quit going over to see her parents and stuff I think thats just kind of prolonging the agony too so
oh it is
It is but I think you
but if you need that you do it until you dont need it
yeah
Right you have to let go gradually I think no
yeah
yeah yeah and when when
hell know when thats not right for
anymore so
right
yeah it might
so
poor little brother but
mhm
He seems to be doing fine really I think so
yeah
yeah
But its just kind of interesting and then she wrote some stuff about Mary Blakeman
oh reall
God wha
hang on a second I got to get this letter its just right over here
okay
This is just for you
Itll just take a second
yeah alright
thought I had everything here ready for my call but I had my
oh
juice and my banana and everything lets see here so I forgot this letter what did she say she said
oh
I went out to see Mary last week theyve moved her from the therapy department to a regular room and her roommate is a black woman
Mary was out at the nurses station waiting for Bill and Leslie Ann to pick her up and take her home
They told me shes been doing it for a couple of days
She did know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait
Then she asked me to take her home and I told her I couldnt
Then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming
Finally I tried to explain they werent coming and she asked who isnt coming
God
So
my heart heavy I told her I had to go and left
I had tried to get
her to go back to her room but she kept asking me why I said that was her room
So sad
I surely hope I never end up in that state
hm
mm
If I do dont ever come see me and break your heart Better to remember me as I was not in that condition
mm
So
trying to see if she said anything else about
Todd
um
oh yeah she said he was going up to Baltimore for a week so she was xxxsitting yeah
yeah she was cat sitting yeah she told me that
yeah she said they have an offer house thirty thousand less
um no I talked to Dougo
oh hows he doin
Well I guess Well Do well the thing is Dougos kindof annoying me a little bit
oh wh
Well the first first of all well I I I di h I think he sort of knew he did I didnt want him to be here

But still he oh I want some place to bring people

Well I was kind of saying I was kind of hesitant
yeah I e w I dont know if you asked me
You mentioned it and then it came up to discussion after youd mentioned it to Dougo
But beforehand Id kind of been kind of like negative on it
So
I dont know I just I guess I never really thought that it would be that big a deal you know
yeah well Well
I mean I I d I just think that its largely because youre in a really high stress situation now
Im in a situation where I need full control of my environment
I know ex I know that
yeah so so
I was just
And so I think thats why youre
And then no but anyway he doesnt call and I just all he d i I mean Friday and all he did was give this message today I want a key
I mean talk about a little bit th rude Im sorry
Well
Thats really rude if you ask me
Its just like w I I just want to use you for something here
I mean just
I dont think its like that sweetie I think youre overreacting
Well I think e the behavior indicates that at least
At lea at least you know Mist Mister Mister very sensitive and aware of other peoples behavior is obviously not super aware of his own a little bit
So
No you know that
Well no but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway righ
Well Ill just
I I mean
I will Ill act abrupt then also so its its sort of funny
Well
But anyway
The movie was good yesterday though
I a Im I I might call him back Monday
Well sweetie what am I supposed to d
You know
oh youre not supposed to do anything Ill take care of it
ah I I am going to mention to him that I did think it was sort of rude that he didnt do that and all I get is this message blah you know
Well you could yeah I mean I think its valid for you to yell at him for standing you guys up and stuff
And
Well it wasnt a official plan but its not as if he gave me a number to contact him at
yeah
yeah so I just I was a little bit
a little bit put off by it
yeah
You know
And and I was saying
Well he could probably say that he felt put off by you too
So
I dont think so
I was the one who suggested going out and doing something
yeah
The only thing he can be say put off by me is that my h life hangs in the balance and I would like to be left alone
I dont think that thats unreasonable
yeah
You know I e you know its
Well I know I agree but i you know um also if you know uh youre not going to be there
During this week or two or whatever
The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a so soft place to lie your head down and fall asleep and wake up y cook food or whatever
and putz around once in a while thats fine
But if you want a place where you know its its time for a SaturdayNightFever party Im sorry i e thats
oh come on
hes not quite like that I mean good grief
Yes but still thats kind of my
you know
no hes got people that he hasnt seen for a quite a while
But dont they dont they live somewhere
Well
You know what Im saying
Well n not all of them
eh I mean I get the impression not all of them can you go back to that place
I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it
No but anyway
Well because I some of them
you know its
oh I understand I think I understand what you were saying now
yeah
I think I figured it out that
yeah
So he would like to have a place where eh they can come and visit him
yeah
And so
and so
Its fine with me
Never mind I thought about a hilarious word play
But anyway never mind
Wha
I I dont want to say
But thats its not its not its uh its a word play on what you just said its kindof a switcheroo its but i i it th it comes in it comes i theres some truth to it you know
oh
oh
Whats what is i
Well th th he or they can they can visit him and come on him
ah ha ha
uh
Instead of coming and visiting
yeah well okay
I just
But I I mean anyway
Anyway
So e my my my thought on the whole thing is that
you know if if you visited him you wouldnt want to have to be
you know spent panting and spending every second of the day w with him only
You know what Im saying and that
probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with him is that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever and g and
Wher
What are you talking abou
In Japan
Im not going to Japan
No but I mean
Im trying to
May maybe in ten years but no time soon
No no but no you know what Im saying
When you are visiting a town and you stay at someones house and you cant ever do anything on your own and stuff like that
So
oh I dont mind he does stuff on my e his own
I just uh
you know I mean theres a difference between guests and theres a difference between ownership I think
I think that
I know
but
There I mean if if if I live somewhere you know I can rearrange the furniture
yeah
But if Im staying somewhere it doesnt mean Im Im Im in jail
I mean just because Im in a motel doesnt mean Im going to repaint the walls
But it doesnt mean that Im obligated to stay there either
oh well I know but e
Im just saying there are different degrees of you know I I and I dont think hes obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me the entire time either
I wouldnt want him to
yeah
You know I told him I said I have no time to do anything
And I I said I
Well maybe thats why he was trying
And as soon as as soon as I move back here hes out
I I Im Im to totally insist on it
I dont care if he never talks to me again
Because theres no way I can study with worrying about keeping somebody awake or you know I have to worry how w how Im dressed if Im clean
You know
Whatever
yeah well I I agree with that sweetie
But in that case I think that while
I mean he can stay while Im at Erzhebats thats fine
Thats just
Ex that was my point
That was my whole point
That
yeah
okay
What is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling him to do what he wants
And
Well I have to go make a copy too
Do you want me to well
Give him the keys and
You know what Im saying
And Im kind of thinking about saying well heres here give me a couple of bucks Ill make a copy
yeah or just give him just
give him your set of keys one day when youre studying and say here and bring it back
You know go make a copy and then bring it back
And
I I mean I dont think its that unreasonable for him to ask for a key when I e you know at least I anyway
yeah
yeah
okay maybe not you have offered long time ago that oh yes you can stay here and blahdeeblah
yeah
And j he knows that youre not going to be there
So I think that you know I d I dont think that its unreasonable at all
okay yeah
I just think he needs to know that there are limits
Or whatever
That I dont want it I mean Id like to be able to come here
during the day anytime
And not feel like if I need a book or something
yeah
uhhuh
I dont want to feel restrained because itll frustrate me
uhhuh
and I wont be able to concentrate
Well I think that that would be reasonable
Just e make an agreement with him at what time you know after what time of day will you call f before you come over
yeah
You kno
Or you know so like between
um eight P M and
you know ten A M
Ill if I c have to come over then Ill call first
Like that
I mean I dont think thats unreasonable you kno
Or something like that
yeah
Because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know whats going on
yeah
You know
yeah
And and plus you know youre going to be at uh Suzannes for what till the eleventh or somethin
No till
Well thats right
yeah when you come back I guess Ill be Ill still be there
Still be there right
So
because youll be around
Right so and then so just
But youll be over here packing at that time partially
yeah partially sure of course
I deposited your other rent loan check that came in
oh good
How much was i
And I it was nineteen something
okay
the the thing is I took out
two hundred and fifty out of the account
Im going to pay the electric bill
Im going to pay
M B N A
Im going to pay some other people
okay
That sounds good
really
over a hundred d
I read that in like in Chicago they said theyre preparing for another heat wave
mhm
but then I watched Sunday Morning or part of Sunday Morning
mhm
and it didnt it showed it only in the eighties so Im like
somebodys not telling the truth here its hot over here though too
oh it its really mhm
itll be I I think when you lets see youll be coming in
last year I remember that it was rainy in August but
this years so bizarre that you might hit it when its really nice
hm
youre too
thatd be cool I mean its just been h unreal bad here
really
dry
humid
mhm the other day we went to see Waterworld
uhhuh
its kind of fun
is it good
yeah its kind of good
is it worth I mean there was alotof hype or whatever that it was not going to be a good movie
well because they spent so much money on it I c I think for the amount of money that was spent its its not the you know its not
not
the blockbuster maker
uhhuh
deal but its it w it was good
really
I mean its just you sit there and its very tense because its all action
uhhuh
all of it its all action
mhm
and it was fun watching the credits
mhm
the credits rolled for at least a half hour I waited for a half hour Tom went
youre kidding
Tom went outside he goes I am not into this he goes you can watch I said thats fine so I watched it
for half and hour
for a half hour because I dont know it was just it was just funny because I could not believe
how many different things were involved in this movie
mhm
and I figured there would be so I wanted to watch the credits and it was they were still rolling after a half hour
youre kidding
no it was a half hour worth of credits
jeez is it a long movie
yeah it actually is its about two and half hours
wow every you know what
but you dont feel like it because its moves so fast
you dont I just have something about going to movies now I feel like
w whatever happened to the hour and a half movie I need those
those are w thats my attention span after that its like
Im out of here I cant watch anything over two hours is okay when it gets in
yeah
two and a half hours is like no way even if its the best movie I have to watch it in two parts and thats when I have to do it on video
yeah
it was it was a bit long because of you know youre dealing with the same there there
its a cartoon mentality
mhm
type of film but the actions interesting the special its not
is the acting good
yeah its okay the kid theres a kid in there thats really fun youd like the kid because shes just
uhhuh
doesnt stop
uhhuh
shes good you know she goes youre going to be in trouble you know she doesnt care what she says
mhm
and so its kind of fun
uhhuh
shes kindof a cool character Costners interesting because hes not really a hes kindof a bad good guy
uhhuh
and
y there arent very many I mean there there arent very many special effects which was why this
movie was so expensive I mean there is animation and stuff in the c
mhm
Lord knows I saw the credits so I I dont know
uhhuh
but but its its alotof its real
mhm
what they do its so its pretty incredible when you when you
watching it and the its kind of funny the idea of smokers these the bad guys are all smokers
mhm
and they smoke
oh
it is just funny
uhhuh
I mean that whole things kind of funny Tom and I were cracking up about that
oh thats fun when did you see it this weekend
mhm
uhhuh
yeah we went to well no we went he took the day off Friday because he took me to the doctor
uhhuh
so we went to the doctor and then we went to this movie afterwards so
uhhuh
yeah
wow so
so it was kind of cool
uhhuh have you gone back to city lately or
huhuh I was thinking about going before we go to Florida because I wanted to take maybe take Gritti out there although we have
one person that would look after Gritti here
uhhuh
shes so Toddlike you got to meet this
0
guy he just makes me think of Todd
really
big time the only thing thats
different about him from Todd is that he has a kid you know
oh gosh
and thats about it
he likes fifties
yeah
he does
what was that the other day we were looking at something he goes wow thats so fifties thats so cool its you know

0
God this
0
guy is
Todd hes super nice though you know

well thats good
oh I wanted to tell you Matts dad died
oh really
yeah
oh
in one of the heat waves here
you are kidding
no
ooh
yeah
um July fourteenth they think he died
oh
from what they could tell
was he living by himself
yeah you know he always had been since Matt left
uhhuh
and he had this little house in south Omaha although he had air conditioning you know
Tom and I were talking about this he had air conditioning but I wonder if he didnt shut it off at night or something
uhhuh
and he because he died in the morning they think
oh wow
hm was he pretty old
yeah he was
uhhuh
he was
well was he has he just was he still drinking
no
oh he wasnt
he he quit drinking for some time but he was just you know hes a pretty crotchety cranky guy
yeah hm
old guy you know but
hm
still you know
yeah right
anyway Matt came back here but Matt didnt call me it was weird
Matt didnt call me I didnt hear from him or anything and he you know
hm
were not we are listed
yeah
and he had my old number but I dont know he was here for two weeks so
hm how did you find out
I didnt here from him Lisa Bradley
oh
Lisa Bradley called me just the other day and she goes did you hear about Matts dad and I was like no
0
and she heard from Maggie Maggie had called Lisa and Lisa had call me
mhm
so
hm
yeah that is kind of
so I sent him a card and stuff
mhm
hm
but I know how that is too youre so out of it when something like that happens that I
right
you know that thats unders
that right that you cant
thats understandable but I was kind of surprised
uhhuh
for him to have been here two weeks and I guess you know he was at the house
and moving stuff he took alotof stuff back they pretty much settled as much of the property as possible
mhm
right afterwards
well Matts where now Chicago
yeah
uhhuh
yeah
yeah
so anyway
yeah probably just
hm
but thats alri I mean you know we werent weve kind of been
he had alotof things to take care of and
weve kind of been drifting apart anyway over the last couple of years so
yeah
anyway but I sent him a card and stuff
uhhuh that was nice of you
yeah
mhm
yeah well thanks
huh
you said well thats nice I said well thanks
anyway so I just thought Id tell you that I dont know what else can I tell you
well
but anyway the surgery thing can I tell you one more time
mhm
it was cool because it was such an assembly line thing I couldnt believe how efficient they were
uhhuh
it was almost I mean it was almost fun you know youre in this dream state and you can kind of hear what theyre saying
I remember them saying oh this is much bigger ohmygosh we got to go through the bone
this is much bigger than we planned
they had to go yeah they had to go around the bone I guess there was another bone and
ew
it was weird my hand
did you feel like people were just like you werent there
I felt like it was you know what it was alot less of a problem than having my wisdom teeth out
uhhuh
oh and that that was alot worse than this
uhhuh
and you know and I wasnt in a surgery room or anything I mean this was full blown surgery they had monitors
on me and they were going to give me oxygen in case something went wrong because they were
jeez
they were concerned about that I mean it was pretty serious I guess but
uhhuh
but they put a tourniquet on my arm and it was it was weird it was weird but anyway what did you ask me
did you feel like you werent
you were just kind of observ
oh oh it was kind of like
I dont know it was it was
kind of like a kind of like a dream but thats not right kind of like when youre just waking up but you never just
hm distortion
quite wake up
mhm
your eyes are open you can hear things but they arent quite connecting
mhm
youre youre in slow motion thats I guess
like when you take alotof cold medicine
yeah
yeah there you go lot of cold medicine like
slow motion
is what it felt like
uhhuh
like okay
and it was funny but you know I everything was going really good until last night
uh Tom had his arm around me when we were watching that movie
0
and I kind of d I wanted to readjust
mhm
and I forgot that my hand doesnt really want to bend certain ways yet
mhm
and I did it anyway and it ohmygod and it it was it bruised
ooh
my fingers bruised something I must have
ouch
like broke some blood vessels but its I mean its O K its just weird
mhm mhm
its just weird to watch this heal
that would be kind of
its I mean I dont know
it would be kind of fun though Im like
it is kind of fun
you I kind of like to watch when bruises turn colors and
I well I mean w just the just the healing Im surprised my body is healing
0
y y considering Ive had that infection
mhm
below so f so long its that
yeah that youd actually get to observe something
something thats going to h work
going to heal its like
you know
cool
this is neat and then theres stitches it looks like a big chicken but its kind of cool
well I get the stitches out Thursday
uhhuh
so its goo its going really well
well thats good sounds like things are going better
well yeah I think it was good to have that done I think it was good to finally find a doctor that said yeah Im going to listen to you
mhm
and those kinds of things and then you know
mhm
and
and all I get along with
and then youre going on your trip
and I got a really good roommate and stuff
thats good
thats cool
Grittis pretty cool huh
Grittis neat
last night last night we sat outside it was really fun we we I dont know have you ever played cribbage
mm mm
I always thought you know its like this British kind of cribbage but
cribbage
Tom Tom kept bugging me the last couple of weeks he goes he goes
he goes would you be interested in learning cribbage Im like why do you play he goes yeah he goes I w I would think thatd be fun
so anyway we were last night we well we played a game in the morning and then
we didnt play again because it was so hot we had gone outside
uhhuh
and because we got this this thats right youve not been here we have a like a table outside its kind of cool on this deck
uhhuh
well anyway we were playing last night it was dark but we didnt want to put the bug light because you know
uhhuh
so it was it was we got we had we had chocolates and and and
God
water and we were just really decking it and we and I bought this candle holder thing its really neat
uhhuh
at a thrift store for fifty cents its like iron
uhhuh
and its for long stemmed candle you know like like not long stemmed candles thats roses long long you know what are they called taper candles
right like uhhuh
and so we put a bunch of those in there and we lit them
mhm
and it was really cool we were playing cribbage last night by candlelight we
played until like midnight or something
cool
yeah that was really fun
thats fun did you win
no
I suck I mean Im just learning but it w but I mean I didnt l I didnt lose bad or anything I was kind of
youre just learning
uhhuh
he didnt skunk me or nothing
mm
but it was it was so funny and we and and then we were worried about
I dont know its just funny because the neighbors
the the the deck itself has like
i i i i its just planks
mhm
and so we kept dropping stuff he first
gaw
hes first Tom he was like he was drinking beer and he spilled the beer
he goes I dont know whats wrong with me he goes Im not Italian I never do stuff like that
So what have you been up t
ah nothing really
Weve
yeah
Weve had a big change of leadership over here
oh yea
yeah the base C O changed
The clinic O I C changed
The clinic
C U nurse changed
And
just trying to get uh you know the feel for how everybody else is
you know going to respond to them and how theyre going to respond to
everybody else has been trying to say the least for the past oh probably month or so
yeah
So
Well I mean thats still a possibility
I mean I just didnt
yeah
feel like it was the right time when I was home last
So
I dont know I saw Sayonara again
I still see you with some little gal flying around going Karisan Karisan
The supper is ready
Get thy ass on the table
No
Nothing like that going on over here
yeah
Well Ill tell you another a y Did you hear about Martha getting marrie
No
Well this supposedly is going to happen
Now it hasnt actually happened yet
So e we may be at ground zero
I called her to to chat whether I guess about two weeks ago
um
And shed said oh hey Bill
By the way Im getting married This is a typical Martha pronouncement
Ye
Its like oh okay
uh you know e tell me about this guy
How long have you known him and all that
oh well Ive been dating him in since April
but I havent really told anybody
And I thought well this is true cause Martha you and I have been in pretty good touch since April and you never mentioned it
But this guy supposedly is a retired Marine pilot
um
He just retired out so hes kind of thinking what he wants to do now
I think for some reason the guy was an A six driver
And uh it seems like they just really hit it off and clicked
And I think he has one child but he doesnt have custody
um
So I dont have a whole lot of scoop on this guy
But they havent set a date or anything
They just decided they were going to get married and do it real informal and all this and
I know
So
I asked if he was drinking buddies with Luke and that didnt go over real good
So
So I dont know a whole lot of the scoop
But uh shes still in San Diego and seems to have settled pretty much there
uh
In mine uh Ive changed qui Im trying to remember
Last time I probably talked to you was what last sprin
yeah
I know were the were the worlds best at keeping in touch
Well Im on the road now moving from New Orleans
Im finally left The Big Easy and Im going up to believe it or not for graduate school
oh you are
yeah
I finally decided to go ahead and get on the ball
And I knew I wanted to teach English as a second language as a career but Id never really done anything about it
So I started doing it in New Orleans as a private tutor and then got picked up by a little private school down there to teach for a couple of months And knew this was what I wanted to do so I got it
I applied and got accepted into graduate school up in Vermont specializes in kicking you out into a one year Masters program
do that
So this starts in late August and Im on the way up there kind of meandering up to the states and seeing anybody and everybody
So if your dead old behind was in the States I could you know make a point to go by and find you but since youre still in
yeah
the land of large explosions I havent been able to do that
yeah
Well your tour is what three years Ker or did you get
No its only two
Ive only got about six months left over here
I was going to say I thought you were winding up
Do you know where youre going ye
yeah Twenty Nine Stumps
Youre kidding me
No
aw good deal
I think I know some folks out there
yeah well you know
I d I called the detailer and I had originally uh applied for a fellowship to work with the Joint Commission Accreditation Hospitals
mhm
Which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in Chicago which
the the town that they had this
fellowship in was
like five minutes from where I went to college and
Right
ten minutes from where I went to high school
Right
So I thought yeah itd be great
You know
But uh they picked some physician to go
yeah
So the only other choice they gave me was either uh Great Mistakes
mhm
or Twenty Nine Palms
mhm
And the detailer uh
I said well let me think about it for a while
An and probably forty five minutes after I hung up with her she called me back
and said that she had spoken to the director of nursing out at Twenty Nine Palms
mhm
and the director of nursing out there
wanted me
to be the department head for emergency nursing
Wow
So
I dont know this lady but you know Ive got my sub specialty in that and
Sure
with the experience that Ive got so
You know I eventually got back to her and said yeah Ill go ahead and go out there
yeah
Well I was going to say
Because I know youre still the lieutenant commander righ
yeah
okay
Ar are you looking towards ho how soon would commander be coming around the pike for you Kerr
ah well I would be in zone next next year
okay so that wouldnt blow the department head thing if you pick up commander would i
But
No no uh
But guess who got deep selected
For commande
yeah
Let me think
oh its got to be Barney
oh yeah
Well now I also heard
Now I think I heard this from Martha
I heard Barney had some kind of terminal disease
Well Barney has cancer
okay
uh he had some sort of uh
uh
mouth and throat cancer
yeah
You know hes a big golfer
Right
And golfers tend to when th after they tee off they stick their golf tee in their mout
oh no
yeah well they think that this cancer developed from the the bug spray and the weed killer that they put on the the grass
oh man
yeah so I I saw Barn I was back in the States in March
And uh
I saw Barney at this convention that I was at
yeah
And he was as skinny as you are
Youre kidding me
No
Good god
Cause he was always built like a seal or something
He was huge
yeah
And uh you know he had gone through chemotherapy and was in the process of getting radiation so he like had
you know one hair per
square inch on his head
yeah
And uh could barely talk because thats where they were focusing the radiation
Right
uh and he looked u he looked like death warmed over
You know he
yeah
You see the Auschwitz pictures and that was Barney
Barney Lipstien
yeah
yeah
But um yeah he worked for uh General
Krulac
okay
okay
You just said the magic words
So
mhm
I got you
yeah Ive got another buddy who uh is a marine pilot
Im trying to think if you had ever met
this guy
I dont think so
He um worked for him as an aide
And so he was chuckling the other day w well probably the other day the other year when he heard Krulac had been selected to be the next big boy
And he thought you know Bill whatever happens Im good to go now Im golden
oh yeah
yeah it was it was a real surprise to hear e and when I talked to Barney he wasnt
Wow
we didnt really spend a whole lot of time talking about the the cancer
yeah
yeah
But I I asked him I said you know I asked him point blank I said what was what the prognosis was
yeah
And he said poor
um but he didnt say terminal
yeah
um
okay I think I had kindof assumed that I guess from talking to Martha because she may have over glorified it
I dont know
Well you know
and Barneys wife Barb is down in Sansabel
mhm
And I talk to her fairly frequently
And she said that um
mhm
she just saw him a couple of months ago
mhm
And that he was starting to gain weight back again
So
Super
You know I dont know whether they managed to get all the cancer with the chemotherapy and the radiation or or what
yeah
But
You know I y I knew when the list came out I didnt even have to look you know because I knew that both Barney and I were um eligible
mhm
Not in zone but eligible

You know your sister was

Too bad
So is she home for goo

He took her bac
No
He didnt take her back but his mom was going to buy her a car
so that shed stay out there and sure enough shes staying out there
oh yeah
She working it
hu
She working it
So anyway she called me a couple days before she was going to come home and and I go
can you tell me why you would stay in a place where you know
youre not wanted
in a state you know that where you dont know hardly anybody
So then it thats when it all came out
She said well Pat I think her names Patty Pattys going to buy me a car
Shes going to help me out
I said
Kara you know why shes going to do that is because she wants
the kid to stay there so she can see your grandson
mhm
so she got all pissed off at me
I said youre being used
Youre being bought
Man she going to be like Jill become
I said why dont you
so I said why dont you stand up on your own two feet
She going to be like Jill and become a product of the state and shit live off welfare and god damn
Then you know what she said to m
What
She said
and this sounded just like something like uh her mother inlaw or w I dont know th what the hell relationsh it wouldnt be mother inlaw
What Drews mom
probably is saying to her
Kara says well I have to do whats right for David
oh
And I said no Kara you have to do whats right for Kara
And whats right for Kara will be right for David
Thats right
As long as you feed him love him and take care of him
oh well I dont want him to not know his daddy
Im like
Wh
I wouldnt I w I you know what I could never be with someone who didnt love me
Could yo
Hell no
I dont get that
I dont get that
Anyway so I spouted my mouth off
Well I
Good for you
I have to tell you the week before I met
uh
the sergeant and lieutenant at the Des Moines McDonalds
because they were dropping off Shawn
Sergeant and lieutenan
Jennings
hu
Sergeant and lieutenant Jennings
You talking about mom and da
yeah
eh heres why I call them that
So were sitting there in McDonalds p and Im they had Shawn for a week and were visiting and and they start in on me right away
And you keep your mouth shut and you dont say this and you dont say that and dont say this and dont say that
It was the whole time was was nothing but a big fucking lecture
You say oh Ive got to go
So I think I think I did that on purpose
Good for you
Well then the following weekend was fathers day
And we were supposed to all meet in Des M
oh that was to drop Shawn off
okay
yeah And then were going to meet and pick Shawn up and see Kara and David
Ive never seen that kid
Have no clue what he well you havent either
uhuh
So
we get there and theres dad with his hands in his pocket and he meets us out at the car and and
um mom was sitting on the bench for once not huddling around dad
And I said wheres Kara He said well she didnt come
And I said what
He said no she didnt come
She she didnt like the last two conversations that she had with you
She doesnt didnt like what you s you had to say to her
So they still backing her
And you want to know somethin
Wha
They probably told her it was okay not to come
They probably said yeah we dont like how she talks to us either
I bet what do you want to bet because
dont you think they could have made her com
yeah
They wouldve made anybody else come
Sure
They wouldve said get your ass in the car
Whether y
Say god damn we dont want to hear no fucking shit
Lets go
Whether youre thirty six or twenty six it dont matter
yeah
You wouldve been in that god damn car
Well
it was just like well well show her for spouting her mouth off
She wont get to see the baby
yeah
Exactly
Well punish her
So then he just calls
The old man just calls me and says
I got my messy mess message machine and says yeah we want to we want Ryan to come out
We dont think its fair that Ryan cant come out
And cause I I I said Im not going to meet them in Des Moines
I c I cant be with them Tad
I get I I lose two weeks of my life every time Im with them
Mentally I cant take it
Well why do you think nobody else has no
I I cant I cant do it anymore
contact with them
I I just cant
I mean that pissed me off the last time they were here so
But its never their fault
Its never for anything that theyve done
I know that and I mean i i you get blamed you still get blamed for shit and and lectured about shit that happens when youre a kid or or or whatever and all that I mean
Well I dont get it for that but so then dad dad says now why dont you want to go to DesMoines and I said because I dont
I said I thought wed already been through this cause I already told them I didnt want to go to DesMoines
And he goes well then well drive to Omaha and pick up sh Ryan and and then well bring him back and then well bring him back home to Omaha
And I said
mm
oh so youre not and the whole thing is that I wont let them stay in my house anymore
Because I cant have that twenty four hour bitching and negative
I cant
I cant live like that
yeah
yeah
You know what Im sayin
mhm
Its just twenty four hours
So I said so so let me understand this so youre coming youre picking him up and youre leavin
Youre not stayin
Right
And I go hm well it sounds like were back to the same old
argument And I said so youre going to punish me because youre offended that I dont particularly want you to stay here in my home
Well no its not punishing
I said well then what do you call it
I mean I just came out and said it
yeah
No you just dont un I said no dad
I think its you dont understand
You dont understand how you affect my family
You and mom
And and more importantly how you affect me And he said thats your problem
You think too much about yourself
And I said goodbye dad
hm
And I hung the phone up
Good for you
Why does why does our life have to be like thi
I dont get it
Well theyre the ones who created it
Theyre n
Why do they have to be like tha
I dont know and
Dad You know what I said to dad when he met me at the um when he came up to our door and said Karas not coming cause she doesnt like y you know what I said to him
Wha
I said I hope that my my sons never treat one another like this
True
I dont think my kids will be that way
And he just looked at me
Well youve got a point but
I see
I think
No I have to come back because I dont think all my stuff will fit in in our vehicles
So I have to come back
But yeah
huh
its alotof airport shenanigans
I was really upset
I didnt know
hu
I didnt know
yeah
Its not my fault
Its going to be awful
Wha
Its going to be awful this trip home
Wh
Because Im leaving here at
uhhuh
six in the evening
uhhuh
getting to SanFrancisco at uh eleven in the morning
uhhuh
and then hanging around the airport until kid Ted gets out of work
Wait a minute
The same morning isnt i
yeah
uhhuh
earlier
Hang around the airport until whe
Hanging around the airport until Ted gets out of work
um thats awful
Like six six hours later and then
mm
I think you should just come here
and then Sunday so I will have slept on the plane
mhm
The only sleep Ill have gotten is on the plane
uhhuh
And then Sunday night Im taking a redeye which leaves
At
at eleven fifteen
P
y yeah
Because you said redeye and then get there at
And arrive arrives in uh Chicago at four fifty seven
And then you go to Washington
The only sleep Ill get is from eleven fifteen to f to five in the morning honestly
Is this the one that goes to Washingto
um Chica no Chicago and then Syracuse
oh thats nice
My original one went my original one went to Washington and then Syra
Maybe you should take that one though because it comes earlier doesnt i
No it wasnt an option for some reason
oh
Maybe it was full or something
um but still maybe you know maybe you should just get on the next plane instead of waiting around for Ted
Youll be back here by the time he gets there
You would
yeah
yeah
Well maybe not because if connections cant go direct
Whine
um but youre going to go mountain bikin
Maybe
That would be fun
Does he have a mountain bike for yo
yeah
Does h
Well apparently because he offered
Because he offered yeah
And he I would imagine that he would know that youre not travelling around with your bicycle
Right
And that you dont get to keep the yours as a souvenir
Right
Or anything fun like that
its not a mountain bike
hu
and its not a mountain bike anyway
No and y in some of your letters it sounds like you wouldnt really want to
keep it really
Just
I did go up a mountain on it
But
hu
I did go up a mountain well not on it with it
oh
Pushing it
Do you have legs of stee
No
I have knees of pain
You have knees of pain you have ouchies
I forgot to delete e ouchies from

Did I tell you tha
And they said ouchies

And I yeah I explained a little bit
Trying very hard not to be silly
Its very its very difficult to explain this with any kind of straight face
reall
w I didnt mind that I was smiling but without like
y you cant e how do you explain i
Im very silly and I I s I say ouchies because
it it
its ah
And the funny thing is it was Becky that questions it
Because Becky speaks such you know standard English
She speaks stand standard English
Right
Standard vocabulary
but but ouchies just really struck her as something very odd
He yeah
And wh my other thing to tell you wha

So
I dont what do you thin
It it sounds a little scary to drive you know in your car
Alone at night

That far
yeah
So maybe I should wait until tomorrow
But I dont see the other thing is I dont know when theyre coming back tomorrow

Mayb

Maybe maybe you should check out your check out your biorhythms
ah okay
So how are you how are things goin
um oh Joseph I dont know
It I like what Im doing but I am so isolated
And this is this is like the best present Ive had the whole year Ive been here
Youre kiddin
Because I dont have anyone to talk to
oh come on youre kidding righ
w
No Im not kidding
It is so hard to talk to people here
You mean like like Scottish folk
Then
well the br just the British in general
I find them very sort of really reserved
And they you know how Americans just kind of jump in and oh hi lets be friends kind of thing
You know were stuck in the in a horrible situation together so lets laugh
uhhuh
And and the British dont jump in right away and I mean
once they make friends with you then theyre nice to you
But I dont know what the secret is of cracking the code
You know
So
uhhuh
And you havent cracked it with anybody ye
Well I mean partly is I partly Im so busy
ohgod this course Joseph was so overwhelming this year
Wow
I mean w e we were in class about six hours a day and then you had to go home and do about twenty five hours worth of homework to to get ready for the next day Just you know

ohmygod
That must have been hellish
They wr yeah they wrote h he wrote a book about it
hm
So
Is he America
No hes br hes English
uhhuh interesting so her Arabic must be really good
Its pretty good
Its not any better than mine
Well your Arabic is really good
Its its a its gotten pretty good actually
Ive learned some interesting stuff here this year
Are you doing simultaneous stuf
No were not doing any simultaneous
Why no
Not at all Because um you ha I think you have you have to for one thing you have to be alot better at Arabic than I am to do it
But um mostly were we spend most of our time on translation
hm
And only a very little bit on interpreting
And the interpreting we do is is a consecutive liaison interpreting
What does that mea
It means that um you you actually it it well you you do it by paragraph
mhm
Small small sort of small bits of speech
And in some ways its harder than simultaneous
um because you have to not only remember what was said but you have to get all the facts right you kno
You ha
Right right
Youve got to remember it all and
yeah all the dates and amounts and you know
So theres a theres alotof practice in note taking and devising your own sort of set of symbols that will jog your memory
mhm
you know because you cant you cant keep notes on a whole paragraph of what somebody says
Right
You cant you just cant do it
wow very nice
its really sweet
fast
yeah it is
wow
certainly is
so hows your family
yeah everybody is cool man I went home
Hows your da

right right
you know
and thank god hes never on those
uh I thought that was sugar
oh yes sorry sugar thats right
yeah
yeah you got to watch the sugar
mhm
but he also has high blood pressure so
hes got to watch the salt too

like the money that they were receiving
right
like aid or something it got cut off because
uhhuh
from Temple

you know its like you got to you know like the Pakistani woman man

and
you know
yeah
I dont know if how close he was with his dad if he know if he knew all that stuff

hm
So hows everybody else your your sister your brother
yeah theyre all fine
Possum is
is he hows hes his remember
his gonads are working good now
theyre
little accident
the stitches are as the stitches are ge are slowly coming out again
like they did theyre supposed to fall off you know
He still has stitches there
right they they come out though you know
I mean its been a while its been months
Itll take
yeah itll take six months before everything is totally healed
wow
and then he has another checkup with the
a surgeon
who did the surgery to check him out you know to make sure everything is cool
mhm
and like it wasnt
from what I understand from speaking to the doctor it wasnt life threatening
mhm
it was just that he couldnt reproduce you know if something serious happened
sh that sucks dude
and that would be you know for a
for a guy that hurts
yeah oh yeah
but that you know thats good
is is your s or no thats that
dude did I tell you I got my bill
for what oh your hand
my hand
No what how much
twelve hundred bucks
Wha
twelve hundred bucks
eh does your insurance cover it
what happened was they sent me
like you know like Im s
like they were trying to justify by saying like i
like lets say you have a problem Mike
mhm
the first thing you do like they have rules you know they dont just pay for everything they have rules you got to follow the rules
I think that must have been before I went on the riverboat
cruise they have a cruise on sunday nights
yeah
and they have
they get local bands to come on and they charge you ten dollars you know and
it was this one band that Dennis knows a lot of the people in it you know so he had
told me about it and so I went with him and some of his friends and
it was really nice it was really relaxing it was
kind of a a
more of a family atmosphere than going
you know
to a bar to listen to these people perform because they their families came
on the cruise for the most part you know they had their parents and their grandparents and their brothers and their sisters and their
nieces and nephews you know and
and other people brought their children to it
it starts
the boat leaves about seven and its all over by about ten oclock so its not a late evening you know
mhm
and I like the music and
it was just
its been so hot its really pleasant to go out on the water
yeah
they had
the main
deck they had the air conditioning on
but later on
during a break I
went outside and just stood on the deck for a while and watched the sunset
and
you know felt the the breeze and everything and
it was just so peaceful it was like
one of those rare moments of pure serenity
mhm
it was really
pleasant
I really liked it
has it been real hot again since I left
since a week
it has been some days yesterday was bad
and
it hasnt rained a drop
actually I think it rained a little bit
way out in west Omaha
but not enough to really do anything you know
mhm
anyhow so that was fun I did that and
I enjoyed that a lot then
I worked all day saturday because I wanted to take some time off this
this week for my birthday just to try to catch up on the things that
I cant get done when Im working and
because its kind of nice to have some time to yourself you know
yeah
its kind of a treat for me to be off on my birthday and
Ive had a lot of work to do
and the only way I could really
get this week off was
you know to to work all day saturday
tell them that the project was ready to go and
I dont think there going to have any problems while Im gone
I told my boss to call me if they did and I would come in but
I dont think he would call anyway he doesnt like to bother people when theyve got time scheduled off
mhm
but I I really dont think theyre going to have any problems he
he told me that
they
you know they were so concerned
they pushed my due date up a week they you know moved it advanced it a week
and then they wanted to push it up further
and I told them
it couldnt be done any quicker if they wanted it tested
so and you know he
backed me up on that he
figured they didnt really need it that soon anyway I think
and monday he told me that they really werent ready to use it
after all that fuss and you know that they did
to
get it done
mhm
so anyhow
I dont care its its thats fine with me Id just as soon that
I was waiting on them than I dont like to have them waiting on me you know
yeah
so I Ill go back to work friday
and
well see whether or not theyve caught up a little bit or anything
and what else
I havent been out to pick up the mail
because its so hot I didnt want to go out
so I dont know if I got any birthday cards or not
well we just got our cards in the mail so
well I usually get interesting cards on my birthday from
uhhuh
you know people in other parts of the states
but so I usually kind of look forward to it but I have this weird thing on the back of my neck
And they still have just one daughte
Yes and I think thats probably all because I think Carl feels like people like me overpopulate the world
I have three sons now
Reall
yeah
gosh
And
uh All boy
Yes
No girls
ohmygosh oh thats so interesting and you know Jas ah Jasmine and Sophie are taking swimming classes with Winston and I was
oh are the
yeah and I was thinking of asking him for your address and I thought no hes so forgetful hell never remember
Its not worth it
Well he he never would or he he he wouldnt know how to you know he wouldnt know how to get it
I
I used to call him
Well just just Winston I know you kno
I used to call him every once in a while but their niece like shes I think shes the oldest of all the
Reall
uhhuh
of all the kids the one whose I dont know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in Nicaragua fighting but anyway
No
she was living in the house and shes kind of
I dont know all I know I dont know if she wouldve been this way if she hadnt had all the problems she had in her life but shes kindof a goofball and she ran up such big bills that I dont think theyve had a phone for a whole year
because he cant pay them off but and I dont know if shes still living there or not
But I can give you my address yeah
Wow
huh
yeah Id love Id yeah
Im so gla you know how I have your numbe
I s I
I was wondering about that
You talked to Dunya
No no well I did talk to Dunya but she didnt give well actually she wasnt there the day I called I talked to Ralph but um the last time I was in Honduras which is nearing two years
Its going to be two years in January
um I saw your husband I was as I was leaving the airport
and i I had my billfold out and he wrote it on this little pad in my billfold and you know wha
I dont have alotof things but I still have that
ohmygosh and I dont remember
So I thought well Im going to advantage of it
So
ah and I dont remember him telling me that he saw you
oh he probably spaced it he was I think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something maybe where you
picking up people from Peace Corps probably yeah
Something like that yeah but that was right af I mean thats a long time ago that was right after the the change of the government
We were down because of that
huh
So anyway
So three boys Barb
yeah
Wow
My hands are so full
yeah I remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order
Well if I wanted to have a child I should do it you know and so that pushed me
He said that we dont want you to have a baby if its going to create problems but if you want to have one this is the time and it actually
so you went all out
oh thats what it was
did turn everything around for me
I dont know if it works that way for everybody but those hormones
kind of took care of the problems I was having
I was starting to have the problem again befo like it was only maybe three months afterwards I got pregnant but I could already feel the pains and all that so
Wow
I wa I felt so good when I was pregnant I just felt like it was a miracle and then
Reall
oh yeah and then breast feeding those hormones also helped so I feel just fine
I hope I hope I never have to deal with endometriosis again but who knows after three
So your first boy is Joel or Noe
Noel Noel or Noel
Noel
And hes seven and a half
Thats how long ago that was
We probably
uhhuh
Seven and a half
We havent seen each other s
yeah in a long time uhhuh
And your other two boy
Because
um Thomas is three
uhhu
Its Thomas Enrique is his full name
And then I have a baby whos just going to turn ten months
oh really
And whats the babys nam
h Thats Logan Andres
ah
oh how nice
So are you going to keep goin
or
so
and you two girls
oh ah well I r I t I thought I was done really after Thomas not that I think two is the perfect number but I didnt expect to get pregnant a third time I it just kind of that happened when I was in Honduras last time that was really so
mhm
i I was so angry at Oscar that I just knew there was no way that I could ever even think of going to bed with him you know
So and thats when it happened but I love my little baby and
huh
yeah
but
And youre still with Oscar right thats
well were still married but hes doing his own thing like usual so I pretty much take care of the crew all alone
He calls to see how theyre doing and
huh
pops in every once in a while but its tough
It really is and see his daughter lives here too
wow
shes
She doe
Well she has since
well I think theyve been here five years now five years this summer because we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship
Both Oscar and Lehia um
Hes twenty and shes just turned eighteen now
Wow
he doesnt live here um
He had kind of well so its a long long story but at one point
when I got real irritated with Oscar everybody in the family insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his children which you know I really believed when I was there and I and i I mean it does make alotof
intellectual sense I guess
But it really I didnt want to do that to the kids but I did and so I sent them to stay with him and then
I felt bad about it immediately and then he wouldnt let them come back and so it turned into a situation where Lehia was really the one that wanted to come back and Oscar junior kind of decided that living with his father was what he wanted
mhm
And Lehias mom used to beg him to let her come back and hed say yes and then hed hang up the phone and hed say Id never let you go back there you know I mean it was real stupid
It wasnt really that he wanted her around but it was just it I dont know
People do stupid things
hm
oh
hm so theyre living with hi
No now how lon
Probably two years ago then we she and I worked it out where I got power of attorney from her mom because her mom always had custody and she called me one day when
there was nobody in the house but her and I drove and got her and kind of stole her back it was kind of exciting I couldnt believe that Id ever do that but oh well it was very exciting actually because
ohmygosh
I mean I had to drive like two and half hours so we you know you didnt know at any moment somebody might be coming home
I said get your stuff ready and I called her when I got to the corner you know it was it was really something and we just packed the car full
I mean theres wasnt one inch of space left and then we just flew out of there and we went to the nearest McDonalds to kind of repack where we could breathe easy
ohmygosh
It was pretty funny and then you know he never said a thing about it
yeah he
hm
you know hed I know that he knew she was better off here
and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once but you know he doesnt even know any of it because its not that he doesnt care about his kids but hes not really capable of being a father
You know he just
hm
close
So whats Lehia doin
Is she studying or did she already graduate high schoo
Shes going to be in her last year of high school
uhhuh
And shes been with her mom for two months so shell be coming back tomorrow
um
ah
so its thats thats what we have here and then Oscar junior has in the last year he was he graduated one year ago from high school and he started going to school in Missouri and
then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to Omaha and go to school here which was really surprising and that he was kind of saying that it living with his father wasnt what he you know he kind of had
his opinion on it has had changed but they wanted to live in an apartment
They didnt want to burden me anymore were his words but you know I know its that they want they want freedom which is great
Theyre twenty you know
hm
yeah
So they just moved in about oh four blocks well no maybe farther about a mile from us they live
Wow
in an apartment and thats going to be really I hope its going to be nice
His buddy is here actually and Oscar is finishing some work that he was doing and then hes coming up sometime next week
yeah
but that thats kind of in a nutshell all the things that have been going on and
Wow
I
Well its interesting
Are you working or are you teachin
oh yes
Well I dont teach I
yea
lets see well I came back I I taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job in home ec which is its probably still that way and I went for my masters in counseling
and
uhhuh
um
actually I was asked to come back and be the counselor at the American school and that was the year I was pregnant with Noel and I was really torn I didnt know what to do
but my doctor didnt want me to go back to Honduras because Id been so sick before
He felt that y
mhm
I really needed
We didnt know how the pregnancy was going to go but I I feel like I really I mean I wasnt really paying that much attention to what he said but that did influence a little bit
so I didnt go
hm
and uh lets see what would I I guess I was working part time that year doing part time counseling jobs and then that next year I had two o well I had one offer that I had to take
The other one was we were waiting for a principal to come back
mhm
but I ended up
I wanted to go into high school counseling but I couldnt because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he c had to make the decision its like oh
I need th I need this need to know fast because Im pregnant and I cannot you know risk losing a job
So I ended up working at the
Sure
community college which wasnt what I wanted at the time but a as its turned out it probably was the best and I like it real well
I l I was cou I counseled for about five years and now Im in administration
oh great
really
yeah raining and thunderstorms and stuff like that
oh gosh it is blistering down here just so hot
so
its been hotter than the dickens but it its been and weve been having severe thunderstorms and tornadoes all over the place

mhm
it was just awful I mean there was trees down there was branches all over theres still and the roads are just
cluttered with debris branches and
oh wow
you know
stuff
but I dont know I think it might have been a twister that maybe just didnt touch all the way down
mhm
or something
but
we didnt have any trees so we dont didnt lose anything
so thats okay
Did you get those trees taken out

that person behind was there for the ride
oh I know good
So going uphill was just
oh horrendous huh

uhhuh
so that was fine
wow
but then we we we only wanted to to do an hour
you know because otherwise it costs costs more

It was nice we were originally planning to stay one more day like through Friday

yeah
but we had seen enough
yeah
of the area
and actually we were kind of ready to come home
yeah its kind of you get home a little earl
all the clothes were dirty
yeah
the flies were just horrible biting
oh really
yeah
but we swam in swam in Lake Michigan
how about
Lake Huron and Lake Superior
not Bertland
no because
only because you know
the public beach is kind of hard to find
oh really
I mean I didnt I didnt know where it was
we had never been to the public beach because we always went to the pastors or whatever his name was
didnt we
oh thats right I forgot didnt we
wasnt that the pastor
I think so
or his friends or something so somebody from the church
yeah thats right
hm anyway
yeah
oh well
yeah
so
mhm thats cool
anyway nobody did swimming but like but we think we might go back some time
that would be nice
yeah
well
yeah
well I sent yo I set something with Joanna for you
oh you did
yes in memory of the garden that we attempted to plant
oh what was it
cucumbers
oh did you make its hummus here
yes
thanks
got whole patch of little cucumbers and I have green beans and Im going to be getting squash and I just got a couple tomatoes
oh excellent
yes so I sent you some cucumbers
oh thanks thats really great
yeah hopefully you like cucumbers still
oh yes we do I do
good
yes
so
yay thats nice
one one of the larger ones might have a few
a couple little bite marks in it because Bethany was carrying it around thinking it was a melon and taking some
attempting to take some bites off of it
she thought it was a melon
yeah
she had it and she goes melon melon shes walking around and
shed take a little bite out of it and make a funny face and then go mm melon
is she in bed
yeah
yeah
she was so tired today she went to bed at she went to sleep at seven fifteen
youre kidding
no I just hope she doesnt wake up at some
hour in the morning
no kidding
but she does I I guess Ill get up
wow
oh
he was really tired though
yeah
but we got to bed pretty late
but was she good
yeah she was very good I I think shes cutting some more teeth so shes been
not crabby but
uhhuh
just
chewing on things and just a little bit
theres nothing that its like someone smoking or any other addiction
that
the
addict has to be willing and and want to give it up
but I mean it wasnt like we ever showed up at their house or they showed up at our house and he was drunk you know
right
he wasnt
right
he acted normal he always acted normal when he left
mhm
no it wasnt like he was falling over
right
you know like Mikes friend Jimmy
it was obvious
hm
yeah
he couldnt handle his liquor you know and
it was obvious
right
from the beginning and he you know
he drank
ten beers at a shot
yeah
well there are some alcoholics who are able to conceal it better than others who
you know
takes more to affect them
so that its obvious to others
hm
oh it explains alotof the odd behavior
eh you know like Jane would say that
he he took alotof sick days
mhm
and
she sai i
I dont know
you know its just like I cant understand why she never told me
all this time
well thats thats something thats very hard to share with anybody and its the kind of thing you really
oh were such close friends though but I mean you know up until
yeah
two months ago were still going over each others we just didnt do it much this summer
mhm
but you know wed go to their house and theyd open up a bottle of wine
mhm
you know why continue if theyre going to Alcohols Anonymous for five years
yeah
why do that with close friends
right then dont serve it sure
or dont serve it or
say you know Im not we wouldve sort of gotten the clue
mhm mhm
after a while when they didnt want to drink any wine at our house or
sure
you know he didnt have to say it
but why continue serving it at dinner
right
yeah thats just a part
to everybody
right
you know
right thats a strange thing that they continue to serve it and
you know
you know KimJoyHumphries eh what became an alcoholic
and the last time he came to our house
as they walked in she walked in first and Berl stopped me at the door he said
dont serve any li any liquor
dont even offer it
yeah
so you know that
yeah
I mean were
friendly with Jimmy and we dont drink around him
right
you know we dont have anything he doesnt have anything
mhm
mhm
why tempt him you know were not going to sit here and have a beer in front of him he cant drink
yeah
sure
right right
why wouldnt they
tell us to try to help them with this pro you know
yeah
who knows but
I dont know
that theyre I guess they f probably felt it was a terrible
shame and disgrace and maybe it was just
but thats foolish because you certainly should
share these things with your friends so that they can help you with it rather than
continue to
use it and abuse it you know
ha
Im sorry to hear that
I hope certainly hope hell make it
but said you know like he used to take sick days all the time
mhm
he hes been doing this f forever
yeah
and
she said oh he seems to catch everything the kids get
mhm
I mean whatever she didnt realize that he was
yeah
you know
honey
wha you just deny it to yourself too
but
yeah I mean I was up there last week with her
in New Hampshire
mhm
and its she said you know Ive been counting up the number of sick days that Gary has taken since the beginning of the year hes taken twelve sick days
mm
and he always took sick days when she was working and the kids were at day care
mhm
mm
and I you know Im thinking to myself gee he must really need
a break
yeah
you know maybe he just wants the house to himself and cant tolerate
mhm
you know
having to go to work and always have people around having to be home and always have p you know maybe he just needs days
mhm
to himself maybe this is just too much
you know three kids is too much for him or something Im thinking i
right
family stress I didnt think it was
mhm
because he was drinking or hung over or
right
whatever
right
yeah that
its not the kind of thing that pops into y into your mind as as being a fairly common
although Im sure its much more common
than what
we all know
but
it isnt the first thing that you think about when you hear about someone
taking sick days you think theyre sick
mm
oh she always used to complain that he worked till nine oclock at night and Mike and I used to say boy he you know
mhm
whats going on that he cant manage his work load
mhm
you know if hes there from ni how can anyone work from nine in the morning till nine at night five days a week
mhm yeah
and get home at ten oclock were like you know
right
obviously
either cant manage his work load or
mhm
you know we just couldnt understand it
yeah
but
he was probably going
he was probably going out drinking
to a bar
yeah
yeah
so maybe she didnt know
mhm
you know
right
I mean she knew enough to know he was an alcoholic and to
have him get help
mhm
and to go to Al and she said you know lately its gotten so bad that he was
seeing one on one a
therapist
mhm
but
I dont know its they said the next forty eight hours is critical
oh dear thats really a shame
oh were just hoping he makes it through
sure
sure
is he around your age
or is he older
yeah thirty nine
mm
yeah thats really rough
yeah
sorry to hear that
its not like hes Mickey Mantle on sixty three
well
hm
yeah
you know
yeah
well but
its no good at any age no matter what
no
you know some people catch it up with the earlier I suppose
huh
anyway how was your trip home last night okay
yeah
yesterday afternoon
it was fine both of the kids were sleeping when we we went by exit twelve
oh
oh
phew
we ended up at actually a really good place called the Blue Colony Diner
oh yeah exit ten
oh yeah weve been there
yeah
yeah
mhm
uhhuh because they were both awake and
yeah
yeah
weve stopped there
yeah
mhm
it was good
yeah
oh because
it used to be very good
uh we we used to stop there all the all the time on the way up to Jens
and then a couple times
we tried it
and
the service wasnt too great and some of the things we ordered were just not
particularly good so we
stopped going there but
oh
oh I guess its better
again
Well it was jam packed
mhm
and they were moving people in and out
yeah
and the waitress came and Im kind of looking around thinking gee this is going to be
mhm
you know
yeah
she came
I said to Mike we better order when she first gets here
right
because were not going to see her again
she came two minutes later she brought the drinks back
uhhuh
like within ten minutes she had our dinners our lunches there
mhm
oh good
so
yeah
that was good and
I had a Reuben
uhhuh
which was a little bit greasy
uhhuh
right
it was good
yeah
and Mike had
I dont remember what he had but it was good too
mhm good
good well well have to try it again then
if were in the vicinity
yeah
yeah
try
How was Dannys thing
so
It was nice
oh it was very nice

uh
we got there
oh a few minutes after twelve and they
first they served
sh platters of shrimp
shrimp cocktail
and they kept replenishing them which was very nice
and cheese and
crackers
and the dip
and a dip
with veggies
and then they had
lunch they served lunch about oh one thirty or two oclock maybe
mhm

salad
and then they had
they had eh
the congratulations cake for
Danny and Julie and they there were also three people celebrating anniversaries in in Annes family so she had three
separate little cakes for them too
mhm
and so it was very nice we had
very nice time
the crowd
yeah yeah she
oh how many people were there
uh
mm
hundred
oh wow
you think
ten tables I think
and eight around a table well eh between eighty and a hundred yeah
yeah
huh
mhm
Did you know the people you were with
guess
yes
um we were with
well
Debra Nells David Nells
uh you know is
mhm
our f our physician
he was supposed to come but he apparently had an emergency up at the hospital
oh
and he never made it
and
two other Jerry Kesselman
uh his wife was is away and
um
I dont think you know Bob Markwardt anyway his wife also was away so they were there and
um Freddies brother Sandy
mhm
and Phyllis his wife Phyllis were there at our table
oh
so yeah it was very nice
we met alotof other people we hadnt seen in a while it was
uh
it was very pleasant
was Suzanne there
no
no
she probably will come in for the wedding but shes out in California now
When is the wedding
March
oh
uh
and shes only been there
you know couple months so
yeah
when you start a new job you cant really
take that much time to go back and forth
right
especially f you know
uh
a wedding they would but
just the
engagement party
and unfortunately Ruth Mandel was in the hospital
She gave me actually not the eh the not a hundred and twenty days
She g I got it she what do you call it what do you she first class mail whatever you call it
Registered whatever yeah
or yeah and eh it was never it was like two weeks ago and Im supposed to have like a hundred and twenty days and I only have sixty days and thats not really fair and
oh I didnt yeah I didnt realize that there was a that there was a I mean because Ive always had trouble with my landlords so Ive never I mean so Ive always been sort of aware that whenever Ive left that theres that anxiety and you probably when you left
first of all you didnt know you were going to stay there
yeah exactly
second of all you know its like it all sort of like ends up I can understand that I can I can underst because that makes you feel like youre making a choice that
yeah
Its like a a c a yeah a big cut and everything and I mean I I dont know if its worth kee I mean Im like okay the maybe Ill then Ill never be able to go back you know but Ill
yeah
But thats not true
yeah
that you wouldnt ever be able to go back because you know that you know w as
Others possibilities
y you know
you could find another place to live I mean people are still finding like you know I know of people that are still finding like lofts in Brooklyn w in Williamsburg that are like cheaper that would be the kind of thing that you might want to change your living situation anyhow
And I dont think
Im still yeah
yeah eh eh eh yeah its just letting go I have problems letting I mean Ive had it for so long you know Ive lived there
yeah no I know
but its yeah I dont think its that w you know its worth h I mean I dont I you know a week before Im saying thinking to myself well if I ever move back to Man you know the c New York I dont want to live in Brooklyn anymore
oh right right
and so I then I you know this power of thought thing but otherwise Im you know Im okay I just I think I need some sort of
change or something I need a cha you know either Im bored uh you know with what Im doing not with what Im doing so much with art but with my life that I need some sort of
I need to have some you know physical change or visual change because its you know I need Ive just been working and um
Are you still doing like the set painting to make mone
yeah I its been great but I I didnt get I thought Id have more work this month than I did and so I dont have as much as I would thought I would have because I really want to buy
a laptop and I need it really badly its like ridiculous now I mean Im doing all this writing and I go you know to different peoples houses and its this yeah it would be I mean its a luxury definitely but its I definitely could use it
Well its a tool its a tool yeah
yeah its a great tool
And how are yo
How

How you doing Gai
Wait wait wait lets get caught up on you first

Hows the gig out ther
Well okay its m its mixed i no i yeah and no its good its bad its its weird its its definitely like first of all um
is it weird
like I came Ive been out here for about six weeks now
Its taking me a while to settle in
its definitely like
Hot
oh man its horrible its so disgusting and
I mean I hear weather reports for there Im like oh gee
I know and I wake up in the morning and its overcast and the sun doesnt shine
The thing is in NewYork city it might be hot but at least like the sun is shining or youll get like those big
yeah
those big city breezes like coming in off the water you know what I mean
Those big city bre yes I do you get some
You know what I mean right and here like the air doesnt even move like youre so lucky and then eh it moves like th therell be a thunderstorm in the afternoon
And everybody runs out to try to get some air
and its like and then its gone and then its like its the the the oppression is there again yeah exactly and its like all this steam rising off the ground
oh hotter
but okay so I dont like the weather and I think that I feel like Im in the suburbs because I dont have a car and I feel like I need a car to get around to the places that I need to get to because eh
things are so sort of scattered around theyre like its like being like at McDowell but without the but without the you know the fact that like somebody goes on a daily basis into town or you know those kind of things its its definitely like a
yeah sure of course
ohgod
yeah sure
Cant you get a really cheap on
Well Im thinking
Like a bunch of yeah a group of yo
yeah yeah Im thinking about getting a junk mobile
I was thinking about g I wanted to get like a ca like a real like something that I could have for a couple of years or something like that
That would be great
and Ive been looking around and I havent really seen anything oh excuse me
Ive gotten into this bad habit of remember when I was an undergrad and I used to watch Star Trek reruns
and the Twilight Zone
oh really your watching
Im watching Star Trek reruns at midnight because theres this
Thats great
guy that that that Ive gotten to be friends with or a couple of people that Ive gotten to be friends with actually they watch Star Trek at midnight like reruns all the time
Not the Next Generation though
um
Youre not into that
Star Trek the it is well its the one with Captain Picard
mm
I dont know which one that is
Thats the yeah thats the earlier one
I like the new one Next Generation thats pretty cool you should look into it
uhhuh
Anyway
Youre so bad Anyway so so thats why Im yawning but anyway what was I going to say
so it took me a while to settle in because and i and Im still not totally settled in
Ive started to do s some work
I did the first month that I was here I took a class in digital music which is like electronic you know like music editing and stuff like that
oh cool
mhm
oh thats great
And because Ive been w you know working with sound and Im interested in working more with sound and stuff and so that was really good we there was a concert at the end of it and I felt
thats great
pretty good about my contribution to that like it wasnt really exactly what I would want but I felt like like I
oh thats great
yeah so that was g that was good that was something that you know like y being here gave me access to
Im also learning alot about computers like
like about other things about computers like about you know how to do email and how to do like
Emails interesting
networking yeah yeah I mean if you get if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have
I may have to
well I mean like I have a lapt I have a an email address
I dont know who else that you know has an email address but its the kind of thing that I would like Im trying to t
You can get contact with people easy
yeah Im trying to like tell people because it only costs like a local phone call like if you if you call NewYork I mean if you wanted to write to somebody in NewYork you could like you could like type it up
Its like a eh a fax thing
yeah its but its better its even cheaper than a fax I think because its
yeah and it it goes into the computer its not like with paper
Right its not with paper but its and its cheaper because its c its the cost of a local phone call whereas a fax takes the amount of time that the that the phone call
oh thats great
No its really great and then you can get access to all any as any information you really need I mean if you needed something about research or whatever you
Right right yeah
This is amazing to me
yeah so yeah like the internet and all that kind of stuff so thats thats like so Im learning about that so thats kind of cool and then
Thats great
and Im supposed to start teaching in September
I mean Im a little bit nervous about that because I have to still put together a s like a course syllabus and
Joan get to work its two weeks away

Lord
yeah no its its n yeah I th
I dont I dont you know I I dont think its going to be a big deal I really kind of st doubt that Michelle will
will be ready to go you know she was already talking about sort of middle of September
um in the beginning of the spring
ohgod
yeah but shes c she couldnt shes got more leeway than you I think
yeah but Ive got so much more going for me than she does
I know
You know in the in the larger scheme
If they dont tenure you well sue them
We wont sue them but no anyway so
Itll work out but anyway Im Im so Im I I mean I caught myself today just getting a little sort of
Edgy
yeah
Well look
But but
If you change your mind and you want to just come right up to Windsor and finesse the move we can do that
No
No I dont want to do that
I dont want to do that
Itll because I itll be better to do the move right away anyway because Im I you know I cant come home and go right to work I just cant do that
Youll be exhausted yeah
yeah and I wont want to do it
I wont be able to concentrate
Right whereas we can do things
Whereas spending together time together
and moving and settling in
while moving is is fine
yeah
yeah
All right well
I g I guess well have to figure out our respective movements when when it gets closer but Im going to Ashfield with Greg
uhhuh
tomorrow
uhhuh
And
Stay up ther
Well Greg and Jim Jimco and the kids are leaving for Japan tomorrow
uhhuh
and
uh Gregs going to go up on a hiking trip with a friend
uhhuh
but hes going to
stop by Ashfield to drop off the dogs
uhhuh
So he can take me and the baby up
uhhuh
and then Ill maybe come back down with him hes coming back down I guess ten days later
uhhuh
I mean hes not staying the whole time but hell come back the last weekend of the month I think they said
uhhuh
and then go back down to NewYork and he can probably take us then because its gotten to be I just moving on my own is just very very difficult
No stay up there
um well and Im going to try and get back to work on my paper which is just ridiculous but
yeah
uhhuh
Im going to make an effort
Well we can both make an effort you know you can Ill finish my book you finish your paper you know
yeah
if you if you havent already
Although you know Cuny classes start really early
uhhuh yeah but then dont you have all those holidays right at the beginnin
Thats true
Thats a good point
I should really use those shouldnt
yeah
I havent lone lined up any child care yet Im being really flaky about it and I know Im going to hate myself later
You know I really ought to take the semester off
but did I tell you this is the last year of the
i is that for sur
Its not for sure yet but
uhhuh
um but theyve sent Cuny a letter
uhhuh
saying that the President did not
ask for funding for it in his budget
uhhuh
and it looks quite doubtful that the Senate is going to want to put it back in
uhhuh
um
so that Cuny thinks that this is the last year of it so Im reluctant to take a semester off
uhhuh
considering that it that I would only then have one semester left
Well anyway t you know this is not going I mean apart from the tenure and the book
you know this is not going to be a killing term for me
Im only teaching one class
and Ive taught it before
uhhuh
so you know and and I and I
Well once your tenure file goes in Ill be ready to believe that but until you get it in I I dont think you should have I think you should have
you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together
Obvious
Thats like critical for us
yeah yeah
So I dont want you to fee I dont want you to take on a alotof extra stuff at the beginning because
well I
it doesnt make sense
yeah
w believe me dear once you have tenure I will have no mercy
Good good
Especially because youre going to be away every summer youre really going to have to do alotof
yeah
youre going to have to take alotof responsibility during the year to make me feel like things are at all equal
Right
But not this not immediately this semester just because
okay
you that you know youve youve got a child now
Thats right
Youve got to get tenure
Thats right
So what was it what was your trip in what was the time in New Mexico lik
So
ohgod it was horrible
Reall
It was horrible
Wh
I cant i I was so tense and the baby was so unhappy
because because you were tense
and I think she just
I think thats what it is
yeah sure
because the minute I got here I relaxed completely and shes been just an angel
yeah but I mean that that makes perfect sense
yeah I know it does
Like dogs
yeah
yeah
It was awful th w you know we may get cut off at some moment so
uhhuh
if we do you know Ill Ill call you when I get to Ashfield
okay
um
it was just awful they I was stuck up on that hill they only had the Legend
uhhuh
and I had I they kept telling me I didnt need to rent a car which I absolutely did
uhhuh
um so anyway I didnt have my own transportation
uhhuh
They were buying a house
They have now bought a house
So they were just out driving around all day
They were completely stressed out
They had finished looking by the time I had got there but they were debating they were making a trying to make an offer
uhhuh
and Alexis you know has no confidence about this
uhhuh
and he had the most ridiculous realtor youve ever seen
uhhuh
um and he hates owning property and he and he could only buy a house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was
0
about half of what he wanted to spend
and he was a wreck
uhhuh
and then Joel showed up
uhhuh
Jemma was there and mom was picking on Jemma like she always does even though Jemmas a doll
uhhuh
Joel then turned up the day after I arrived and drove us mad
Drove us crazy
He was more obnoxious than hes ever been
uhhuh how do you kno
You havent seen him in ages
Well Jemma said so
I think I have greater tolerance for Joel than anyone in your family does
I think you do
I think you do but he really was he really was a pain in the neck and Jemma said its because his girlfriend just dumped him
uhhuh uhhuh
um but anyway so mom and Alexis were freaking out because of that but they have no ability to set any limits you know
So like they cant say to Joel look
you know go away for a while or I mean she couldnt say to Judith no they cant come that week
uhhuh
you know and th and we were supposed to go out to dinner one night and they showed up unexpectedly
They were supposed to be out
They had gone to the Grand Canyon and didnt expect them back
uhhuh
And they showed up unexpectedly and you know they mom and Alexis couldnt could not bring themselves to say were taking Claire out to a nice dinner
uhhuh
see you later this is our only evening with her
yeah
you know we want to have some time with her
They couldnt bring themselves to say that but they were so upset that hed come back that they that the evening was just like a complete it was painful
Good
And we went to a different restaurant a cheap restaurant I mean it was it was just painful and I j I felt so pissed off because
you know there I was expecting a family vacation
I mean its not so much Joel I mean oh well anyway yeah
I mean it was supposed to be a family vacation
yeah
and it was like it was like so stressful I mean I dont know why I didnt know why I had bothered to go
yeah
And then you know Eve Eve and Seth were down in their house and moms all of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting Eve from too many distractions
uhhuh
because Eve had to work
yeah
So you know there was you couldnt go to Eves house or you couldnt you couldnt ask Eve to have Joel and Jemma for a night
uhhuh
although she was perfectly capable of having Guy and Jenny for a night
uhhuh
I was furious
And then Guy came and he was kindof a jerk you know
He was kind of harsh with me and
you know just sort of not very sensitive and didnt want to help with Joel and Jemma at all
We finally made him take them out for an afternoon
I mean it was all just in
you know just ridiculous
And it and it wasnt so great with Eve either
She she said she wanted to spend a day with me
uhhuh
so I set aside this so I w you know I set aside the day she told me
uhhuh
and it what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with her
uhhuh
and sitting there while she talked to her hairdresser for an hour and a half
and then going out to lunch with her and her babysitter
uhhuh
Who brought the baby to meet us
and I thought that the reason the babysitter was staying for lunch was because she would then take the baby away again
Right
But at the end of lunch Eve just told her to go home
uhhuh
So wed have this wed have this two hour lunch with the babysitter
uhhuh
and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops and that was the end of the day
And it was like
I mean it was almost if she was protecting herself from spending time with me
yeah
It was really weird
um and then they wanted to borrow the Baby Bjorn for their ha theyre taking Emma on a theyre on a camping trip right now with the baby
uhhuh
and I got kind of peeved and I decided I wasnt going to lend it to them
Well y I mean
I just didnt want to
Well anyway you use it righ
Well I I I havent used it on Long Island although I did think I was going to
Well but I mean what they were going to take it and then mail it back to you or
yeah yeah but I was like forget it Im going to lend this thing to
No thats insane
No they they they can go fucking spend some of their own money for a change
Unbelievable
yeah things are going things are g eh eh thank God really very very happy
Very nice
great
Whats whats whats with yo
uh lets see well Im han still hanging out at Westinghouse
yeah
I have your hat
I wear your hat all the time
oh goo I thought you you know its a good hat man
I I sent that to you with all good intents
I hope you appreciate it
I do
I wear it all the time
okay
I even have a p uh I I hope I have a picture
of myself when I had reserves the other day
you know th th the other month
uhhuh
I took a picture with me and I had hope it comes out
Ill send it to you
thankyou very much
um
If it doesnt Ill take another picture
Lets see
Go ahead
Well Im still working there you know and I got a Im on a pretty good project
Right
A long a long term next generation fighter plane
Reall
So thats kind of good experience I guess
uhhuh
And Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the C B S broadcasting network
I thought they bought them already
Well you know th its takes months to close a deal so theres lots of spec
ah
lots of speculation
Right
that theyll have to sell the
electronics division in order to do that
And wh wh and what would happen with yo
I guess wed be sold to another company and see what happens
I dont know
mhm
Im not too concerned about it though but
its a possibility
But
Have you have you y have a senior position there
Well I suppose so
But you know
They dont really think of it that way they look they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have
Its just a business
Right
they just
get rid of what they dont want
uhhuh
But thats thats still going pretty well
huh
nothing really new with the h
house or anything
weve had some interesting incidents with wasps
that have
been invading the neighborhood
They started they they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through
But I told you about that I think
I got a in the in the mail
yeah
So that
Well I wanted to ask you wha whats whats with the schoo
The schools are extremely expensive
Im going broke basically doing that
And I dont know how to handle that
But how come th how come how come they dont help yo
It doesnt make a difference
Theyre only going to youre still going to go broke whether they help you or not
Theyre not going to let you run a p run a run a profit
when youre on scholarship
If you if you have t two thousand dollars at the end of the year theyre not going to say oh well I guess you can have that
Theyre going to make you pay everything
Wait a minute Im talking about wait wait fir Im talking about yo your schooling
My schoolin
I thought you meant the kids school
My schoolin
yeah
I dont know
I put it on hold all the time
took a course last semester I I havent signed up yet for the fall
Its alotof stress
Its alotof stress
Taking to trying to you know you put out alotof money and you have to
work really hard to get it back
Right
And theres not necessarily any benefit to it either
So
hm
I was talking abou I was sorry I was talking about the kids school
Right the ki the kids
yeah R J told me how much
yeah
it costs
But meanwhile
its alotof money
she doesnt know how much you pay
I dont know why that is
I think what we pay
um mm we have to
books
for all the k all the kids
cost us
uh
for for for for two kids it cost about a six hundred sh about two hundred dollars apiece
uhhu
And then for
the taxes and everything else abo
maybe if it i c if i if it costs a year
um maybe
seven hundred dollars a a a kid
okay
Thats total everything
Pretty much
yeah
Pretty much
So were paying about eight times that
No about four about five times that
yeah
five times that
No actually ah were paying six times that
Im paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid
uh
Or more
Right
Right
But then you could also loo loo look into the other part
The the tax bracket
yeah
Here f here f
yeah forty five
forty five actually
with all the other taxes that are going on here
the first job
uh
i
i
I pay forty five percent
mhm
my salary
It goes to taxes
And then with my a all the mo all all of my second job
it already comes out to fifty five percent of that
mm mm mm
Plus the taxes
Unbelievable
thats incredible
Thats why I I got the I remember I got th the first paycheck
yeah I pretty much knew thats what the statistics were
Right
As soon as you you get yo
y you get you get the paycheck and
you see the
before tax
income and you say wow fi like f
finally youre able to get up to
a decent number
and then you look at th th the bottom and and you say what is this
You put it into your y your little pocket calculator
you say theyre taking f taking fifty five percent says fifty five percent
I say what country
in their right mind takes fif what about the encouragement eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more to earn more
They they dont care

The other day shes telling she she Rechas her uh Sarahs her doll so she says

I I sometimes feel like I you know I I want to keep it under control but to make sure that every eh d l you know down to the last is gone go back to tomorrow for what did I work so har
So this is supposed
You know to to keep it under control is one thing
all right so this is the she said the kids love it it smells nice
I hope so
oh good
okay worth a try thats for sure
An
Right she says after you shampoo their hair you just spritz through this mixture
Right
You put two drops into a whole cup of water
And you comb it
And just spritz it through their hair
oh

ah well try well try
okay Michalam are they still here Farrachs sister
I I met them
I just did I tell you
who
they wanted to come see Remopolin Mikhail and and ah Chanamalka
Farrachs sisters theyre here for the whole summer
oh right
So they wanted to see Remopolin thats like you know tourist attraction
uhhuh
So I met them in a park in and we had a a nice afternoon together
uhhuh
oh very nice
Very nice I havent see her kids in over a year
uhhuh
for sure I havent seen her Channa she has a Channa Sarah
yeah
I havent and I yeah she wanted to name her Sarah
but she thought it would be too confusing Sarah Sarah Chimalback so she named her Channa Sarah
yeah
uhhuh I see
So I she was born last Shavuos eh mm you know the year and some ago and I never saw her
uhhuh
So anyway
Your brothers are working hard in day cam
oh
oh yeah but then theyre also enjoying it
oh good
Thats what they said anyway
You could ask them
okay
um I wanted to ask you did they you know you have this LazySusan in your cabinet
yeah
Is that a common item do they still sell the
Its a Rubbermaid
yeah
yeah you want one or tw
probably Tupperware sells it also
who
I was thinking Tupperware probably also sells it no
I dont recall seeing it Tupperware but maybe
uhuh if they have like a two tiered one
yeah
because that would save alotof space and you know my cabinets are very high and things are always
I think the two that I have is a two tier that I took apart
oh really
yeah
because my the shelves are relat eh
oh your shelves are hig
not so high but theyre
yeah
theyre pretty high one from the other
yeah
And so so what happens is to maximize the space everythings on jumbled on top of everything else
uhhuh okay I can look
and then its behind and its very far its just i whatever
yeah all right
okay and so they also I wanted to ask you do you go to these secondhand stores some or you go only when you have a free
Sometimes
What
Brecha could use some Brecha could use some winter jumpers
Wint jump
She has polo shirts jumpers because she has polo shirts galore
I always look for jumpers but its not a common thing because most kids wear pants
Its not common
right uhhuh okay
All right but what size is she

Her mother told me about it

So whats the whole idea what are they trying to
Theyre studying l eh its for educational purposes
meaning do I sound educate

Too bad Im not going back to school
its too bad
Well you go every day
oh I got your message today
I wrote you back
I dont know if you checked it or not

yeah yeah you did oh about the prayers like yeah
yeah did you get that on
mhm
okay
edit so you didnt get my answe
oh no no I wrote you back
I answered you back because I I was like
oh he is at another time
because I I read your message oh great she says something totally opposite of what the other person said what am I going to do
So I just wrote this long drawn out thing on on the net and I was like
complaining about all the different versions of every rule that you ever hear
No I wrote about I got kind of personal with it because I always like start off you know and hed answer bah bah bah and then Id just end up like talking about myself and
like you know because I know people are wondering oh why does she want to know how you make lo up a prayer and you know
Well I mean it happens to everybody
and all that other stuff
yeah but some people are on this like kick that you know youre not supposed to ask stuff like that you know like what Dalia will post on the net
I bet some people are freaking out over that and I think thats perfectly natural to want to know you know stuff like tha
yeah I mean that was the purpose of this net
yeah but some people like I dont know if you were on last year when Jemilla
No I just started
yeah there was this big thing last year and I I took myself off because I didnt want to deal with it
This sister she wrote about this like cookie dough thing you know one of those like sexually perverted kind of jokey kind of postings things and so everyone was so offended and and like
you know alotof people arguing back and forth
They got really petty and
mhm
it happens alot you kno
It happens alot
Stuff gets you know g taken out of context and people get offended and stuff like that
yeah and plus because youve got y your dealing with so many different completely different kinds of people
I didnt really realize that though
I thought it was I eh this is a really diverse network
I didnt know there was so many people
yeah so people where getting mad at Delilas thoug
I mean just read in the post people are like you know
All right I mean not today
n no not today but bef
for
okay but before yeah
yeah
yeah you know Im supposed to meet her next wee
Really she lives in Michiga
No she lives in Chicago
oh
But Im going up to Chicago because theres this Sufi conference
oh
and Im going to stay with her until
oh thats great
I cant wait
yeah should be fun
Because I have not left my well I mean I was in Germany for one year and then I came back from Germany last fall
mhm
and then I have not been anywhere except for my house and school since then
oh
and like the road in between its like I got to get out
yeah thats good so how long is the conferenc
Its just for one day
oh
And its free
Thats the best thing about it
Its fre
yeah
Wow
yeah
You just have to find the means to get there righ
for some reason I
yeah I I am going to take the train I think
oh
mm So youre still going to go to the
yeah I want to actually a little I mean eh Robin already like paid for everything so I feel really bad if I dont go and I think hes kind of counting on me to go too so
yeah
Im just going to go
I all I have to do is find a way to get there which I havent found yet and its really
oh reall
yeah its coming up really soon
Because I thought you got
I dont think Ill take a plane there but I dont know a bus or a train or something
oh because I know that I mean if you got here you could probably ride with Robin
yeah I was thinking of that too but I dont even
But that will probably cost the same just to come here as
yeah
I brought like she said she was driving alone so I wouldnt mind like I even said to her you know Ill come there and then I can drive with you
yeah actually I kind of probably I mean is she driving there by hersel
yeah
yeah because because I dont I mean I think shes okay right now but it would be much better if she didnt have to drive by herself
yeah I think so too I I think thats you know I want to do that but I think she doesnt want me to go through all that trouble
yeah
but I told her its no big deal
I figure take the bus or the train there and then we can drive down together you know
yeah I mean I think that would be nice
I mean just cau and also because it is nice to go like if you are going to a big place not to go along because
yeah
because who knows how hard itll be to find somebody once youre there
right and Ill be alone I I wont know anything
yeah
And shes been here before like to the conference but I dont know if shes been to ohi o Ohio righ
yeah
yeah
Its in Columbu
yeah and also Im kind of worried about her because like you d I dont know if she talked to you about her health
yeah she has
yeah eh yeah
yeah because theres I mean like a like last a c few weeks ago she was like losing control of her hand and now shes on some kind of medication thats like put it back like she can use her hands again
mhm
But shes like she had to have her hand bandaged up and stuff and like she was having a real hard time at work
so that would me nervous like if she was going to drive by herself you know like what happens you know if something cooky goes wrong with her hand
and she cant drive but I guess shes at shes taking some medication now so I guess its okay but
hm
yeah I tried calling her tonight but I got her answering machine so I left her a message to her
hm
She calls me back Ill tell her thats what Ill do because I was thinking about that too but you know she like throws it off make it seems like its no big deal so and I think oh well but
well just tell her that youd prefer her company or something th then then it wont be like you know she doesnt want to put you out for you know inconvenience but
if you make it sound like you want to do it then shell probably agree
yeah
yeah
So y you still are not thinking of going righ
No I think not
yeah
yeah I mean because even before all that weird stuff you know Ive been talking about Ive always like had a kind of weird feeling about them anyway
I mean the whole organization just because I dont know it seems kind of strange like I dont know its hard to hard to explain but just real
Like someone me today and she said it would be like a you know she said you know we should really go to a conference you know as a group because Ill be living with like four or five sisters this fall who rented a place
yeah
and so she said you know it would be nice if we could go to a conference but it would have to be all females because she hears that some of them are meat markets so I mea I Ive heard other th
oh really
yeah
And I was like whoa I didnt you know I didnt even think of that but its kind of true
alotof eh
People looking for a
eligible women right
yeah
in one place but I dont know I dont know
mm
If I hate the experience then Ill never go to another one but if it turns out to be okay then I you know its okay
yeah
I mean I heard that its like real I mean that it that it is enjoyable you know people talk about you know religious things and get really into it and stuff
yeah
um I guess that w what I had heard bad about it was just that they were so into talking about like the Koran and stuff but they that they werent using this as being like a tool for social change at all like they werent talking about what we could possibly do
mm
As Muslims to like improve the world but rather just well just spend all your time praying kind of philosophy
oh
And so e
Nine thousand people and thats it hu
hu
I said nine thousand people and thats all they tau and thats all they find to do with that you know they have like uh a large group of people they could really make a difference but they I dont know I havent been to one so I d
yeah yeah I havent been to it either so I cant really talk
mm
But yeah I think that they just dont want to get really radical
Right
for whatever re I mean because I guess like Saudi Arabia funds it alot and
yeah th they were talking about the go Azum is that hi the persons name Azarahim Ive never heard of like this person
yeah Ive never heard of him either
and they said that hes like a crim hes a murderer and stuff like that
yeah
I dont know
And then theres the Mike Tyson thing that alotof us have
not too you know happy about that
yeah
And
Well it will be interesting to see what he has to say
yeah
Did you read my post like what I wrote about him and stuff like
That he was talking about his girlfriend or something
yeah hes talking about well I cant even kiss my girlfriend and I was like no you dont do that to your girlfriend what is that
So it was its like he doesnt really know I dont know
He I mean thats what he doesnt even have the basics down you know
like I think Im like we were at the beginning stage like I am
I I have the basics down and thats it but he doesnt even have that that like I I mean before I that there was no like girlfriend boyfriend thing and every
you know and other stuff
No pork any of that stuff but its like hes just you know
yeah I
out of it
He doesnt have control over his life
Thats what I think and so you know when people rag on him I I I tend to take the
like the side of you know like Mike Tyson because he really doesnt know
I mean he knew what he did but its it
not all him you know
Other people control him and tell him what to do and where to spend his money and stuff like that
yeah I mean I generally j hur just stay away from the T V anyway
yeah Im a T V magnet
So I never know about these things except for when people talk about it
Im a T V magnet
So I forgot what you did youre a grad student righ
No actually Im the eternal bachelors student
Youre a wha
A bachelors or undergrad or whatever you call i
oh really
yeah
What year are yo
Working on I think this is my fifth year
oh really
oh thats not bad
Ill
Ill be a fifth year
I mean I wont be one next year but its going to get to that point I cant finish my major in in three years
Im going to need three because my first two years I I cant tell you what I did with those
yeah
So its like Im in the same boat too
yeah what do you
But youve already graduated though righ
Wha
Youve already graduated righ
No see Im working on like three degrees at one time so its going to be another three years before I graduate
oh
Unless I just decide to give up and just take what Ive got
So what do you have so fa
or do you
Well right now if I I could graduate with a German degree right now
mhm
but German degree is useless
Right
Unless you get a P h D or something
mhm
So Im also working on an English degree because thats my real interest
You really English literature and not li literature righ
yeah well what I really really love is like medieval stuff
oh wow
and thats why I really think that like eng English and German goes together really well i if youre interested in medieval
mm
because in the past English and German used to be the same language like about the year before the year seven hundred
Wow
You know because like in Europe it was all like wandering pagan tribes and they just like they came you know they came down the Goths and all them
mhm
like they used to I mean they spoke Germanic language and some of them settled in Germany and some people kept on walking and kept on going to England and so the language gradually changed after that
Wow
oh this is perfect timing because my babys sleeping so thats great
oh good
all right
This is this was the last day I could do this so I had to get it in right now
Ive had this number for a month
oh
and kept thinking Im going to do it
Im going to do it
oh Im so glad you called
yeah its just about ten until twelve at midday
And your moms still there isnt sh
They just left on Monday
oh okay
and they went to New Zealand
Theyre in New Zealand right now and theyre there f for until Monday I think
okay
okay
Ive been leaving her messages on her machine
oh
because we moved to Casper
Youre in Casper
yeah we moved here I know thats very amazing
Im still amazed havent caught my breath yet
It all happened so very quickly
Why did p Barry get a job or somethin
He has a job
He got one after we came here
oh great
Well it isnt
I bet your mom is thrilled
yeah yeah it was a good time to move
We were gone long enough to know what it was like to live other places and
enjoyed other places and now it makes it more enjoyable to be back
yeah
And it was just right
Wed been praying for years what we were supposed to do
We always thought we were going to move to Denver and live in my grandmothers house that had died
uhhuh
But that didnt work out and about two months ago one morning I told Barry I said honey I said really think that were to move to Casper
and the next day I talked to my granny and she had moved up here last year
mhm
to be by mom and she said she had felt that for a whole year after praying that we were to move here too she just had never said anything to anybody
mhm
And so
she told me she had thought we should look for a house that had a big backyard and apartments that we could rent to pay the mortgage
that she just thought there would be one we could find like that so we started looking on vacation a couple of mon weeks ago
and we found one its a hundred and fifty thousand and I said granny I said we cant afford that she said well you know if thats what God wants hell provide it so we did all the paperwork and the bank turned us down
but then we did find the house
We found h another one for half the price for sixty six thousand had two apartments in the back that the lady had fixed up brand new
and a big backyard for the kids with a big cedar fence just like grandma had thought we should have we found it and we are getting the house
Thats great
yep she had prayed
Are you staying with your mom at the momen
yep were at moms
It all happened so fast we just knew it was meant to be
Wow
Like everything fell in place
Its like God was taking care of it and we were the actors
And Barry found a job right away
yeah somebody hired him over the phone long distance
It was really weird
So he finished school in Omah
yep
And hes doing like is it m massage and stuff is that what it
Right well and alotof physical therapy
Hes at the Shepherd At The Nursing Care Center
oh great
working with the older people
oh isnt that good
oh Alison that means we get to spend so much time together when I come home
I know
You know a lady called me two weeks theres a little old Christian Indian lady in Omaha that I know God provided in my life because shes been such an encouragement to me and Barry
oh
And her and her husband hes a l just a real dear you know And about two weeks before we moved here
she called me at home and she said shed been praying all morning for us and she said Alison she said I c I just felt real strong I needed to call and tell you that
that Gods taking you to your promised land and she said see she doesnt know my personal life you know we just share you know what I mean but she she doesnt know like me personally you know everything about us
but it was amazing the insight she had into she said into us she said you know she said it just God showed me that you guys were made the best out of Omaha and you were like the children of Israel and you didnt complain and kick and scream in the wilderness you know
yeah
And so because you were trusted God and made the best of it hes taking you to your promised land quicker than if youd complained the whole time and she just had this wonderful
oh it just gave me chills all over
I started crying
oh
And and she said so you know just trust Him because hes taking you to where he wants you to be because you were faithful you know in Omaha
and it was kind of like a wilderness
We did make the best of it you know
yeah
But her insight was so perceptive
I started crying
I was like oh thats wonderful And so then she says well we love you good bye
aw
And that is what it was like too you know
We made the best of it tried not to complain
You really have to yeah
and made the best of it and then this is like the promised land to us
It might not be to someone else you know
mhm
But for us it is
yeah
And then I was thinking just like you said if you come down here around Christmas time I wont have to worry about getting up here you know
I know it thats going to be great Im supposed to be there Im going to go to Denver first and then Ill come up to Casper on December fourth
I know
okay okay aw good
And then I will be there and Ill be there till after Christmas then
oh and the baby

Well let me speak to him about having them in a row I can fill him in on that
I know it because I tol he was teasing me and saying we dont need to use anything because its impossible to get pregnant when youre breast feeding and I just laughed at him I said no I said my friend Alison got pregnant when she was breast feeding
Im sorry
yeah
you know I wanted to wait a long time to have this next one but there i th itll work out itll itll be okay
yeah
because like Audrey wasnt intended but I wouldnt trade her for anything
yeah
aw isnt that good

And itll be okay because the little house we have has four bedrooms
Is she going to be two when shell be more than two when I come home no shell be
Shell be ei nineteen months and then when the babys born shell be like twenty two months so its not like just right after
just
yeah
I yeah its not like your first two hu
Nope
Whats the distance between Audrey and your little bo
Andrew
yeah Andrew
I dont know
Maybe fifteen months
The
Fifteen months
I know that Im going to have to figure that out once and for all because everybody asks
So you guys are bus
Are you working at al
yeah
Well you know what Alison this
A little bi
yeah this is just so wonderful the I would
Good
I took twelve months off work and then
Right
Ive w you know been thinking alot about how you know going back maybe in twelve months just two days a week or something but I really
Right
didnt know about that and the day before I left work I got a phone call from the university here that I used to work at
Right
And they needed somebody as what they call a tutor
oh
you have like a one hour session with the class and you just kind go over the lecture material with them
My
Right
and so and they needed somebody right away and it was actually starting kind of like the week I was supposed to have the baby so they gave me two weeks off and then Ive started doing that and its only one day a week
and its for like I have three classes and then they pay me to mark all their exams and stuff so Im going to make like in the fourteen weeks Im doing that Im going to make about
oh its nice
a l a little less than three thousand dollars so the Lords really looked after me that way that will practically pay for my trip home my you know like my ticket and stuff
Right
oh thats wonderful so glad
yeah its great
And I finish right before I come home so thats really good and its only like I only have to leave him at the babysitter for four hours
Thats fine a momma needs
A little bit of ti
a whole day off a week equivalent you know in hours Im sure convinced rather its to work a job she likes or
garden or do whatever
yeah
Gives you more time thats better with them when youre with them
yeah
Because I always taught those two mornings two to three ever since Ive had the babies and it was just enough time you know
its four year wait
And the kids love to go see where I was teaching and
aw thats
you know if Id been gone all the time I dont think they would have gone for that as much
No
But since it was such a short amount of time they loved to hear about what happened and
hm yep
aw thats good
so lot lots has transpired here and lots transpired at your house
Right well have lots to catch up on
yep yep Ill have to bring pictures we have
huh Im so tired
What time is it ther
Its about eight twenty
I get real tired in my pregnancies
So how far along are yo
I have no idea
Ill have to try to figure it out
Have you seen a doctor ye
No
Alison I had the best birth
aw Im so glad
I had thirty two hours of labor
but I had they have the most excellent program here
I got a community midwife
so I had a team of two midwives looked after me during the whole pregnancy and
aw
aw
I dont think you gave me an address though
I might not ha not have had one then
Right
I didnt get it right at first
So
So when did you get ther
I started work August first so whats today the nine twentieth or somethin
uhhuh
The twentieth yeah
yeah and I arrived in Detroit just the night before I started work so I had been here just three weeks
It will be three weeks Tuesday
That I started work and so I worked in the office for a week in a half and then we had our orientation for the new volunteers
uhhuh
And that was out in western Michigan on Lake Michigan about four hours from here
so we went up there and spent a week almost a week
sounds nice
Did you take your car did you drive ther
I drove up here yeah
From Omah
yup
Wow
It took a couple days
I mean it
it would have been maybe fourteen or fifteen hours
I didnt want to do it all in one day so I broke it up
and stopped in Wisconsin at a friends house
Right
So so anyway we have fifty six new volunteers that are oriented and off
They left for their new homes on Thursday and we came we came back to Detroit so
uhhuh
How many of you are ther
On staf
Right
Theres five of us on staff
The director
uhhuh
three area directors and then
I dont know what Kate Kate is the woman Im living with
Im not sure what her position is called its kind of like development
And helps the director with fundraising
Im Im not sure
what special
And the directors in Detroit
yeah were all in Detroit but the area directors um travel to the cities that the volunteers are in
and you know meet with the communities and stuff like that
So
Whats your area the
I go to Kansas City Saint Louis Des Moines and then I also have the community here in Detroit
oh thats cool
So yeah I me
Old stomping ground
I know
Its so cool
Do you have to go so many times during the year or
I go I go once in the fall for a week to each city and then once in the spring so well late winter I guess
So when I go in October I go first to Kansas City then to Saint Louis then I come back to Detroit and we have our
our fall retreat is in Dubuque Iowa so thats in the middle of my area visits and then
then I go to then I do my Detroit area visit then I go to Des Moines
but the way it works out for Kansas City and Saint Louis I go to Kansas City and at the end of the week its my birthday
mhm
So I spend the morning of my birthday with Elisa and then I fly to Saint Louis and spend
you know the afternoon with Chris or Lou or whoever I hook up with in Saint Louis so
mhm
Im like wow that worked out perfectly
Thats cool
yeah so
So it sounds like youre going to be gone alo
yeah from October sixth through Thanks through Thanksgiving Im here like I dont know ten days or something nutty like that and then
oh really
Are you going to go home for Thanksgivin
I dont know yet
Im going home
in September for just a a three day weekend or something like that um because September is pretty much the slo one of the slowest months on the job so
mhm
And I havent been to Texas in a while so I thought that would work out and then at Christmas time I think two of my cou well one of my cousins is getting married near Kansas City and Im hoping my family will just come up to Kansas for that
mm
mhm
And then Ill go there and see them so I dont know about Thanksgiving yet
Thats too far away to figure out so anyway I will be
Gosh are you happ
yeah I am I it was really hard to make the decision I actually at one point decided no Im not going to go I I just like I dont think I want to start all over again and
mhm
Im Im liking being in Omaha and all that sort of thing and so I called and and told the director you know I thought about it alot blah blah blah but I eh just dont think its right for me right now and
mhm
He was like I I dont know him very well but hed he had strep throat when I was here I mean he just wasnt feeling well I mean was like well
mhm
okay and
later that morning Kate called me at work
in in Omaha
And Im like Kate are calling to make this really hard on me an
eh
Shes like we just want you to think about one more thing and
eh the job is supposed to be a a two year commitment
uhhuh
But and that was kind of like one of the things that Im
thinking I dont know about doing a two year commitment eh you know
all this sort of thing
That is was too long or that it was too short
well
no I mean it could be longer so its not like it was too short
It was just
Right
you know I dont know
I dont know what I was thinking but anyway so theyre like what if it was just a one year commitment and
I said well Ill think about it
kind of threw me off and then
I I called later and I asked the director if um
I said well would you be willing to a first year um area director makes seventeen thousand and a second year area director makes eighteen thousand five hundred
First year you get three weeks vacation
Second year you get four weeks and I said well would you be willing to hire me as if I was coming in at a second year
mhm
um eh at eighteen five with four weeks of vacation and he said yeah he w he would be willing to do that
Wow thats alotof vacation
yeah it is which is wonderful
Thats great
mm
And thats more important to me than money so
Right yeah
So and we take we get the whole week from Chri Christmas to New Year thats one of our weeks of vacation so its only
mhm
you know in addition to that so
So anyway
And the rest you can take pretty much eh when you want I mean you work it around your schedule
Right
yeah you got to work it around your schedule which is
i in you know summer is not a really good time to take it because
youre ending one year and starting the next year and you know doing alot with the p the volunteers coming in
mhm
so Ill probably try to take most of it before next summer well see
mhm
um so I tho I thought about it that day and I ended up calling back and saying
okay Im coming to Detroit so
Its been really good since Ive I mean actually I made the decision and I thought ohgod what am I doing you know Im I just was
still unsure about it but within in a couple days I just felt really at peace with it
and remained so throughout the time that I prepared to leave and then ever since Ive been here I keep thinking
okay why am I so okay with this Im going to be falling apart any minute right you kno
Because Im really used to transition hitting me a little bit harder especially when I was so ambivalent about the decision but
Right
um
I dont know
Its been great
Thats great
So yeah
Great
Dont question i
Go with it
yeah exac thats what I said finally
I was telling somebody somebody is like well how you doin
I said well
I Im fine you know I keep wondering how long thats going to last
Im fine whats wrong with me
and then finally Im like you know
I am just going to be okay that Im okay
and if Im not okay later thats fine but right now Im okay I have to stop wondering when its going to end so
So thats kind of where Ive been
hm hm So tell me about NewYork I got your postcard
oh NewYork was r was really fun I I loved the city
It was
yeah
I I dont know I didnt expect to enjoy the city so much
You had been there before though hadnt you
n
Just really briefly
I went to Long Island
for a friends wedding and
Kate Katie and I my housemate from Oregon went together
uhhuh
and we we took a train into the city
a cab to the Metropolitan Museum Art
ran around there for an hour and half took a cab back and then the train back to Long Island so I mean that was it
Thats all we saw
oh that was it
um and I liked that but it just it didnt even feel like I had actually been in the city you know
mhm
So
so this was more like you know we we did alotof the
the touristy stuff and walked on the Brooklyn Bridge and
mhm
took the ferry and
um walked in Central Park and
went to a show and all that sort of stuff so it was really fun
Sounds great
and we also went out to to LongIsland where Joes mom lives
uhhuh
and spent time with the whole family
So
which was which was okay
It was good
At first when we had were planning the trip he had
hes like oh I hope we can go out and you know go to the beach and you can
meet my my brother and my nieces and nephe hes got four brothers three brothers two of them live on Long Island
You want to meet my brothers and my nieces and nephews and Im like
um I dont know Joe I dont I said I I think maybe we need the we need the time just to kind of figure out where our relationship is before
mhm
I said its not that I dont want to meet your family its just I dont know I I
Thats alot at once
I know his mom too and I think shes a little bit leery of this whole relationship based on what happened in the past you know
mhm
and I hurt her son and all that sort of thing
Im like
I just dont know if Im ready for that and so
but it it wor ended up happening that it was his brothers birthday and we were out there to go to the beach and
so Im like okay we can you know I can handle this and
it was very nice actually so
Good
that was fine
and
So where did things end u
oh I dont know Vick
it was really fun and
I mean in some ways Joe is somebody Ive known a long time and
and know pretty well
but in other ways its like this is a whole new relationship
mhm
so its its kind of weird to walk that balance like well
you know one minute were talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together
and the next youknow Im like
Wow
wait a minute I cant believe were talking about this I mean
Whats he doing no
Hes in his last year of graduate school at Columbia University
Hes getting his Masters in Public Administration
uhhuh
And hes been working with this man whos starting a no a new nonprofit organization
he worked with him last summer and this summer and probably will work with during the school year
Beyond that
I dont he doesnt know what hes going to do you know but its
you know its kind of hard because
Kind of open but
He might want
I mean chances are really good that hell want to stay in New York or at least on the east coast you kno
Right
Kind of interested in politics so D C would be an option and
I dont know
Its just hard because
thats not really
yeah
where Im at but I mean were both sort of like we dont know where life is taking us
and
Hard to start a relationship when that
yeah so what do we do
you know do we make decisions based on each other I mean this was just the second weekend we saw weve seen each other so
hes coming here over Labor Day weekend
mhm
and then
because my schedule gets so crazy
starting in the middle middle of October I am going to
go go there the first weekend of October
That was kind of hard for us to decide
you know he hasnt even been here yet
I havent seen him since the Fourth of July weekend and
and we decided well you know lets go ahead
Now whats the size of it compared to the other place because now I remember that
The size of the classrooms
yeah
um maybe two thirds as big
mhm mhm
But see I have fewer children too
oh thats good how many
About twenty or twenty two
oh thats good
mhm smallest class in the school
mm
They range I think from my twenty to up about thirty two
And what grade is it agai
Third
okay
They dont like to pass thirty but I think the seventh grade has thirty two
uhhuh
And they might not all show up either
You know you never can tell with people like that
Right
Right
So we shall see
oh
Well Im glad you have a smaller number now
oh and its all one grade
all one grade its
Tammy you almost wont know what to do with yourself
oh I think Ill find many a thing to do somehow
oh oh gosh so have you seen any other teacher
oh yes see when the principal was away two of the men the second grade teacher John McCall whos a lovely gentleman and the computer teacher Mr Deverow covered the office for the principal
hm hm
I see
So John McCall was doing it last week and Mr Deverow was doing it the week before that
uhhuh
So they were very helpful
Now will your class have much opportunity to use the computer
oh yes once a week they go up
uhhuh
For forty five minutes
I have three computers in my classroom
Do yo
Yes every classroom has two or three
mhm
oh
mhm
hey thats good
yeah its great
eh theyre real old you know the ones in the room theyre like
uhhuh
the old Commodores I think
mm
but theyre I B M compatible
Thats good and so like what program is in it what will you use it fo
mhm
Well I think what hes done see Mr Deverow makes these discs
uhhuh
to go with your work
oh
So if you want s something on you know addition of facts up to nine hell have a disc that you can use to reinforce that those skills
Really
Yes hes done that
hey thats great
He spends his hes been there twenty five years they say
Really
yeah so he has spent many many hours just making discs for the teachers
Thats fantastic
mhm and we have an art teacher a music teacher and a gym teacher
Wow
And a fulltime librarian plus an assistant librarian whos a Sister
My goodness
A Benedictine Sister so you do get three forty minute periods well about three half hour periods by the time you take them and bring them back a week
Yes right right
mm
but I think you also have to stay with the children all during lunch and recess
oh so thats a tradeoff
I think you need that forty minutes
So when do you get your lunch you eat with the
Well I think you eat with them as far as I know
What do they eat in their room is that i
In the classroom yes as far as I know
aw gee aw gee
And I hate that
I hate to have food in the room
I do too yeah
Because it makes animals but however
oh dear
well speaking of animals remember the fleas we had at Immaculate Conception last year that I was telling you abou
Yes yeah
Theyre back again
At Immaculate Conception oh
At Immaculate Conception Carol Anne said she was eaten alive the other day
no oh
And was over there helping her with something on the computer
yeah
came home she was she had welts all over her whole legs
uhoh
I said where were you toda
She said Immaculate Conception I said theyre fleas
oh
No she said no
yes they are
oh
So Carol Anne had to get the exterminator to put the bombs in the rooms again
oh my goodness
They closed everything up on Friday and they bombed out the whole place for the weekend
oh
But how did they come back I guess all the eggs stay in the rug is that i
Well I dont know I guess they do but thats a long time incubating I mean you didnt have them through the entire year and then
yeah no we didnt have them again unless they come in the windows in the summer
mm
See that could be it
yeah maybe theres some way
And they infest the rugs
Because there are no animals around there righ
Animal
No no no dogs or cats or raccoons right yeah well there could be rats
mm
Rats or anything like that
Ive never seen any
oh
Mice Im sure there are but
yeah
oh gee well thank God you discovered them now before school started could you imagine
right right
Well they were in the building when we started school last year
oh
The little kindergarteners were all bitten when they sat down on the floor
ah oh
Because they were covered with bandaids on their legs
aw
And one mother wrote a note
dear Mrs Henry my child is bitten by something on her legs you must have fleas in the school
oh
But th theyre the most awful bites Ive ever had
Yes I had a I was in a patients home once and they had fl oh they are awful I I thought
mhm and the marks stay with you
I thought I really can commiserate with animals now little dogs when I see them scratching oh its a terrible thing
mhm yes oh yes oh yeah mhm
oh
And they bleed and form this terrible scab
yeah
eh
oh
Well tell me about your life no
oh I had a wonderful time down in Baltimore
mhm
Really good symposium I love the workshops and then in the evenings my mom and I linked up together and we did something different each night
oh nice
yeah the first night we went over to the Inner Harbor and then the second night they had scheduled a cruise you know on the Spirit of Baltimore you know
oh yes
And fortunately that hurricane didnt affect us it was supposed to hit that night you know and have very choppy waters and everything but it didnt it was a beautiful evening
mhm mhm uhhuh
and that wa was about a three hour cruise
oh nice
Yes
It wa we were on the ship over three hours and actually moving about three I guess and then the third night we went over to Little Italy and had a very nice Italian dinner
oh
yeah it was fun
oh good
really was and the the Little Italy looks very much like south Philadelphia actually
ah
And the restaurants are in the row houses the row houses are just kind of broken through on the insides you know and
ah mhm uhhuh
yeah so it was fun really was yeah and my mom got alotof rest while I was
oh that sounds nice
oh good mhm
At the workshops all day she was just resting enjoying herself and
Right yeah mhm
Thats nice she could go with you mhm
yeah Im glad she could because just it happened to work out because she had three days left of vacation and it was three days so
Right yes mhm and then you had a good time at the beach I know at Stone Harbor
oh yeah that was nice and relaxing that was great too it really was so the thing with this the hotel happened to be about a block away from Camden Yards which is the stadium
Yes mhm
Well we arrived just as the traffic was going in for the game well I didnt know there was a game I mean I didnt even know where I was going you know I was just following the directions well the traffic I was beside myself I said oh my goodness
oh no oh mhm mhm
and here when we you know as we approached the stadium we saw thats where people were headed and we said oh there must be a game and sure enough there was so for the first three days the Orioles had a home game
ah
So the traffic was unbe but I didnt drive once you know I got there but we were just walking around and theyre such avid fans its unbelievable I mean everything was the Orioles you know and of course I know nothing about the Orioles other that theyre a team you know
mhm
And it seems one of their players is about to break Lou Gehrigs record or something
oh yes it was on the T V mhm
oh listen to you you know all this stuff see I didnt youknow but in fact the one of the fellows is talking about this player whom I never heard of you know and how proud they are of him and everybody he says oh this whole towns going to go crazy when he breaks that record
mhm well Ive seen it on the T V yeah
oh boy mm
all this you know so oh well So the good old Phillies were not quite that avid fans
No theyve gone down to the bottom again havent they or pretty close
oh they probably well they won today
Or did the
Yes Pat was listening to the game
They won today in the tenth inning
oh
And they won another game this week so thats good you know theyre coming up a little bit you know but
Well maybe theyll get back up there mhm
they really get into these slumps I mean its unbelievable
Yes mhm yeah mhm
Once a you almost hate to see them lose a game because its as though here goes l about twelve or thirteen theyre going to lose you know its like they dont just lose one or two and then win its just they get into a real slump
mhm
Well but anyway and so t and now its just Pat and I home this evening
oh thats all Marys away
Shes on retreat
mhm
She gets back Tuesday I think
uhhuh
And
question how did you see Annette toda
I did yeah Pat and I went over eh we went over this morning about eleven
Hows she doin
mhm
Well she looked well eh shes on complete bed rest because she has the phlebitis
hm
uhhuh
Definitely and they had to give her the Heprin and of course that affects her platelets and
oh
And you know she said he was going to give her the chemotherapy this Thursday
oh wow
So I dont know she said Im just disgusted and
mhm
You know I could appreciate this but Im thinking why doesnt he hold off another week
aw
aye
you know I mean you know each one is counteracting the other it
Yes oh
Its a hard I I mean I know its not an easy decision for him to make
yeah hm
Nor for her either but Im thinking ohmygosh you kno
But she seemed in good spirit
hm
um had a couple books there
mhm
had the T V on when we got there and she said Im really dozing through this you know it was one of the new shows
hm yes
But and then Ray Catherine I saw yesterday
ah hm
and
shes going to live at New Sherry now is that it yeah
Yes she told me that
She told me that
mhm
So
The day that she that I was leaving
was the day that she moved in there you know
that morning yet well
oh really oh
that morning
Thank God Irene I had cleaned the room before
oh
oh my goodness
because after that
You mean the day that Marcia picked you u
That da
oh
Yes thats right
I knew Marcia would be there like after lunch or so
uhhuh
And I said Im not going to have to spend this whole morning cleaning this room
yeah
Plus doing all my laundry and the wash and packing up
Right
So I said let me do all the r the big cleaning the day before
uhhuh
At least Lorraine said my Lord youve got the room
better than you had ever seen it in your life
oh
Not knowing this was going to happen
ohmygosh
Now after mass Friday morning Dorothy says to me how packed are yo
I said well I said Im in pretty good shape
I have to make the bed you know and take the towels out
yeah
and put the rest of my clothes in the bag
Well she says
See if you can do it in a hurry because Marie Catherines moving into that room
ohmygosh
I thought wasnt it good that I had done all the cleanin
oh yeah
I looked at the room
Left to vacuum the rug
Thats all I left to the last thing
oh
And my suitcase to all close up
The only thing that bothers me was I had to get out and then go into like a hallway
and I froze
One bag full of halves
to make Aunt Annies peach cake
mhm
in the Winter
so well see what happens
I made a wonderful peach thing last week
um you know the recipe book that Jane gave me
yeah
at Christmas time from
deserts from your bread maker
yeah
well you make the dough and you leave it in the bread maker until it goes through a couple of cycles of
ye kneading and raising and all that kind of stuff and then you take it out
before it bakes
mhm
and you divide it into two and let it sit for a few minutes
and then press into like a round
pizza pan
oh
and then I put now the kids had picked berries along the road
um
uh raspberries blackberries and huckleberries
So I made one with that on it
and the other one I sliced peaches real thin and then you put cinnamon sugar and and melted butter
on the top and bake it and of course its a real
you know its a yeast dough
mhm
uh its a real good dough
yeah and good
and boy they were and it it tells you
the recipe actually calls for some kindof a
on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or sour cream
something like that
so we just used Cool Whip and it was
it was very good it was very nice I took one I coo
uhhuh
to the guy across the road who cut the grass for us while we were away
uhhuh
and I I
and he enjoy it
I have no idea
um as a matter of fact I keep meaning to ask him and weve been
weve talked on several occasions they kind of paved our road this week
oh
um
what do you mean kind of
well
have the new people have been after him about
the potholes and the dust and everything else you know
mhm
and she goes down there on a regular
basis and and raises a fuss
mhm
and they finally said well then theyd be out
and they they
oh I dont know it was
they it it just keeps get getting pushed back and back well finally they came out I think out Monday
uh well no actually when we came home we noticed that theyd shaved some some of the
uh swale off across the road
now they still have not fixed that pipe which is my big complaint the whole time
mhm
Its still hanging up in the air and Everhart is beside himself because
we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wouldnt get their tires cut on it you know
mhm
well they never ha they didnt do that but
um what they did wa well now let me see first Monday
they turned off the water here all all morning on Monday
because the pipe had sprung a leak
uhhuh
so they had to fix that before they could do the road then they came down Tuesday and they did all this preparation work
they dug
they put a pipe sort of
caddywampus under under the road just below
our driveway and before the new peoples driveway
but the way they put it in mother
and left it
it blocked our pipe so that anything that wouldve gone
through our pipe wouldve backed up immediately
and and flooded our property
What kind of engineers do they have working down there
oh Everhart said he doesnt think they have any idea at all you know
well I went up to help
the band
people help fit band uniforms
yeah
Now you know that in my day we got our uniforms fit but there werent parents you know
this is all done by the parents
oh
um so I went up to help
and I got there at eight oclock and around eleven I called home and Everhart was beside himself
uh you know as soon as the kids told him it was me he told them to tell her
wha that theyd made a colossal mess out of the road
and so I said to Ive got to go Ive got to go see whats wrong
well the i they dug this deep trench and
put these huge rocks
in the road
Now when I back out I have to be careful
that I dont go into the ditch across the road where these great big huge rocks are
mm
um you know I I cant I just cant even begin to tell you well
at any rate they got all that done
and then they came along and
what theyre buying now is stuff
called well its crushed asphalt its recycled road basically
yeah
and
they told us that
its it
holds up better than the stone that theyd been putting on
and it also
well it its so delightful to come down the road and not be followed by a cloud of dust you know
yeah
but they put it all on and smoothed it they they came down with uh great big heavy rollers and
all that kind of stuff and
um it it actually looks like road out there
so
uh Im pleased about that you know the way they did the other stuff
well thats g
and I said to him I said to Everhart
its not m they did come back and dig out
our ditch
mhm
and fill our ditch with stones too great big stones
eh
and I said Everhart
just dont get upset about because
if the lot next to us ever gets built on
theyre going to have to come back and do it again
yeah
because theres no place
i i theres
the pipe that they put in will pour water right into this pe persons front yard
hm
um you know and and I said I I cant help it that they do things in such a
dumb way thats you know its its very annoying its very frustrating especially when youre paying for the privilege of having them make a mess
yeah yeah
you know
so there was a terrible accident down here last night terrible
um up
where
eh yeah
you know on the highway when you come down and route two and four join up there
yeah
um
apparently a t tour bus was coming down from Annapolis
never stopped
there and hit a a car travelling north head on
and Andrews coach said today that they brought two dead
to the hospital and at least seventeen from the tour bus in serious condition
ohgod
must have been a terrible terrible thing you know
oh yeah
why listen if we come up
yeah

uhhuh
So

one of the places that we stayed in and I think it might have been the the one
in New Jersey
um where theres a special rate at at Qualities or Comforts you know what I mean
yeah
and I said to Everhart I may just give them a call and see what it is you know and that way
mhm

Im trying to get all this stuff wrapped up
I got a call
you know I told you that there was a job that I was interested in within the school district
yeah
but you didnt get it
and I I didnt even get a chance at it because they they
did something crazy you know well
um my friend called me the other day and said hey
across my desk came that announcement again its open
and I said youve got to be kidding me I was told that it was all but
wrapped up well
here what they did they changed it
in an attempt I gue I dont know why but it was supposed to be a directors position
so and we went to Niagara Falls and we went on the Maid Mist you know the boat that goes like under the falls
no
you dont alright well theres a boat that goes
you go out on this boat and they give you these plastic raincoats which are dangerous but and then I
speak up I can only hear about one out of every other word that youre saying
okay
you go in a boat
yeah
and they give you these little raincoats
and then they take you right into all the mist from the falls and at one point youre like ten feet from one of the
Niagara Falls
wow
do you get we
yeah its I dont know it seems like its raining for a little bit but
no youre not you dont go under the falls
uh you think hed be killed if he went under the falls
it depends who you were
I dont know it depends how you were built
okay
well
I dont know
so thats pretty neat
mhm
oh okay so went to Niagara Falls and
I
mhm and then we went home
okay
oh what did you do
weve went to the pond
and then the next day we went to the pond and then the day after that we went to the beach and
so you know just switched off between the pond and the beach doesnt mean anything we did we just went swimming all the time
oh
youre still doing tha
mm yeah
how long are you there for
were leaving
well were leaving for Baltimore in two days
oh so youll be home for Shabbat
yeah
oh
I didnt know that okay
okay
now you do
hm
now you do
okay
oh guess what
what
I start school on next Thursday
what
because the high schools start earlier
so I have to start Thursday
Thursday
Thursday
not this week next week but still
oh next week
yeah
oh thats not so bad
no but
whats today so now its so today its the twenty first
yeah
hold on
oh
so what
yeah
yeah
mhm
you there
yeah
okay
its the twenty first I start on the thirty first
mhm
hm I start September fifth
yeah so does middle school but
mhm
oh well
oh well
too bad
and we went on a Sunfish and it was really neat
eh eh and the wind was in the sail and
what is the difference between a Sunfish and a sail what is a Sunfish
its a little sailboat
really scrawny one
oh
how many people fit
about one and a half
one person can sit comfortably the other person can be
scrunched up and then if you want you can stuff a third person in
oh
which we did
ooh
and she sits like on the wrong side
with the boat leans over they just fall out
and well it has
and
big boats you know they usually have two sails or more
yeah
well a Sunfish is
its really small and it has one sail
and its really light
um I mean the sail was big
in proportion to the little tiny rest of the boat
yeah
so it goes really fast its like
and that
and you know it can only carry two or three people as I told you
and its its fun
so which do you like better
um
I guess the Sunfish
okay
I bet
anything else
oh yeah we did go out on the big boat once also
ooh boy
last time I came up
0
are you doing anything exciting in the next few days
yep
what
were leaving
besides that
were leaving tomorrow
I mean were leaving for Framingham tomorrow
where my cousins live and then were staying there for the day and then were leaving the next day
okay
like that so nothing much exciting
except for going out on the Sunfish today again
oh
just
um
yeah
you s you sleep in the shed
no I dont
okay
but when my cousins just came up

and today we went to the aquarium
is it big eh
and wood salt no actually its its tiny
oh
and its free
so you can
and its its kind of neat I mean you can go in and just
pick up all the things in there
one floor is devoted to
lobsters and crabs and
hermit crabs and starfish that you can pick up
and stuff you can touch
right
yeah until like you find something that
that isnt stressful or and not boring
yeah
thats the main two combinations righ
yeah
Not stressful and not boring
yeah
Well its like I have no problems with secretarial work okay thats what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know eh
mm
y you dont get bored because you are always doing something different
and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two ifs there
mhm
but you get no respect I mean oh youre a secretary and the pay is pretty pretty crummy
about the well its pretty much the same as as what Im getting you know but
um depending upon where you work and all but you know its like thats no answer either so
Ive just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed
But anyway
a and you can think about that pregnancy thing
oh yeah that pregnancy thing yeah that do the
Maybe thats your theres your hormones calling
yeah well no the funny thing is its like
ten years ago I wouldve said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby
you know but like at this point in time its kind of like were going to do it because if we dont do it
uh
eh you know in the next year or two wed regret it
you know we we figure its something wed want to do its not like were doing it because we have to do it or theres peer pressure or well a little
mm
little peer pressure
oh no no no
I yea I know exactly where youre at because I think about that too I got about like six or seven years
I figure my body is a very slow
yeah
maturer you know what I mean like I didnt get my period until I was sixteen I dont look
yeah mm
e I mean I look like about uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am
and Im just starting to get my period actually now
yeah yeah
as an adult So I kind of figure well I must I Im probably Im probably good until at least some time in the early forties and I
could probably go a little longer than that I know theres a risk and all that bullshit
yeah
but yeah I think about that too because its like I mean I I kind of like the way things are going in the in the total lack of responsibility
I know well I mean thats the thing kids are cute and all that and I was just we we
mm
slept until noon we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats
fell back to sleep okay I mean were talking total slackers
mm
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid w we couldnt do this you know and
mm
No you got to be focused on that and I wa I mean theres alots of other things that
I mean as far as like living situation I I was feeling kind of settled you know like
Right
Im not going to be like
traipsing around but
I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe
y yeah
ten years alright ev even if I could project that far which I really cant
yeah
but I mean you got a kid you cant do fucking ten years w
I know
its like cool I think Ill go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country
I know well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate so well know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully
mm
you know and then then theres four or five years doing the damn work and
mm
Hes crazy he wants it thats fine he can do it no problem but that sort of ties us up here
although we like the place were in no hurry to leave it
yeah
and that would be good
But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be
pretty darn good because
mm
you know were a after after coming back from Spain from those two and half years
it wasnt so much an adjustment to the way things were its just
asking the question gee do we really like
um the way things are over here with
the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing I mean Im really in the nine to five thing more so than he is
he you know he should be there by oh
oh well lets say eight thirty to nine
but yeah
he doesnt care when
well okay and his professor is
obviously uh a great person to work for so Im Im envious but um
whatever Im you know Im caught up
mm
in it and and I dont like it you know
too many days Im Im working and and eating at my desk at about twelve oclock and Im thinking
mm
This is crazy you know in Spain we had this
break and you sat you talked to people you know you enjoyed your food you relaxed
mm
you know
and its a fairly productive nation right you know Whats going on here xx
yeah you have to yeah
I mean you have to like look at like both ad I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages
in what oth ever place youre in
mhm
and think about the disadvantages of the place that youre not in
yeah
Otherwise you go nuts righ
Thats true yeah
yeah
I know Laura tried to because we have email and and so she sent me a letter back saying
you know remember how crowded the transportation is and what else
mm
how expensive everything is
and I you know I remember those things of course you know
And you work you know possibilities were alot more limited
True
and the language you know
yeah
constantly like kind of like I mean those could be p considered positive things as well
yeah
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie rather than
mhm sure
They just like worrying over them
Well you know
and thats why Im I I
it helps to have
kindof a glimpse into the future righ
And thats how thats how we got to
mm
Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers and it turned out that way because
mm
we had this idea of and I I really feel that thats important and
so what Im having an idea of now is
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate it takes about five or six years
we have the kid probably
we he gets a research position
somewhere in France or in Spain
and then we move over there and you know
I take care of the kid and and
do some you know little day labor whatever you know well see
mm
um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years and then we take it from there
yeah because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is is all so subject to
whatever change in the weather that happens to be righ
mhm
oh I know I know
And and its like
you know what I think because I get like the same I get the same as you like some days its just kind of like
you know what the hell am I doing not not with my life but ge but I mean just what
yeah
you know like what like where do I get the animal to to just you know
to do anything you know I just lay in bed and dream for for the whole day easily
yeah
I know
Well
I I know I know what youre saying I I feel theres sort of a
a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because
for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house
mm
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said
is this what we really want to be worrying about right now and you know I realize no
yeah absolutely
and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future or I I know I have this tendency to do that
And miss the present completely I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan
yeah
yeah yeah
you know and e each little I mean iits like as far as Im concerned
theres like no pleasure thats as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about
the past but like when youre there in that moment
its I mean everything else just kind of like its almost like time doesnt exist
yeah
You know yeah
Well
I I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is
okay I get the late I get to work a little bit late which is common and they dont really care since Im an hourly you know you have to be within a certain time frame
mm
and so everyone else is parked
Im way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
and I you know I close the door I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day
and I hear the birds singing
yeah
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds and thats that it sort of cheers me up it I you know I realize what a minute okay
in that nasty sterile office where the windows dont even open
eh I will be for the next eight hours or so but out here there still is some life going on and just sort of cheers me up to know that
okay I can come back to it you know So thats thats
yeah in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all
There you are you and the birds you know
yeah
yeah yup hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know
oh yeah
And every once in a while when you know I can I can remember
just being back with people or or eating some place you know in Barcelona and
so it brings me back but
I still havent gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
um
Im like dying to go there
You mean the one right next to the apartment
yeah yeah yeah
Well its not French its just its just gourmet its gourmet Catalan
oh its not oh I thought it was Fre ah really
yeah yeah
Well even better
Save it for save it for a special occasion you know and and you know you might need a reservation too yeah
yeah
I will
I should have some some visitors and my familys planning on coming this summer so Ill take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also
yeah yeah
Is the one over in Gracia that its kind of on a corner I think I think I
uh
no theres a couple places in Gracia that Ive been going to
uhhuh
But theres one in the BarioGottigo actually its on the other side of Leotana
huh
Like down over by the Bornillo
okay
And its got Ive only been there Ive only eaten there once alright but Ive been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place
uhhuh
Actually you know I know where Im going to go I have a friend my friend from England I dont remember if I I told you about her shes my my old roommate
mhm
From Oviato and shes coming she got a job down here shes coming on Friday to live
mhm
And ah I this is like the perfect because when we lived in Ovia Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time that would be the f perfect place to take her when she gets her
yeah
yeah
We well Im glad to hear that you got a job that you like and and uh think that you wer you were able to stay that was I was a little bit worried a at first
you know that when you got back there because the th the money would run out probably in April or so and you know
yeah
And I knew you know I knew Id get a job right I I mean I knew I would get a job but
a and I after I just stopped thinking about it I just started th thought well fuck it I am going its like inevitable and Im Im going to get some I want something I have to get something and I will
uhhuh
um huh
But I didnt say I I just thought that you know Ill get a job and at this point if I get desperate Ill just have to take anything
yeah
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something thats
Fairly sweet I mean eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice but Im changing my attitude to the point where
Im not going to get stressed out about it too much
Im not going to try to change anything
Good
Im going to go in there Im going to do a nice job Im going to have a good time
uhhuh
you know i and Im not going to I mean its not the same Im either like from working with kids I mean that was like you know my my career for like eight years
mhm
But this is you know more like
its nice its really nice
And you could
Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the
States or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some some place in Spain too with with l ah
yeah
yeah I dont have a big draw for it right now if anything like I would like to open a bi Ive always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant I mean it takes tons of money
yeah
yeah me too well well
But like Id love to
Thats why I want to win win the lottery first though because its like you ha
Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up but
well yeah well good and and so youre youre probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool Emory was telling me that so
yeah and I probably wont
yeah so
and now Im Im still trying to find somebody to
to to finishing teaching me
rolling I I I started to learn rolls last year and then
we ran out of weather before I could really get it
and this year I have
well rolling in a sea kayak
I dont even know anybody around here that rolls in sea kayak
oh yeah everybody I know rolls in sea kayaks
really
well no I shouldnt say that but
yeah I mean sea kayaking rolling in a sea kayak makes a lot of sense because
its a hell of a lot more convenient to be able to roll your kayak back up again
oh yeah
than it is
to to have to get out and reenter
than get out and then get back in in the cold water
yeah
yeah so thats why I want to be able to do it I mean its just
its its sort of knack you know you learn it in a couple of hours and then you got it
uhhuh
but its it you know you got to get the the expertise and you got to do the practicing and stuff and
yeah
so far I havent had anybody to teach me but Im still working on it
but what Ive done twice this summer is go
inflatable river kayaking
thats something else
in an inflatable raft
yeah
its its a one person inflatable kayak
thats wild
and its just like a little mini raft thats shaped like a kayak
yeah
and theres no cockpit
yeah
its all open
yeah
and its self bailing
yeah right
so you can take it on class three waves
how does it self bail
well it
well
its so shallow
the floor is not the floor is not attached to the sides
theyre both inflated separately
oh
theyre tied together
but what happens is because the floor is inflated
the whole thing rises up with you in it
and as it rises back up
the water seeks its own level so it goes out
yeah it bails out
yeah
yeah
but dont you have to be able to roll that
so its just like a big
no people dont roll it
no
if you fall if you fall out
you just swim up to it and you clamp her back in
but if youre in white water and stuff youre going to be out of it more than youre going to be in it
well not in a class three
no
we dont do anything thats class four
oh okay
and
I think its incredible what you do
its really fun I mean its just going through big waves and having to maneuver around rocks and and stuff
yes
we went through one
one rapid that was maybe class three plus
half the people made it and half didnt I made it one day and then the next day I didnt make it
and its just a big wave you get washed out of the boat
mhm
mhm
but we had its really been fun
well
is and what is this called again
this is called this is river kayaking with an inflatable kayak
right
I see
its just like a raft
wow
just to let you know that hard hypolon
yeah
rafts
like zodiacs
that the big rafts yeah
yeah
and
you know it has it has an inflated seat in it you just and you have a regular kayak oar paddle
and its its just really a blast because everybody can do it
mhm
you dont have to have any river kayaking skill
uhhuh
mhm
you know because river kayaks are tippy
oh yeah they were really
oh
and you know and youre locked into a cockpit and theres you know what you got to know what youre doing
yes yes
yeah
with this beginners have a blast
uhhuh
so we just have you know
about two weeks ago I met about ten friends
at this campground
up on the Trinity river not that far from forest Glenn where I used to live
this is the middle fork of the Trinity and I used to live on the south fork
and we camped at the campground and the next day we did our own shuttle we went up
and we we probably
it was probably about three four hours down the river back to the campground
and it was just we took a lunch and it was just gorgeous
you know and
mhm
yeah it was it was a blast
so we you know Ive been doing that a little bit and thats thats fun
mhm
but I want to get more into sea kayaking too
I havent
what yeah you got a good place down there sea kayaking is good good
yeah theres a lot of places to go I just havent been going
yeah
hows your love life
interesting
good
Im not going Im not going out with the lawyer anymore

so its fun I mean you know I have a active social life I just havent met the one perfect woman yet
yeah
aw the one perfect woman
oh yeah
the one that really clicks
I hope
I hope we keep dropping our expectations of perfection
yeah well that might help
yes
thats true
and Im well aware that it might help
well I think it it doesnt need perfection it just needs to click
exactly yeah exactly
I cant believe it
I know its so soon yeah
thats so exciting and you and when do you take off from work

I know but not only that when I speak french
which I hardly ever do but occasionally I do
when I speak french I have a french Canadian accent as opposed
to it
god
a normal french accent which is
kind of weird like this person from the states having a french Canadian accent
youre its not popular to be french now anyway so
oh well the french Canadian is
completely different than
oh completely different is
french oh yeah its not even
yes things are very upsetting over here right now
yeah I know norm sent

no things have been have not been happy about any of that at all
yeah
so time will tell well see what happens
uhhuh
but yeah otherwise things are going really well did you see Tyson my goodness
hes sitting here in his caca right now with his little
stuffed animal and hes waiting to be pushed around
thats one of the things youre going to have to do is just heaps of exercise
is he
when theyre a little bit older
has he ever made any words yet
is he saying any words yet
oh actually I was just in the middle if a sneeze at the same time as an oh wait
that was a big one
actually hes saying a lot of words hes not he isnt saying any sentences yet
uhhuh
but he might
is he saying like two
two words
yes so
yeah theyre sort of saying
bye bye ma ma or
choo choo train

no that thats always a recent one choo choo he usually just says choo choo for train and now he just started saying choo choo train
uhhuh
and
hes so funny he has this stuffed animal that my mother had given him its this little
soft cuddly
almost like a windbreaker sort of material
mhm
and he calls it Tyson
and everywhere he goes now he has to have this Tyson with him
oh you have it when your mom comes to visit shell be so thrilled
oh I know I know
yeah
listen I think its great its really its so cute
yeah
and he just loves it he has to sleep with it and he its just its the first time hes really attached a lot of attachment
a lot of
its well I guess attachment to something
uhhuh
and what else is he doing
oh I took him to it was so funny
I took him to a birthday party yesterday it was his first birthday party I was looking forward to it all week actually for two weeks now Ive been looking forward to it Sophia aw his first
birthday party that hes been invited to
so excited next door neighbor right bring Tyson over screamed
wah cried the whole time
hes miserable
I had to bring him in the backyard
soon as I brought him in the backyard
funny
oh it was so funny
he wouldnt hang out with the kids well so it was a bit
there wasnt any chairs for him either there was no chairs
he had to bring his own high chair
there he is sitting in his high chair all the kids are sitting in regular chairs oh because its an older kid too hes five years old
oh okay
so
but Tyson just as soon as I walked in
screaming wah
daddy daddy
cry cry cry cry cry
so I brought him in the backyard they have a cubby house with a little sandpit under it
uhhuh
so he played there with his with trucks for so long he loved that and he finally sort of calmed down
and then later on the kids were playing a game in the backyard with balloons and then the balloons started popping and he did the same thing
wah
miserable cry cry cry cry
well we got to go bye
things to look forward to
uh well thats not he he you know that they they hire back alot of their people who ah graduate there thats because they got alot of money in the bank
yeah
and there thats the only university that does that
yeah but I mean the fact that he he actually did get an academic position that thats ah because all those people who went off all sort of bright eyed
now theres another guy who went ah down to U S C uh
yeah the only the only person I know who made it for literature was a guy name McCan who might be at Cornell
yeah hes still around Ive seen his name pop up here and
yeah but Ramses vanished
uh hes supposed to be in Japan from what Ive heard but he you know he he fell into a trap uh he could never get tenure
yeah well he was at Columbia and ah
yeah well he was he was there for like five years and they turned him down for tenure then he went somewhere else he was down in College Park Maryland
yeah
and ah he was I think he was only ah non tenure track down there there is supposedly supposed to be back in Japan now
yeah
but you know hes a hes probably you know become an English teacher at some univ
yeah
I know a guy believe it or not I knew a guy from Manhattan whos up in Sapporo his
uhhuh
major he w did an M B A
uh believe it or not hes an hes an English teacher now
huh
he got a a sort of well it they dont really have tenure you know foreigners dont have tenure in Japan but you know it sort of like a long term teaching position
yeah
uh you know after I taught at that university and I dont in a way I dont envy him
yeah
no the E S L people are are second class citizens
I I well you should see what the Japanese students
after they torture them for six years in middle school and high school they dont want to do anything in college particular
yeah oh you see the Korean students are the same way no it it doing the teaching at Rutgers are are are Koreans and Japanese are not leading the class by
by any means
yeah well they they you know they want to relax for a couple of years and
try try giving some lectures about um you know its its great you brought your body to class but you must remain conscious
well they biggest problem I had was trying not to flunk them I had to I had to recycle the same questions two or three times to get them to pass
um
but to have humiliating for the teacher you know just
yeah
you know I I I told my friend who had taught there youknow I said well you know I I gave them the questions once and I youknow two thirds of them failed
so I gave them the same questions almost all the same questions again and they said
and half of them failed so sometimes you have to give them the same questions three times
yeah yeah thats thats a
ah you know you know that kind of teaching position I can live without
yeah
as a matter of fact Ive got Ive got a couple good possibilities now I told you
mhm
uh one is ah you know doing media type ventures
mhm
and Im negotiating with them
yeah
and theres this ah computer thing
hm
ah coming up in march and believe it or not they want me to be the president
huh
of the company
well you can be the next ah Bill Gates
excuse m
youll be the the next Bill Gates
wow you know when you start talking about C E O you get all sorts of privileges with that you know like a car driver you know house
yeah
big ah you know big fat salary so
well well look forward to ah Cyrilsoft ninety seven
no its actually the ah its this that that remember about that new operating system I was telling you about thats in Japa
o no
uh well I I told you that several months ago
uhhuh
uh and theyre going to theyre going to Koreanize it
oh yeah
so theres a ne
there are I I was looking at a Korean ah American bulletin board and there is some sort of Korean system out thats been developed in the States I dont know what
no no this this is the professor who developed this one is
yeah
uh the one in the States is probably to work on Unix or something you know the ah its a its difficult to send messages in Korean across the internet
yeah
and Ive got a copy of you know that ah Yudora for English
yeah
uh but I cant you know people try to send me foreign language messages and get all these nonsense characters on my screen
well well there are yeah well there are some ah there is some going on because ah some of the on the Korean bulletin board some of the messages you pick it up and get just
you know it what amounts to code it looks like ah the Rutgers system is ah I only discovered that theres certain unmarked computers that will receive pictures and if
they dont receive pictures and you either get a message that we cant accept this or instead of um instead of a picture youll get alphabet and numbers you know its sort of over and over again
yeah mhm
and ah some of the Korean messages have been like that and and ah apparently theyre theyre not pornographic theyre just um its its the ah
you could probably decode it if you could you know work out the sit down and work out the pattern but ah
there is they are sending some kind the Korean Americans are using some kind of system here
yeah they probably dual serve anyway this this new thing is for that architecture my friend in Tokyo did
mhm
he didnt command the legs hu
mhm
sometimes not as much as he would like to be but
hes doing really good
and hes Now I think that hes got kind of control
uhhuh
hes much sweeter
uhhuh
yeah he seems to be have a well I mean he was sweet before but
well its a frustrating process to be always falling down hu
yeah and now hes usually better now hes pretty fussy but oi
yeah
so how have you bee
work and Elizabet
and
yeah that was a hard trip
uh shes not at all well matter of fact
I wouldnt be surprised to get a phone call anytime
oh reall
yeah she was wanting to die while we were there
really
yeah shes had her fourth stroke and
oh gosh
theres alotof pain on her left side and she cant walk without a walker and she cant go but a few steps and
mm
so she lives on the in a chair and on couch and back in her hospital bed right there within a few feet of each other
mm
and a shes so used to being you know up and busy and in control and able to do and
and she can
no
so shes finishing her autobiography and then
uh
wanting to die but not not lifting off so shes pretty angry and irritable
wondering whats the hold up
yeah
but her mother died ah f four years after having a stroke so
oh yea
yeah so
shes not not supposed to die yet evidently
yeah its not time well thats
a rough trip but
yeah but Laura was able to help her with the book a bit you know by her sort of secretly wanting her to read it
and tell what sections are where and
and I was packing up things for her to send to people she wants to youknow things for her family and things
oh yeah
it was kindof a hard and sad trip in that way but we went ah she sent us off to Sonoma one day we went up to Sonoma
and thats nice
uhhuh
we just
aw
we were so wretched hot we just sort of stayed in the car and drove
Drove off to the sights you kno

yeah
but still I looked on the least last night still didnt a hundred down there
uhhuh
so its been ah
ninety or a hundred for a month now down there
jeez
down there
and its been today and yesterday was the first day in a long time that weve had it less than a hundred or ninety
and so its in the eighties and it feel marvelous
wow
and so we finally get some relief from the weather
its like autumn here
I mean

yeah its about fifty fifty five
yeah thats right youre all ready youve got a short summer huh so its all ready

and um its kindof a cultural show
uhhuh inter
to
view the American
yeah and we do like little skits on like how um Americans react to things differently than other cultures and
oh neat
Finnish culture so we like do the subway scene of Americans in the subway and Finns in the subway
theyre pretty funny
Ill bet that was fun hu
yeah I think itll be pretty interesting it doesnt air starting until January fifteenth but
its pretty fun I think because they had French and German and Asian and
Ill be interested to see how they put it all together
yeah
um yeah see how it ends up so
so will will it be in Finnish or
no
well we spoke in English but its like a Finnish documentary
its a Finnish documentary but it has all these sections to i
yeah
yeah neat
yeah like different parts of movies and stuff so were Im going to see if I can get my American friend to tape it
neat
Yammi and I are saving up for one of those V C R s that have the mode so maybe by then well have one we can tape it and
yes
it seems interesting what theyre doing so
yeah so itll be a cross culture center hu
yeah and theyre paying me so its like
is that righ
yeah I thought its pretty nice
yeah
pays to be a foreigner sometimes I guess
not all the time but sometimes
yeah right
so thats what weve been doing here just kind of Yammis been taking a few days off while I go and
oh so it was a not just a little thing then huh
well it was just a couple times just went a couple times and
oh
uhhuh
then if they want to use me later or something theyll call
oh neat
yeah but its pretty fun neither of us could act
well was it like a Helsinki station o
no its a Finnish station
oh
on T V one and
hm
so its
just for the Alexi honey come here sweetie
he got he got the door shut and hes kind of cranky now
do you want to get hi
yeah hold on just a second
0
okay I forgot its free so you dont have to
thats right
we were worried so much
mhm
about it but
you wou you wouldve love this house we saw honey
oh yeah
it was unbelievable
Frank Lloyd Wrights hu
yeah
aw
it it would be nice to live in now you know
yea
and it was built in nineteen oh two
and its probably modern looking
yeah
as it would seem to me
yeah yeah it was just gorgeous
aw
and that glass in extraordinary art glass throughout in the the ah chandeliers in the dining room were butterfly design and
oh wow
there were butterfly designs in the door coming in
and just just gorgeous
wow
built for sixty thousand dollars
really
back in nineteen oh two
yeah a while back I think
wow
it would have been nice to see
I I really enjoy that calendar
yeah
you guys sent the Frank Lloyd Wright calendar
yeah
looking at it I like it
alotof people have made comments about whos this you know who did thi
hm
coolest FrankLloydWright
but yeah I looked into a masters program here
yeah
in and
they cost seventy thousand marks a year
huh
so thats like wha
twenty four thousand or somethin
youre kidding
no
I thought whoa
thats pretty steep considering all the other educations free here yeah
yeah so whats whats the dea
well its especially for
private school
well no but it they dont have masters program
does kind of its new starting out this year and its
designed to fit the States idea of undergrad and masters program you know
uh
so Im going to see about trying to just get into the regular
school and trying to continue like maybe next year or something but
yeah
so being a Finnish citizen or being married to a Finnish citizen doesnt help you in that way that
well not for that masters program it doesnt but for just going if I wanted just to take classes
to receive a Finnish degree which is equivalent to a masters
Alexi come here hold on dad Im sorry
okay
0
okay sorry
hey mister Alexi
nap time
hes getting kindof cranky Ill let him bang on the keyboard a little bit but
Im going to take a Finnish course and see how that goes
well thats probably the next step anyway isnt i
yeah
get good at your Finnish huh
for me mhm
and Im so itll be nice get started and
see how that goes then um I tried to send you guys cards
couple weeks ago and realized that I didnt have your address
oh you want to write it dow
yeah
what is i
fifty one fifty eight
Hawthorn Drive
Hawthorn Drive okay
thats four six two two six isnt i
two two six
six
okay thanks
Because
we had it all ready and then
went to look and I was like I have their phone number and thats it
so
I bought you a little coffee cup from Tullyesa and I still havent gotten it in the mail so
Youd never know it though she was a workaholic and really a very uh very very attractive woman you know
but but anyway so what else it new you know
well lets see our construction has started
oh yeah hows hows that problem you had with the
and
thats solved now expensive but it was solved
it was eh yeah I know you were telling me
so very expensive
yeah hm
involving a tremendous amount of money but its solved and
yeah
but you were thinking of suing the person at the
well
the cost of suing eh you know i its muddy lawyers seem think its not really
what was it
you know eh if its not
not not very happy about doing
oh
oh really
ho how you making out with your exlaw your la
oh my case uh hes trying to my lawyer is trying to get
Bills lawyer to get together with a lawyer for Index Futures and see if they can come up with a settlement
mhm
but so far no he says typically settlements are like on the very last day
you know on the youre sitting on the steps waiting for the judge and thats when they settle you know
yeah whe when when when you going to cour
but in a
uh well it he thinks its going to be postponed originally I was telling you it was October sixteenth
mhm
now he thinks it
more than likely it wont be till sometime in the middle of December
oh jesus
so try to keep a date open well Ill well try to let you know what the date is because he he he really would prefer to either have you there otherwise hell videotape you
yeah
uh but now hes hes thinking itll probably be delayed till
I dont know he its not delayed yet but the but he but the brokerage house isnt answering the questions he asks
does he is he still as confident as ever that there will be some sort of a
well hes no hes very confident that well win against Phil
a meaningful settlement
but hes not
sure that well win against Index Futures because he said theres its as far as he could see theres no real precedent for that
mhm
in the next for this particular case he theres no precedent
but Phils lawyer was probing around saying well what do you really want
you know so he said
see we dont want to settle with Phils lawyer
prior to settling with Index Futures
you know what I mean
oh it seems Index Futures is deep pocket
yeah yeah so he doesnt want to settle with him first so he said to Phils lawyer he said why dont you go
get together with Index Futures though by the way they got a new lawyer they went outside now theyre not using their own lawyer
oh is that right
they went outside to another firm in Chicago
and so he said to him go get together with him and see what you guys can come up with you know
in the meantime theyre bringing in two experts so we got to bring in an expert too thats going to cost a few thousand dollars
jesus
the expert is to say see their
you have to p do you have to pay that or does that come out of the settlement
eh I pay the expenses
hm
so the expert
Jesus how much you got in this thing already must be like ten thousand dollars in already Ill bet
well not not much no not so much thirty five hundred for him
the lawyer
mm
eh so far in expenses maybe
maybe fifteen hundred so far
oh thats not bad
but the but the the big expense would be this expert
the ex we got to fly him in from Chicago probably
put him up overnight and pay him
how do you how do you find an expert like that Ani
I dont know hes going to find him he asked me if I knew anyone I didnt
uh because theres no commodity of experts in Philly
most of them are in Chicago
uh possibly NewYork or Washington
mhm
but mostly Chicago
eh anyway he said hell try to find one and actually he wants someone who works for a commodities firm
and theres a possibility theyre all incahoots together you know they dont tes
yeah thats thats I was just thinking the exact same
that they dont testify against each other
yeah thats what had
but
but see theyre bringing in two experts to say that its common
business practice to give those
they admit that they gave Phil those internal printouts
but they said its common business practice to give them to substantial customers
but on the one hand theyre arguing that Phil
oh Im sorry Bernice Bernice told me
Bernice says tell me that she can get that program with
that girl on it
oh you can
yes
its on Life yeah so Jessica Savage its on eight to ten and then I think an hour after that is a documentary
yeah
very she must be pretty famous person
well she was
how old was sh how old was she she when she died
huh
oh she was
I dont know she was probably in her forties or something
is that right ohgod what a shame
fifties maybe
but but anyway she she was already you know big time she was with a network she was with N B C
yeah
she had gone off the local news on to the
oh so she really made the big time then
yeah and then she died she was in a restaurant which weve been to in New Hope you know not far
and
its actually very tricky we we u
when when I heard about the accident I realized that it could easily happen
there was a
oh I forget what it was there was a very tricky turn when you leave the restaurant
and they failed to make that turn and I think I forget exactly how th
she died as a result of it you know
yeah
but but I remember that too and I said you know I always get got confused when I left that restaurant that you could
easily make a bad turn
but anyway
I guess it was her boyfriend that was driving and I dont u I cant remember the details anymore but they thats how she got killed
hm
you know
but anyway you had to be there for fifteen minutes because thatll it because its going to go on in about three minutes
so if you wanted to see it you know
yeah if oh well in fifteen minutes we got to be on in fifteen minutes
yeah yeah
were on were on
so what else is new so you getting ready for right
yeah oh yeah
yeah we sent ours I sent it in we ha we have to make
we we still didnt make the reservations with a
hotel we have to do that
oh yeah thats where were going to stay also but
yeah and I dont know lets see what else is new Pearl is not too well
ohgod isnt that ohgod thats such a
yeah she shes not too well
ohgod
and we s we spoke to Jackie last week
she won her case you know in the
you know shes getting out of London
unemployment
Judy won hers too but the guy
is appealing it
hm
hes what
she Judy had also won her case for unemployment but theyre appealing it the the firm is appealing it
Ill be a son of a bitch are they really
but in the mean
yeah but in the meantime Judy got a job so theyre only talking about
like six weeks worth of checks you know
yeah tell me let me ask you a question does she have hospitalization this new job
I don
eh
yeah but they so far they havent specifically told her what she gets she has to pay for part of it which is typical nowadays
yeah
most companies dont give you full hospitalization anymore
yeah we do but were going to start changing too its eh its getting so damn expensive
yeah
most companies are making the employees pick up
uh you know up to half of it for whatever
and I just finished you know remember I I got a one time job with a f
yeah Bernice was telling me
stayed at Delaware
and they were tr real nice I enjoyed every every minute of it and I I went up there and turned it over to them
last Thursday
great
and then theyre going to call in the
theyre going to call me in for a review
uh
and I I it depends how the review goes I dont know whos going to be there to go over it with me
they so typically they make you redo some of it you know or whatever they make you
spend more time on it
but that was ni that was real nice I enjoyed it and
and it was nice money for the time spent yeah
so far I havent received the money but I you know I think
I think I dont have any fears about that you know
oh thats great yeah if that that if you get a few more of those they
yeah
yeah oh jeez a couple
what you do it where did you work to do it
at home
at home
I own my own computer
eh it was real nice I mean I really well mostly it wasnt even computer work it was mostly just my thoughts getting my thoughts out it was something I had done
before at M C I and at Western Union
and my friends eh
that said thats what they wanted and so I you know it was something I felt very comfortable with
and I already did the
the project and I mean eh eh they just wanted the specification for someone else to program it and I I wrote up the specification I drew up
oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts
hm
which isnt exactly what he wanted but thats like old fashioned flow chart but the guy
the guy that I ga gave turned it over to he just had me spend an afternoon explaining it to him
and he didnt seem opposed to the way I did it
and my friend said hes the fussiest guy Id have to worry about
but he seemed okay
so now its just a few other managers there theyre going to you know get together probably have me back again and explain it again
yeah
tell me whats happened to Gary in his interviews
oh were real hopeful he tomorrow we probably will find out more he has two
potential jo potential teach teaching jobs
oh good
One is
Pleasantville New Jersey which were not too happy about because its black and its very rough
but theyre the ones who called him back
for a second interview
and they said it was narrowed down to four people
mhm
well so he has a one out of four chance I guess
but
the the town is all black you know its near Atlantic City
and its no
what town is it
its Pleasantville New Jersey its all
oh yeah suresure thats black
its its its all black and it
is that right
its its tough its a tough school
so
It would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldnt necessarily live there but I on the other hand it may not be great experie the other one is Edison New Jersey but they
what we dont like about that is thats a nicer area probably but uh and its only a couple hours from here
hed have to relocate either way
but Edison
the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about a permanent position
then hes saying well theyre trying to get rid of one teacher they have and if theyre not able to get rid of that teacher
he would be more of a long term sub on per diem
hm
so he changed the story from a first time to the second time
anyway hes supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow
and
if he gets the
I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it
because it is a regular
fulltime job even though it might not be the great the great school
but it depends what they come back with at Edison too so tomorrow hes suppos
but a also it seems to me if you can survive the Pleasantville job
youd certainly a great uh on your resume
yeah eh yeah that he was a full that he was a fulltime teacher
sure
and anytime he can look for others everybody in the school is black everybody they were interviewing were black the principal is black
really
eh yeah its its like a
eh its just about a totally black community now
no kidding
and anyway the more he hears about the community the more he hears its not so great its not
not as bad as the big city black areas but its
well you said hes not going to live in Pleasantville
no no he could live
you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in Egg Harbor or uh
you know it could be
do we dr do we drive through Pleasantville driving down to Atlantic City Philadel
yeah well if you take the Black Horse Pike youre passing right through Pleasantville
oh thats wonderful now is Virgil finally retired also or
well he retired from the university you know he but hes been working up at the base and
oh yeah
hes still working up there
is he
the base has closed but hes with the base conversion agency
and they expect that to go on for about one more year although
all the buildings now are occupied I think except one he said it its gone really much faster than they thought
so but they have clean up to do and
transfer deeds and everything so he said it looks like its going to take about one more year
to wind everything up
well I hope they know what theyre doing
I know its really sad you know to because that was such a nice base
yeah well thats the way it is out here the ones are closing and just hope we dont need them again
I know its its kind of scary in a way but
yeah it is
I dont know and its costing so much to you know put it back so that they can sell it you know they have to do so much clean up
to the soil and everything it is just a lot of expense
yeah mhm
yeah it is
but
so hows your family
hes great yeah so far as I know
wheres john now
hes still in Ohio he was home for about three weeks in august
he came home the first of august and was here till the twentieth
is he married now
no no oh hes still working on that phd he just has his dissertation to write its his
kind of up to him now how long he spends doing that you know
uhhuh whats he studying or whats he
hes psychology counselling yeah hes working
psychology
well it thats thats a long haul
hes counselling you know hes counselling at the college level and he likes that
uhhuh
but he doesnt know what there will be available or what he really wants to do when he finally gets the phd
which he hopes to have within the next year
oh Im sure hell hell find something that has a need for that I think
yeah I think so and hes pretty sensitive and I think hell do a pretty good job
mhm
oh
and how is Karen is she teaching this year
oh yes shes like you shes ready to retire
well you know the way the way education has gotten I I dont know how a teacher can last until retirement age now
its just that its its not fun anymore
unhunh it isnt
she said that all the teachers complain the same they work harder and harder all the time and
every year it gets it more and more demands are put on you
oh
and the kids are getting worse too theres just so much seems like hostility and anger
and and then the the parents some of them expect so much
oh
that you know youve got thirty five kids in a classroom you cant give each child the individual attention that the
no
parents thinks their child should have you cant do it
I know
they dont have teachers aids anymore so they just cant
and shes got thirty five wow
yeah and and no aid you know you just you
thats ridiculous well what theyre doing here now no I dont know whether theyre doing that in California or not theyre putting all the special Ed kids back into the classroom
theyre doing a lot of that too
I mean we at Franklin last year which is a middle school we had a student that could hardly speak probably a hundred words and yet she was in the
regular classroom making straight a
oh no
oh no
I mean she
it just doesnt make sense
unhunh no
I just I dont know what we can do about it
I dont either
they could just keep saying theres not money enough you know and the funds arent there
but now this this child had her personal aid that went with her all day long
but you know I I I just have well thats one reason I quit teaching is because
well I mean main reason I quit was because I was just tired and ready to do something else but
even if I had been ten years younger
You know people have gotten out of Japan more
uhhuh but youre talking big city Chiba though
Youre talking commercial David
mm yeah but fun yeah
yeah
yeah big city
I like the big city
yeah well wh wh why did you take the prefecture that they gave you the
uh well there was only one choice at the time I interviewed
oh reall
yeah
uhhuh
Where its like what youre doing
You have m youre you have time and
Right
You can pick and choose more and you should definitely get a job with an air conditioner in your apartment
well how will I know that Davi
You You ask Therese
an
Is there an apar air conditioner in my apartmen
say just David said that its very hot in the summer
Right

Shes going to work with me hu
yeah
Shell work with you on that
huh
All right
You dont have a roommate righ
No Its all single apartments
uhhuh
So thats good
And how big is your apartmen
As big as the room that you had her
uh bit a little bigger than that
and then you have the kitchen off to the side
yeah
yeah great
First floo
Im on the second floor
second floor
okay
You dont have a problem with w with bringing girls back to your apartment or anythin
No theres no no nobody here like that to watch over
I me I mean I got a letter from several Indonesian schools and and they explicitly say
hey look no females
oh yeah
I told you that righ
Didnt I read you tha
Loo No but thats Indonesia
yeah I read the addendum to you
Well I I got a job offer from Indonesia
And they went okay just sign the papers we lo wed love to have you
Come on out
Noproblems
by the way heres an addendum
Some of our teachers have complained about the following things in the past
hm
and and they wanted to list like six of them
One six thirty A
M
classes two
um the the fact that
that the school holds your passport the entire time that youre working for them
ah
Three the fact that youre not allowed to have opposite members of the sex in your room
ah and they just listed like six things that were like holy cow where am I
and like no one would want to go
You well and a apparently thats what was happening
They were like hiring these people
These people were getting over there on these false pretenses
saying oh yeah I want to teach in Indonesia
Its going to be great
and then and then having all these rules and regulations thrown on them
mm
That a a apparently they were signing year contracts and lasting like a month
Right
and so so they finally put this addendum into their contract and said hey look
Lets let you know about this ahead of time because
Were tired of you know bringing people over and having them quit on us
hm
But yeah
Its not going to change
But its not going to change
Rob I mean no ones going to go now going to go now
Sorry
No one will go
Exa well yeah Im sure people will still David theres people out there that are teaching English for free
yeah
Theres people that will go to that will go to Indonesia go oh yeah Bali ho lets go
yeah
I mean you
Sure the Mormon Church too
yeah youve got David you must have you must have
You must have a hundred schools in Japan alone
People are working for free
I mean I just saw a couple of advertisements already in one of this magazines I get
called Transitions Abroad
Volunteers wanted for Japan
hm
Theyre booked solid
Christian programs
Mormon programs Y M C A programs
like Y M C A P
Theyre taking volun hu
Y M C A P
I dont know what it is
yeah
But but theyre taking people by the bundles
and theyre just theyre just giving them a visa and then a place to stay you know a dorm room and theyre eating it up
hm well
They are eat
Theyre probably going in the poor house too
Well yeah
Because its expensive here
Sure sure you even you even got some people that are paying David
Theres an organization called Worldteach
People are paying to teach English
yeah
Theyre paying a thousand dollars
yeah I dont get that
I dont get
I dont understand that
I dont enjoy teaching that much
No they got to pay me to teach
yeah these people are paying
Anyway yeah thats about it
I mean Im Im going over there and Im going to be looking
You know what I cant believe Davi
I cannot believe
hm
Nobody from South America and nobody from Europe wrote back and said hey MisterBrilly at least youre a schmuck
We dont want you
They didnt even have the balls to write me back
Got it down east Europe
hu
Poland Hungary
I didnt apply to Poland Hungary or Bulgaria
I think I
Poland and Hungary are the places you can get work easiest
Sure but David comeon lets be realistic
Its like five thousand dollars a year
Right an and who the heck wants to live in Poland or Czechoslovakia
Well could could you enroll in two other courses if you wanted t
In addition to the one youre already in are there two other things that youd also like to tak
For example
I dont know what the limit is for
I know theres a limit for
students who e
uh a limit for wha
You know Im thinking alot about this job that I just took that
you know you seem to think is a dead end and obviously doesnt make enough money and you know I dont know Im going to like it
You dont know that going into a job
Theres
I understand that
Well tha
I understand that
Youve taken it and thats a
I feel like I just made a big mistake
Liz I cant tell you whether you did or not
It just feels lousy
And I just tried for the longest time to figure out what to do
Liz Liz I dont know whether you made a mistake or not
I cant possibly tell
And I
and I d I dont even have enough information to say whether you did or not
And you will find out
And if its a b huge mistake youll just quit thats all
You have no way of knowing
Did you tell the public health people that you definitely dont want that jo
No I didnt tell them anything
oh okay
Is that e is that really such an awful jo
Sounded to me like alotof interesting things
Sounded to me like too much but it sounded like a very interesting
set of things
Is that something you definitely d would not want to d
You had said that was an eas
I
You had said you had said that was an easier job in some ways
Wha
Actually I dont think so anymore because I think that its too many things
Are y are you going to have to for either one of them are you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that you actually get paid fo
I I dont know yet
Because I dont think that that would be warranted
at at at the salary that theyre giving you
I I think that you ought to be able to circumscribe your hours very carefully
I just got this call yesterday from this I mean I j
Liz
it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this
nurse at a high school
nearby
saying I should call her about openings in the district that she called me because
of one of the letters I wrote to one of the principals
oh yea
who knows what kinds of openings there are
mhm
mhm
So may
Lizzy I know how up in the a you know when I was in graduate school I I spent alotof time in my last year of c college
thinking about whether w wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to teach little kids
And
I I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go into biophysics but also have my own little kids
But I went into biophysics
By the end of the year Id met Daddy and I decided that was going to be it
I really wanted to
i I really Daddy was really going to be the one
I got
very unhappy with the science
and
I just walked out of one lab and I said no this is it
I just dont want it
I wanted to be teaching little kids
Because Daddy was at that point noncommittal
to say the least
And and he was also leaving for Syracuse
And so a friend of mine sat down with me Wayne Meyers and he said he was a very bright
guy
He was the one I cried whose shoulder I cried on when I took Dexadrin that time too for
the doctor had given it to me for cramps and I
ended up getting depressed for twenty four hours
um
and
he said to me
you really want to change
I said yeah I really want to go
He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon
because I had already applied and been accepted to the I mean it went so far that I w I applied both to biophysics
and to Harvard School of Ed
And I didnt apply to any other ed schools because I figured I could get in in there which I had
And I went across the river that day
and I said can I get into your next years class
And they said absolutely
And I mean by then it was like May
Certainly April
Certainly April not
not not earlier
And
I remember Mama Sadie was upset about it
But everybody knew why I was doing it and everybody kn e it was obvious even to Daddy why I I just had to
I had to do that for a while
I couldnt just study science for a while
And
I was twenty two
twenty one
And and
yeah I guess I was twenty two already
um and
a and
and a a its its not any rational kind of thing Liz
Its hormonal
Its absolutely hormonal
I mean here you are you are thirty
And its no wonder
its no wonder that that that you dont know what you want to do
I didnt know what I wanted to do at that stage
Well I did but it was out of reach
And for you its obviously out of reach too
Unless it works out with Matt
you havent met him
And therefore
Im Im
I I
I Im disappointed in how youre going about it
because I dont see I dont see I mean
I I I I Ive Ive known so many people who didnt get married and so many people who got married too late to have children
Its very
sad
I find it very sad
I didnt expect that I would be in this position
with my children
Well
actually I expected it with Jonathan
I expected to worry about him not you
because he was very slow socially
And and and you know you never can tell with life
There arent any rules about it
and th nobody has nobody has written the future
And its not really its its eh prayer and
eh penitence doesnt really help
Its going to happen things are going to happen when it happen they happen
But you have to there there are ways to help them along
There are ways to help them along
And maybe youre doing them but I dont see it
I know you went out with some guy the other night
May maybe you are looking actively but I I dont see it
So all I can do is sit and worry
and be concerned
and
I dont
think that you would
Can we talk about the job things no
that
Well what about the job thing
I I cant talk about them
I dont know anything about them
You want to tell me about the
Well you dont like the job I just took
Now wait a moment
Dont
Well Daddy says theyre less important than the other stuff and I agree
But dont tell me I dont like the job you just took Lizzy
I dont know enough about it
You know I raised you and
I I thought I was
So maybe I can sign
ten hours in the school district doing something else
Maybe you can
eh its its
that would be that would be interesting if
you know you have hours during the week that are available
Dont dont dont block them out until you find out whether or not you can take a a an art course during the week
so that you can have your I mean I you know Id like to see you flying down to
where was it that they had that hiking group
SanFrancisco for the for the weekends
mhm
I want to fly out to Michigan and visit Matt
Thats where I want to fly
uh Id like to see you do that too
All I want is your happiness Liz
And I think I know what will make you happy
Well I just want to figure out what I want to do with my life
You know I feel like Im never going to figure it out
Lizzy you might not
I havent figured out mine yet
Youre a scientist
Im a scientist Liz thats a pretty poor showing for a scientist
Ma are you kiddin
Look how many days you go into the lab
I know
Look what Ive published
One paper
So who cares about publishing
Well thats what otherwise otherwise I Im Im cooking and nobodys eating it
Its its recycling its
its work working that nobody nobody ever knows about
Thats not what defines me as a person
What defines me as a person is is is my family
And your failure daughter
Thats what Im feeling sad about at the moment
I just Im not going to be able to figure out what I want to do
I just didnt know
I thought this might be interesting okay
And and maybe
Thats fine
I dont thats not my big thats not my big worry about you Liz
But it its its mine
And I feel like I didnt know what to do and then I feel like I took it and now I feel like its a mistake and now I
Well Im Im telling you Im telling you its hormonal
Its not rational
what to do
You dont just all of a su the heavens dont open up as Gib
wrote and and all of a sudden you know just what youre going to do
If you define yourself that way
youre youre youre youre youre youre looking for trouble
But I just feel like Im
Youre opening yoursel
puttyduddying around for the rest of my life
And I dont even have like I dont have any specific
skills or body of knowledge
Im just sort of this
blob
Lizzy
Lizzy the mo Lizzy Daddy feels that way too
He feels he doesnt know anything
Everybody feels that way
You just have to get used to that
You want to count your degree
You want to count the courses youve ha
You want to count the work youve done the jobs youve ha
Thats nonsense
I dont know
Like maybe if I were a teacher then I would
Everybody always
you know and I taught
say
health science and art then I would sort of get this body of knowledge that I would have and this
Lizzy
structure to it
And then I
yeah yeah Lizzy Lizzy
give it
Lizzy thats a dream
It never happens
And I can tell you people at all levels
The only people who really think they know something
are the people who usually are deficient
When you dont know know how mu
But theres
people who have a specific set of skills
I dont even feel like I have that sometimes you know
its
what they have to offer
I dont have anything to offer
yeah becau we we we because you because you cant
eh Lizzy Lizzy everybody feels that way whose worth his salt
Do you know tha
Is wha
blah blah blah
yeah
you know its like having a roommate
yeah
yeah
but
but you got to do what you got to do right
mhm
yup
is there any way you could get
like do they have day jobs
you know
it would be too hard to I wouldnt make enough money
at the restaurant
for day care and stuff
to pay yeah its crazy
yeah thats true
yup
thats right
and theres really nothing else that I could do
yeah
you know and I dont think oh I dont know
yeah
I Id like not having to work during the day
yeah
yeah
because I
so in a way it works out but it
yeah
its just hard
and then hes taking a class another a class this semester
yeah
yeah
and that starts tomorrow
so
so you know there goes monday nights again
theres another day
yeah
yeah
so
and its its hard you know having the kids all day too with no break
yeah
I mean I dont know how
how you ever did it but
well I was never with them during the day
I just
I get crazy thats true and you had them at night
yeah
yeah
thats one thing though
just being
around more
yeah
has been so nice for us
yeah
yup
you know
at least for me I dont know if it is for them I cant
right
well they probably hate it
speak for them
yup
but you know I I look back and I think of all the things that I missed
when they were babies you know when they were just little tiny guys
yeah
right even like a bad day with me is at least its a bad day with me
yeah
you know Im their mom
yeah
yep
but
mhm
so
hopefully I can
work a little less
yeah
and then
that would be
maybe that will be a little bit better
yeah
but
especially I mean you know leaving to go to work at four oclock is just Im tired already
yeah
Im like ready for a nap
yeah
uhhuh
I want to like be home making supper and
yup
and then and thats when I have to leave

and go wait on people
yeah
yeah
of all things
yeah
my god
watch other people have a nice supper
yeah
shit
its awful
yup
yuck
and waitressing is
its hard man I
its hard work
you know and its a thankless job if you if youve never waited tables and there are so many people that have never waited tables
thats
it is
yeah
mhm
yup
you know they just have no clue and
yeah
like
you know Im not your little fucking servant Im just
yup
yeah
Im here to do my job and Im trying to be nice to you

Suzy smiles and

yuck
thats why well whenever we go out I always make sure
that I leave a tip
yeah
you know unless
the service is really lousy
yeah
and then she knows it you know I mean she knew she what she did
mhm
right
but if they give any effort at all they get a good tip its just
right
yeah
yup
I wouldnt want to have to be doing this right now so thank you for doing it for me you know
right
right
exactly
I didnt want to cook tonight so somebody there did you know
yeah
yup
but
yeah I dont know
but were were hanging in there
are you
yeah
yup
its tough though
it is
but
we had a big huge garden this year
oh did you
yeah we made tomato sauce today
oh neat
oh cool
yeah its
bubbling away on the stove
oh bet your house smells wonderful
it smells so good
god
I just remember your house from when we were there
yeah yup
I just love that house
that kitchen
yeah
you know the kitchen was the focal point in the whole house you know it was just
yup
mhm
comfortable place to settle and you know it was just neat
yup
and it smells good and
yep
I made
a couple of times I made bread and butter pickles
oh did you oh good
yup
and
thats wonderful
I made a blueberry lime jam
ooh
and the first time I made it it came out perfect
uhhuh
but then I made it again like last week and it didnt come out right and I was so mad
oh
so did you have to just dump the whole thing out
well I I havent thrown it away yet because it
it just
try to
didnt get thick enough
oh okay
but its still like good on pancakes
oh yeah
and stuff like that
yeah make it like syrup instead
so
its like a sauce yeah
yeah
cool
but and its its really I dont know if youve ever canned anything ever but its just
unhunh
nope
and when you do something wrong you dont know what you did wrong and
mhm
and why it and you dont know if its going to come out
you know
yeah
until it comes out or it doesnt come out
yeah
yeah till youre done with it yeah
and then its like
fuck man you know I wasted all this time and energy and effort my kitchen is like a freaking
yup
sauna
yup
shit
and it didnt come out right
I mean you know
doesnt Jeanette
do canning and stuff
oh I dont know she might
she does because she sent me some jellies
does she
yeah
for christmas last year
yeah
so she might know
probably yeah
yeah
but
it was fun to you know try it and then you know you just get discouraged and its like I dont want to ever do this again
yeah
yeah
uhhuh
yup
although they do look a li
a little Laura
What did Laura sa
Laura saw it
and an her her comments were that the commentators seem pretty high on the Skins
yeah
everyone did
actually she
although I have to say after the game last night
um beating Saint L or whatever Phoenix
oh
wha or Arizona whatever theyre called was certainly no great feat
I I know eh but Miami
they are awful
eh
Theyre really bad
Hows Penn doing
Penn is not yet it hasnt started
oh it hasnt started yet oh I didnt realize that
nope
but I will keep you
how come Lauras team started
I dont think we played this week
yeah the
No I think youre right the Ivies start later
see we dont play as many games
right
d how did Lauras do
Well
that figures
I havent heard from her
bu
Well write to her shell like that
I try its so hard mom you dont understand how little time I have to do anything these days
Yes I do
and its like impossible Ive been waiting to find a half an hour when I could call because I can only use like its like I have to use the whole half hour
and there hasnt been a time where I actually could just sit on the phone for a half hour
oh
oh We have to go talk for a half an hour you cant split it u
No
Not for free
oh
thats weird
Well this is something very important
We got the Washingtonian
yeah
uhhuh
and they sa
but did you get Playbo
Playbo
yeah a girl in my class is in it
What
I told you about that
A girl in my med school class is in this months Playboy
oh
oh I didnt realize that I thought it was a long time ago Playboy
No that was when she
she did the posing over the Summer
yeah
oh I see
but its this month
hm
Yes it was very funny at the train station yesterday
When Elliot went to go get his
what you called
Barons whatever
and Im like oh do they have Playboy here lets get it
yeah
eh
and everybody is looking at me
Do you know her
Wha
Do you know he
yeah
I know her well
shes a little bit weird
Shes beautiful
hm
This is strange doesnt that seem like a strange thing to do
Yes
I think so
I think its
I mean what kindof a reception did it ge
Mostly just like a gossipy
I mean you mean the actual picture
I mea i
No I I meant I no no I meant what youre saying just gossip
just as you
yeah just everybody talking about it
I think its a s a very peculiar way to launch your medical career
and I agree
anyway so what about Washingtonian
y
very foolish girl no its going to follow her thatll follow her forever
mhm
but what abo
It really might not be bad
oh come on
Its a good picture
yeah but is that the kind are going to want go to a doctor who has been a Playboy bunn
Youd be surprised what people will go to I didnt say I would but youd be surprised what
people will do
Well I w
Its its publicity
maybe going to med school was a great way to launch her career as a Playboy model
thats right
Is that what she said
no
anyway
So what about Washington
Well what was it no well what was
alright Washingtonian is alot more important
They said that Maid Brigade is a national franchise
So y you if you need a maid you can call Maid Brigade and you could get
ohgod
but I I already cleaned up my apartment
yeah but itll get dirty again believe me
But I told I wrote you about how Elliot cleaned it up this weekend didnt
But does he always want to do i
No and he didnt clean it like Maid Brigade would he just picked the papers up off the floor
I I sort of had a feeling that might be the case
He cleaned the ki he actually cleaned up the kitchen a little bit
di
and made and got brunch
that was especially good
Did you get my message about HongKong
that youll try
and that I should make su
no that
three days
How many days and all
yeah I think I get there around noon
Lau
and thats one of the three days
thats not in uh
if you get there noon that means you wont get like to a hotel and everything until
two three in the afternoon
thats days yeah
so you have the evening you have one evening
okay well I can do another day the problem is that like cuts down my time in Singapore
yeah tha
oh oh well hm
like I dont I dont have that much time I had to leave on Sunday
Do you have to make the do you have to make the decision that when you go to HongKong now I mean can you change the reservation with no cost later
Ive got until like the twentieth I think
no no no I mean once youve done it and youre coming out here and you decide you want to leave a day early
I thought you know how those things are I could probably go standby but the thing is the flights are really packed
they are
thats the trouble well well the packed flights I sure to Hong Kong might not be packed
right
granted
thats what I mean th th th you could move that par
except theres the flights from there to HongKong are the flights back to the States
and were talking like January first
Well thats true
yeah
and so thats when everybody goes back
but
But youre not going to change that
Youre right
No no not that youre missing the point
the point my point is a United flight from Singapore to Hong Kong
yeah
is one that goes Singapore HongKong U S
Itll be crowded yeah
um U S yeah
So those flights will still be tight
You wouldnt believe how much trouble I had getting reservations
oh
yeah I would
I believe it yeah
I figured
actually
Were having trouble
Now all the places are full because like Amy ha was wait listed I was wait listed to get to Japan
mhm
and then this this woman Leigh Turbush that
mhm
You know our friend here
Shes trying to go to Hawaii
on this week and shes been trying for weeks but she cant get on
well thats thats uh Japan Hawaii is is very crowded
mhm
yeah
Japanese are just
oof
uh really apparently travel
yeah but I mean the time of year doesnt matter
no apparently it doesnt matter
yeah
you should have heard it was amazing I called every airline as you know only I can do
right
and I called it was with much hesitancy that I called Continental
because I hate them so much
yeah
I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route I shouldve known that if it took her ten minutes I shouldve hung up
She had me st go from like Philadelphia to NewYork to San Francisco to L A
to Hawaii to Guam
to HongKong to Tokyo to Singapo I mean she had me
everywhere
I think theyre the only ones who go to
and shed for three thousand dollars
I was like are you joking
Uy
oh I have take fr
in a couple weeks I have to Guam and theyre the only ones that go there
the Continenta
Continental yeah
Thats funny
good luck can you at least go business class
I dont know if I can or not
yeah oh by the way you were right with Singapore Air its only business class or first class goes
Right miles
to frequent flyers
Right yeah
They go Singapore Air takes you around
through Europe
they do a route that way yeah
yeah thats how they like to go
if if I you know could have gone specially through HongKong
right
but that was more a little bit more expensive
and they they al they also have connections with Delta
yeah
they only give miles on Delta but you can buy Delta seats on there
right well thats they were actually they were going to send me on T W A
I almost thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the United because
uh fewer connections but I th instead of connecting in
eh well I mean it is alot further to go through Japan and all that nonsense
but the problem with Singapore Air is I have to through New York through J F K
Uy
which I now remember going from the domestic terminal to the international terminal
right
well T W A is not too bad
you have to walk a little bit but
yeah no I mean its just not
shi it just yeah
its not saving me much if I have to go through NewYork
but Tokyo is a bad place to layover
Tokyo is a ba and I have like an eight hour or five hour layover there
I know yeah usually yeah
five hours
Its crazy
Its not that bad by the time you slept its such a its really
No but its annoying that I have to go through Tokyo that I cant just fly from HongKong home
right
that is annoying
Im surprised you didnt go Hong Ko the the They do have route wheres does it go Tokyo to wher
SanFrancisco
yeah was it is or HongKong SanFrancisco
yes
but its full
United does have that
oh its full I see
at that the other I mean at that price level I could pay more probably
mm
which maybe Ill look it maybe Ill find out how much more I have to pay
Can you get on a waiting lis
Can you get on a waiting list
Ill find out when I call back to confirm
Yes its worth waiting l eh with HongKong SanFrancisco San Francisco is much better
wheres Tokyo take you to Tokyo to where
SanFrancisco I dont know if its the same old same old
oh oh no yes same thing yeah yeah
Well at least put yourself on the waiting list can you do tha
yeah probably but I have a feeling its like a price thing
Might not be
I dont know
yeah hows your sister doing
shes doing okay shes got a pretty bad cold right now but other than that she knows shes going to have a girl
she does
yeah shes having a girl
how far along is she
ho lets see shes due in January like the middle the I think her
due date is like the twelfth I think of January
so is she pretty much past her crucial period
well no actually her worst period is is the middle trimester
okay
which is you know usually its most everyones best one you know thats usually when you feel the best but thats her
most crucial time thats when supposedly the cervix could fall or she could have these other problems she still she has to go to the doctor every week
and they do ultrasounds on her every week
whos she going to
she sees doctor Ryder hes been her doctor for quite a while now he did you know took her through all of her biopsies and all the you know previous problems
yeah
and and so hes hes a specialist and hes hes pretty good she likes him real well so
oh yeah shes doing shes doing okay besides
you guys quit screaming
she still went out of town shes out of town for almost two weeks with work and then she just got so burnt out from it its crazy but and heather is in new York did you know that
what
heather is in new York with Brooke
yeah I heard that
you know
I bet youre not thrilled
well I said shes young you know she wants to go to new York and try a few things let her do it Id rather she you know gets
you know I mean let her try theres doesnt have anything stopping her theres nothing holding her here
well
she is coming back lets see must be I dont know sometime next week or so
her a friend of hers is getting married at the end of the month
that she has a return ticket so she can fly back and still use her ticket
Trevor get down babe
and then shes going to stay back for a couple weeks and get her stuff packed up and do whatever and then
and
does she have a job out there already
no I dont think so but then shes going to do that and get her stuff together and then move her stuff back
come on chubby you can come out and play toys with mom come on stinkerbox
you just want to do that
but so yeah then shes going to be back and then be back for Dianes wedding at the end of the month and then go
back to new York after that so I guess Brooke is coming back for it too so shes taking a bus or something
boy that would be a long haul
yeah its like I cant remember how many forty some hours I think on the bus
yeah
something like that it sounded awful
what was I going to oh tell don I didnt mean to be I just said is Kelly there I didnt say hi nothing but you can only talk to one person I said
oh
it doesnt they wont allow it or whatever so
oh no he
in the first minute you have to get the other person on and explain it kind of a
kind of a goofy thing but I thought well free phone call
yeah
so
oh so what have you been doing
oh babysitting Ive
how many kids
five
oh Karen
I know
but is in school all day
yeah Jordi started preschool and he goes in the afternoons
oh hows it
oh
its not going very good
oh how come
oh hes having problems behaving I guess
oh
he dont want to listen hes
so hyper I dont know well see hes only gone three days so and she never said nothing I asked her and then she
said something but which was I guess monday she had problems with him but
so well see
well you know the kids in Caseys kindergarten class are
I mean last year and its the same kids that got in trouble every day in kindergarten class are getting in trouble every day first grade class so you know
yeah
I mean I wouldnt worry about it because I think it just happens you know
so does he have Lindsay in his class
yes he does he was not very calm about it
hes like oh great in my well don had seen sandy when he was because he took Casey that first day
uhhuh
and had seen sandy and Casey came home and goes yeah shes in my class and then
must have been last week lee was coming to pick up
Lindsay and I said you know Ive meant to say something to you all last year and I didnt and you know said I dont know if you remember me blah blah blah blah blah and
hes like oh yeah we play volleyball together and so didnt we and I said yeah yeah so
so yeah theyre in class together and Casey was already pretty upset with Lindsay once I think theyve only gotten into it once
which is pretty good for them
because they moved up the round the teacher you know gave them new seat assignments and
Lindsay was going to be sitting next to Randy well Randys the sweetest little kid he gets in trouble because he just talks talks talks nonstop but hes just the cutest thing
mhm
and Lindsay was complaining about it and it was Caseys kind of standing by and she was saying something about oh hes so
stupid and you know and make Casey real mad and he just told her that that wasnt very nice to say about his friend and blah blah you know so you know so the
mhm
you guys get down here come on
the neighbor lady doesnt like them by her
yard shell come out and yell at them with her broom
oh oh brother
so oh oh did I talk to you since I was in the hospital
no
yeah I was in the hospital
why
oh I was bleeding I
oh
had blood in my stools and so I got real sick and
I guess I have colitis
and stuff so
babysitting probably isnt the best thing although they say it it isnt
stress caused its a genetic disorder or whatever but
it doesnt help it either it causes it to flare up so
yeah will they tell you to watch your diet are you on any
no he said to do nothing I mean they basically said if
if I know something bothers me then avoid it but theres really nothing they can do as far as
preventative medicine for it and the medicines they use to treat it
are not something they want you to stay on permanently because theres a lot of bad side effects
I guess cancer mainly I dont know he didnt go into all that but
anyway so when I get sick and I guess start bleeding and that then Ill have to go in and
and theyll put me on medicine which they use steroids so until I get better and then take me back off
oh because both my mom and my sister have colitis
mhm
and they told my sister off and on that they had come up with quite a few new medicines
that could really ease her because she has you know it flares up quite a bit
then they said there were quite a few things out there that could you know ease her discomfort you know
mhm
mean it doesnt get rid of it obviously but at least itll make her feel a little better
yeah
but but I dont know whats
I was thinking I was going to go to the health food store and see what they say as far as some things to take
theres so many different kinds of colitis he he didnt really call it colitis because he said everybody you know colitis is
a broad range of things and theres irritable bowel disease
right
and theres inflammatory
right
which inflammatory is what I have and thats a genetic disorder where irritable is just its more stress related
type and not quite as serious because theres two different kinds of colitis I guess he said and one
is a ulcerative colitis and one is crones colitis
right
and he told me within five years I would probably have crones disease
well thats what
which is better than the other because the other turns into cancer
they they told don that he has crones well doctors have at you know for other things and they said then he talked about his other problems and they said well
you know that sounds like youve got crones but without further testing I cant give you you know a definite diagnosis but thats what it sounds like to me well he wont ever go thats
thank you babe he wont ever go to have another test done
well well I had to have surgery they put that scope
you know because theyre not the most yeah
Ive been there but they put you out so
I guess oh well he doesnt even want to do any of the you know like with the
either an enema or the you know where you have to drink it he wont even do that
yeah
mhm
and I made a doctors appointment for him well before school was out it was like end of may
mhm
and don cancelled it because he thought because it was like at two oclock or something and he he was worried that
he wasnt going to get out in time you know and we had to pick up case and he said you know weve got a week left of school or whatever it was
and Ill just wait and do it after school is out which would have been fine but never made another appointment
yeah
in one of my we have two kids who are from the south both from Virginia
uhhuh
so Im talking about introducing like the periods of american history and I say the civil war
and they immediately raise their hand and they go we would like it to be called the war between the states
I said what they go we dont call it the civil war
they go we either call it the war of northern aggression or the war between the states
the war of northern aggression
I go you didnt just say that did you and they go yeah and they go we just wanted to see what your response was but
they call it the war between the states
the war of northern aggression
how do you like that one
so I didnt want to start a war the first day
so I I left it as is but I said well well come back to that
so I said if my history serves me correctly you guys fired the first shot
so
I dont know its kind of funny
it seem this is one of the girls in this class was the assistant secretary Tates daughter

yeah shes shes hilarious shes just shes
shes funny yeah she was telling me about how to hang with Katie and oh she loved my card she said she she read the whole thing to and stuff

We went to like the Schwartz club with my
with my group
We went there for the weekend and it frigging like rained all weekend long
We got there we were le like let off on top of this fucking mountain like
and we had to walk like probably like five kilometers
like to to the place where we were sleeping and it was
raining and it was like thirty mile an hour wind and it was so nasty and we had to like walk through all that
mhm
and we went to this like museum up there and the guy had like
such a heavy dialect
It was so funny
He was talking to this little
kid I heard him talking and hes like hi Stacey
Im like hi Stacey Im like hi Sta Im like is wa what what the hells tha
Because they all say like S H instead of sh instead of C H so

Thats what I figured
yeah
So but my most exciting thing is that a publisher is interested in my personal ad book
Wow
yeah so
Thats so cool
thankyou so I was all excited
And I got this letter and I was like I didnt know if it was a scam or something
yeah
Well Im always getting letters from vanity presses and shit
yeah
You know what I mean
Where you pay them to
the you pay them yeah
yeah so I looked them up in Writers Market and they did do thirty percent of their publishing vanity market so I was like okay
So I called them up the next day and its no they want to really publish it
Wow
So but I mean the thing is I they want the completed manuscript in a month
I have
holy shit
fuck the idea of how Im going to do it and that doesnt even
I mean that totally doesnt guarantee that theyre going to publish it
That just means theyre more interested and theyd like to see the whole thing
yeah
So but so I asked you on my email
I sent a message like asking people to look for funny personal ads and I want you to send it to like everybody you know
okay
okay

Thats so cool
Im so excited for you
I hope I get something because I mean thats money and thats all I want
yeah
so but seriously like email this to everybody you know

like thats only open from like eight oclock in the morning until
like twelve and since were in class from nine until twelve thirty you know I have to go like really early in the morning
Thats so funny
I know isnt
Well

they cant do anything in like one fucking day you know
Sounds like Russia

ohgod that sucks
yeah thats whats I mean its so funny because people talk about like I mean I guess the university and all the professors and everything I mean theres like
two two over two million almost three million books in the
in the library and stuff like that and of course like the professors are really good and the classes are really good but like
theres so like ass backwards like as far as the computers

ah it just really its really funny
uhhuh ha ha
hm
All you hear were we have lots of computers and everything is done in the American way
I know
I know
I was typing today and my
the Y and the Z are like
changed around and then there are some like other special characters and then
like the apostrophe you have to push shift to get it
and theres like a number sign in the normal place so like
half the things I sent out today probably had like
like number signs instead of apostrophes
mhm
Weird
yeah
hm hm well oh look at that cute little boy walking down the street
oh your hair is so obviously dyed my child
And it rains every frigging day
Its been re unlike
so glad that I dont have pneumonia

I have to read sixty pages of Russian today
It took me like five hours to do like five pages so I just sort of quit
mhm
And I mean and shes like she wanted me to spend the whole day with her today
and I felt really bad but I was like Im sorry but I simply cannot do that
Its just not an option you know
yeah

And shes like well maybe we can meet in the afternoon
I was like yeah Ill see how long it takes me to get this stuff done
So she calls me at nine thirty in the morning to see if I want to go out

so now e I like keep pushing back the time you know like well maybe you can come over at eight well maybe we can do something on Friday and its like
Im not going to have the time at all until she leaves you know
Well
it feels like a real pain in the ass
That sucks
I know I I just have so much work to do and it just
It s just not an option to not do this work because
Its just me and this other kid in the class
yeah its not like hes not going to call on you
with a scary professor
yeah so its not like I can just sit there and pretend to have read all of this stuff
yeah
So and he I dont know he just gives a ton of reading
Probably not remembering that hes expecting us to do an extensive research paper as well
Reall
and Ive already go Im already up to my eyeballs in work and Joanna Nichols is
insisting that I take this independent
study with her but she doesnt want to teach it
I dont want to take it
We dont know what were doing
She doesnt want to meet me
Its like
Hell
And I still
I know so shes like well come up with a bibliography of dialectology
stuff you want to read an and see me on Tuesday and Im like you obviously dont want to do this
I dont want to do it
so oh she was on N P R last week by the way
Reall
thats cool she taught
After she was on Talk Nation
What was she talking abou
She was talking about the origins of language but the thing is I didnt hear it because Eric heard it in the car and he called me at work and left a message but Darren was on the line
uh
So then Eric got there and we turned it on
I only heard the last few minutes
I heard her laugh though
Wow
Whatd she d
Sit on a whoopie cushio
I dont know but I mean like millions of people heard her laugh
It was pretty wild
so anyway Im very Im just so stressed out right now that I feel like crying and its like
the last thing I need is somebody going to me lets go out lets go out lets go out
Its like I cant okay
But I feel bad because shes only going to be here for another week

this weekend because I have all like I have
party and I have Diana and I had to finish up that book review for Language Magazine

I didnt even read the book
Wow
Well I hope nobody listening to this is from Language Magazine
but I
indeed do a book notice and just all these things that after this weekend like half of them will go away
yeah
You kno
yeah
So I dont know I jus I just I hope I go to Holland
Wouldnt that be coo
That would be so cool because like even this weekend I was just thinking because were all like deciding were like oh where do we want to go this weekend because theres like
a cool offer with

Thirty marks total
five like up to five people

um probably like twenty bucks
uhhuh
So you can go for like twenty bucks I mean but
but like really like four bucks each like
Anywhere within Germany you
uhhuh
go for the weekend so were going and
then like of you want to go outside the border then you can like pay up to the border and then you pay an additional little fee
Right
And
so were going to like Switzerland this weekend but when we were all just like
deciding where we wanted to go the weekend Im like wow I wish Linda and Eric we here
I could just
pop up to Holland and see them
ah
yeah
Well
Im trying to get things done but Carl you know I talked to Carl
Hes really busy
yeah
and like the board of directors is very unhappy because it
our American business is not doing very well so its probably like a really bad time for you to be irritating Carl about this
yeah
being the C E O and all
yeah
but I called him up and he was like well
I can let you kn you know or we Im definitely
outgoing like we could definitely go
But did I tell you thi
He said they might be moving
oh no
So that means that they wouldnt have company housing
Where would they be movin
because theyre above a furniture store right now like doing manufacturing so
ah
okay
He said but you know wed find a place for you because he knows it its
totally impossible to find a place in Utrecht
yeah
Its like well find a place for you and we can ta all I wanted to know
All I need to know is how much are you going to pay me and what are you going to give me in this packag
yeah yeah
Theyre very dusty honey
I couldnt believe how many sweaters you have like
ohmygod
y you could open a secondhand shop for like thirty sweaters its
ohmygod
yeah we have alotof very crappy sweaters
I mean alotof it looked like
yeah
yeah
I was thinking to my well I wouldnt keep this
I know I know
thankyou so much I cant believe that youre doing all that
But
So and then she washed like all the dishes that were on the shelves like so when you come back at least you know you have some
ohmygod
Clean dishes and something you can wear and
oh I feel so bad you know its like I fee I I
I I dont feel so bad about you because I dont feel like youre so traumatized
but I feel so bad about Tamara because I feel like she was sort of truly traumatized you know
by the whole thing and I dont
yeah but its o its okay I mean
I mean
yeah yeah shes really sweet
I mean after she went in and and ha eh saw the fleas she never went back in there she always sent me in
she sent you in
have you been have you been watering the plants by the way like along the way
because I know that she never went in
anymore
I I watered them like once
before I bombed the f the first time
yeah okay good great
and n now again but they they they look okay
yeah okay
okay great I kind o because I was thinking like um at the point where that happened
I was wondering if like Tamara
like got so shocked by the whole thing that she just like didnt
you know think to tell you that she hasnt she hadnt been watering the plants because I knew that she wasnt going in there you know
yeah
and stuff so yeah
No but now its
really theyre definitely gone now
oh boy
I mean Tamara is still like you know but you know there still can be a a mutation
Youre a big spoil
you know there are mutations you know and
who was saying that oh
Tamara
Poor poor girl
shes totally
yeah well as soon as Lilly
but Tamara come on I mean
yeah but as soon as Lilly is back in the apartment theyll go on her and if we keep
um you tol did you tell me about the stuff that you rub into them and they the fleas die
yeah but you dont you dont need that you dont have to put that you dont have to give that to Lilly anymore if the fleas are gone
yeah the fleas are gone
I dont think its so good for her you know
yeah i
because it really goes into the the blood you know
yeah yeah
But if you let her out again I mean I have
yeah then it can happen again
but you know you can put a flea
collar
collar around her you know
right right Im going to do that
Im sure you know
I actually have one here still I I felt
Weve never weve never had a flea in that apartment which is you know it must have started with one
little fucking flea you know
uh its really bizarre the whole story how it got in there
you know the thing its like the thing like I was horrified when Kristen told me and I was even getting mad and I was like saying like didnt you ever clean the place
you know and apparently it doesnt have anything to do with that
No
like if the place is clean or not you know
No
and my sister Lisa said that her house has been infested um several times with fleas while they were living in it just because of the dog you know
and the dog was always running around outside and and you know the place gets completely
um infested and she had to bomb while they were living there and what they did was they
bombed everything but the kitchen you know
mhm
and then like they put down a plastic thing over the dining room table and things like that but you b and you know its like and you just lived in the in the poison afterwards and she said well yeah you know
thats thats
yeah well I mean all you can do is like just wash everything make a do a Spring clean when you get that
yeah yeah
yeah
Well when I get back you know I mean if Tamara washed the plates thats very nice but Im going to take them all out and then Im going to wash down that
you know that thing and Im supposed to be speaking native English
Well she did that
she did that
the kitchen shelf the white one though she didnt she didnt get everything out of the cupboard and
and I mean you still have to do that
yeah the white
no she I dont think you have to I dont think you have to do that really I mean we dont use those
You know we noticed afterwards that the door was a little bit open you know one of the doors so
yeah so thats thats okay but I think the only thing thats in there are glasses well wa we wash the glasses
yeah yeah
but thats so sweet of her I cant believe she did that ohgod I feel so I feel horrible
No its okay
yeah thankyou so much
thankyou so much

You know its its
You owe us a nice dinner
Yes I know definitely
a real feast
A total feast yeah
oh Christians really looking forward to coming back
Hes hes getting like
mhm
getting a little bit tired of being here because like its so hard
to break into the scene like theres so many musicians here that even if you go to like a session and you play really good and people see that youre
playing good and turn their heads and stuff like that nobody comes up to him and asks him who he is
yeah
because they they dont want to know anybody new you know its its like they dont want any more competition and hes like
yeah
You know he was going to alotof sessions for a while
in Harlem and stuff like that and then he kind of just got fed up and stopped and hes been practicing at home
mm
but hes about ready to come back you know And I could stay here longer definitely
Yes yes I love being here I love being here
yeah
You know I do really good just being here its a you know I think I do want to spend a longer period of time in New York again
mhm
You know it jus its its its you know its just totally natural probably because I have my own place but
you know alotof good things are are happening
Like the show is coming up
Im in the middle of framing these photographs for the show and
shows coming up and Ive got my book into a couple of different collections and things like that
mhm
and just you know seeing people that I havent
seen in a long time and you know getting to know a couple of people a little bit better like I got to know
Karen remember k Lauras friend Karen Rosenfla
yeah yeah
yeah I got to know her like a I mean we went to school together and everything like that but I didnt really know her very well
I got to know her a bit better
I got to know my sister inlaw
Artys wife better and you know its been kind of its been kind of nice just being back you kno
mhm

around these panels you know of the pedestals and theyre pairing me together with another like conceptual minimalist
um Gunda Fursta who did like a red projection like just a like a slide projection of a red color onto a wall as like a last
you know work that she did
I think it th this one gallery and what she wants to do is is um
have like wall to wall red carpet put into that room of the of the
of the space you know which would go together with the objects and the pedestals really really well
mhm
So if she if she does that I mean unless its an ugly red
You know but
its probably just going to be a very deep kind of red you know
I think its going to kind of look funny
where is that going to b
in the

They used to be on Furssdom and they moved to Brunemstrascher
Budem righ
Brunemstra

like ah invites about twelve students over at a time you know and hed and
ha invites them over for dinner at his house
theres a couple other people that are really good friends tha um that always deal with the chi the kids from the center that are pretty well known
and so like Omar he he just sells olivewood carvings that are absolutely beautiful
and theres a couple other people that
thats its not as ki its kind of fun to interact with them and
and anyway its its fun really fun
huh
Its different being down here though its theres you know a lot differences the food is really good though the bread is wonderful
like everywhere you go theres pita bread and the other kind of bread that you like dipped in herbs and spices and stuff and
it is really good the bread down here is good and theres lots of fruit theres like pomegranate trees everywhere I didnt realize that pomegranates were grown down here
huh
We even have one outside of our outside of our room on our balcony
Do they have fresh prom pomegranates on it right no
It does you can eat em theyre good
oh wow really fun
Theres olive trees all over like okay let me describe my room
its you go outside the coolest thing is is that like
the whole center is built on a hill and so instead of I mean its eight floors but it doesnt like
its not like high rise eight floors it just kind of cascades down the mountain you know what Im sayin
yeah you sent me that picture so
oh yeah so you kind of see it saw it
which one did I send you
is it just of the cente
yeah just like an aerial aerial view
oh yeah okay so you know what Im talking about
yeah
Anyway and so then
like our room is on the floor fourth floor
mhm
and you actually go outside to get to our room theres a hallway thats outside
and then the rooms are just I mean they look like little apartments you know that you get into
and theres the hallway is just all done in marble
and you know theres trees in the hallway and
and theres ivy that grows on the wall and you come into the room
uhhuh
and
and you know its got our beds and the bathroom and stuff and then
and then theres a patio where you go outside and theres a wooden trellis that kind of bows overhead and kind of makes a little roof for it for us I guess and its got all of these flowering plants on it and ivy and
and then we have this big rose garden in front of us and and then you just have this perfect view of the city
So youre actually above the city what
yeah right were above the city were on mount Scopeth which is right next to the mount Olif
and so
um Jerusalem is right below us
it takes about fifteen minutes to walk
Is
into the old city
Is the Jerusalem center on the highest mountain for around ther
um its yeah well pretty close
like Hebrew University is just above us
Whats it calle
Hebrew University
is just right above us
we go there alot we have access to all of their stuff
um their library and
everything like that but
And who whos that done b
who a University
um I think it is just a state university
you know
From Jerusalem hu
yeah
ah well no I mean the state of Israel
yeah
ca
I think thats who runs it but
um
theres alotof people worldwide that are there
huh
Im sorry Im like trying to wake up
Well I thought I guess I was an hour off I thought itd be just about seven oclock and youd be wide awake by now but
You are now
I am now
we we have tomorrow off too
oh do you
whats nice is we have like
four days of classes
and
and then we have
um
three days off
its weird though because its Sunday over there now hu
yeah it is
Sunday night
see we have our Sunday on Saturday our Sabbath on Saturday
and so it its so easy to get confused with days Im just I forget what day it is because it just it just messes me up
because Sundays you know we go out and go on field trips and everything like that and anyways its confusing
But oh Im taking my Isaiah class so wonderful its so good
At what ti
I love it
What time do you normally start classes
um at about seven forty
At seven forty
yeah we have we have our Old Testament class in the morning every morning at seven forty
And then I usually have usually have Im that class is a lot actually we study alot down here
Surprisingly enough but I have my Old Testament class and then I go to do either
um N E S Near Eastern Civilizations its really good Brother Skinner teaches it and he
What is it N N E S
uhhuh Near Eastern Near Eastern
Studies
What does that stand for I said Near Eastern Civilizations thats not right
No thats a C so
what is it
Studies Near Eastern Studies
Near Eastern Studies thats what it is
okay youll have to give me a break because Im a little tired
Anyway thats a really cool class because they you get to learn all the history behind everything
And it starts making things in the Bible make sense you know
oh yeah
you know you find out oh okay I understand you know okay when this happened when Abraham was journeying and
What was going on politically in the area what was going on culturally in the area and all of a sudden the stories kind of make sense
And it just they just come to life you know its really neat I like it alot and then I have
then I have my Jewish Culture class taught by rabbi Rosen
hes really really good really good teacher and ah tha thats been interesting to to learn about yeah
Does he speak English pretty well
yeah actually hes British and he speaks with this really cool British accent I love listening to him talk he uses all of these
um cool words and in his British accident accent it just it just kind of sounds kind of neat
hes an hes a neat figure hes really energetic and anyway um he ah
and then theres this Arab Civilization class that I take from um from Brother hes an Arab here
a very prominent Arab Muslim down here he really was influential in getting the center built here
he worked with President Hunter alot that knew him very well he is so neat and I wrote I wrote this in my letter so youll get it twice but
um he was talking to us one time in one of our classes and he was saying somebody asked him hes known as a dry Mormon
down here and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant and and he said
he just started he kind of laughed and he started going on about how he first came in contact with the church and President Hunter and
and he said and he just started getting all he got all choked up you know and started to cry
and ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself but he said he said that
he said that he always felt like in Islam they believe that Mohammed was a prophet
hm
And they believe in all the other prophets that the Old Testament and the New Testament you know that Jesus was a prophet
anyway but they believe that Mohammed was the last prophet you know and so he was the seal of the prophet
they dont worship em him or anything they just believe that he was a prophet and and
anyway he said it always didnt seem right to me that God would not send any more prophets down to the earth that Mohammed would be the last one
that he wouldnt give his people guidance you know that that would be it you know because hes seen alot in his religion
answers that they dont have and problems that you know people kind of go astray in these different ways because they dont know
you know and its funny because I learn about the Jewish religion and its the same thing you see all of these divisions happening and all of these questions and you ask
you know theres the old joke if you ask ah three Jewish men a question youll get four opinions
You know tha I mean theyre just
theyre very you know you you really do Ive talked to several of them you really get different things
because you know theres the ultra orthodox and the reformed and the anyway
and so he was just saying that ah he never thought that that was right and he said when I
whenever I am with your prophet President Hunter I he says I cannot explain it its just a feeling inside
and then hed say do you know what I mean
and we were all just silent you know and
and just nodding our heads and he says
yup
he says I just cannot help but feel that that this is a man of God
the car is running fine yeah
good oh good
okay phew
its always always an adventure with you
what
sorry
no thats okay like I said in my letter
its a roller coaster
so how are you doing
Im good its cold today today is like the first day
its cold today here too
but its been really chilly they were calling for it all week so I was prepared for it you know I knew it was coming it didnt get me down
and I went out and did my walk this morning which felt great and Ive had a sweatshirt on
good
and then I came back here and
I
finished working out while I watched cartoons which I havent done in a long time and
right
and then I just cleaned I cleaned and cleaned
like I did this last sunday too lots of cleaning
right
first I swept the floors then I scrubbed the bathroom floor with
the tile cleaner in water and then I scrubbed
the whole floor out here with the Murphys oil
right
in water
so hopefully thatll cut down on the dust and I just cleaned so much my knees hurt
if you lean down on them they really do
and it took
well we have to give you something else to do while youre down there

its just I find
just keep just keep doing your work keep focusing on I notice that I I dont think about
right
the fact that youre not here because I am always so busy you know and
Im hoping that I I thought a lot about
some ideas for what I want to do
uhhuh
you when you read me email youll youll see I wrote you a long letter
okay
Im hoping that excuse me Im sorry
its okay
Im hoping that tonight
or now when I go to asleep that I can
dream about what Ive been thinking about
yeah
uhhuh
and I want to get up and I was going I have a paper due soon so I want to get busy on that and
mhm
I mean I just try to just focus on on
yeah
it gets hard sometimes but
you know I havent had any anyone approach me or whatever
I nothing I mean
mhm
theres been one incident
but it wasnt even an incident it was one girl
who I think is a metals major
kind of stared at me once and then I saw her again and she was staring at me again and kind of smiling at me
mhm mhm
so I approached her
I approached her one day outside on campus when I saw her again
uhhuh
with her friend
and and this is the reason why because I was walking by and I saw her with her friend
well Im taking a class
in
physical anthropology
I applied heres the whole story
this is first let me give you the whole rundown of why I didnt call you earlier
in case your
family didnt tell me
I I didnt have your phone number
oh so thats silly
yeah
how did you get it
well I called your family
oh
and then
they have it
and then they had it
yeah
and then
mhm
Bens
father and sister came for a few days
mhm
and
so I couldnt really stay up late and call and I couldnt
get up early and call
mhm mhm
and there wasnt
you have to entertain and
you know Rachel is like being on the couch downstairs and
so
and then and then I couldnt find your number
and then this whole thing with the classes happened and let me and then I couldnt get up in the morning because I knew that you were on
doing classes and stuff and like you would get up and go to work in the morning so I couldnt call you
at night I would have to get up early and call you and I just couldnt get up
and then that whole thing in the class like I applied for the graduate level
uhhuh
right and I went and I talked to them and I said you know like what
what are you looking for and they said basically what were looking for is that you dont embarrass us
you know
you dont embarrass us
right so I was like
what the hell who were you talking to who were you talking to
okay
to the its like the college of general studies
uhhuh
its like sort of the night school and they have this program where you can take four
graduate courses
uhhuh
and pay like the reduced price in my case I dont pay anything because
mhm
of the benefits
and and then if you enroll in the program its there
so you know and its like
it can it serves for graduate school as like a stepping stone to get into the program
uhhuh
like you know that you dont have its not
as rigorous an application process and all that
mhm
stuff
mhm mhm
right so
you dont embarrass us and then they were like whats your grade point average and I told them they were like well that sounds
about like what were looking for dadadada
you dont embarrass us
I know
kiss my butt
so then
I get this letter were sorry you have not been accepted to the graduate level
oh no why
you have been accepted for the undergraduate and Im like I was devastated
oh no
I was devastated
Im sorry honey
yeah well it then I went in I was like I went in to work and Im like
at work
and one of my coworkers was like look
if what what probably happened is they didnt like the classes that you had
and they wanted you to have particular classes that they deemed appropriate
bingo its all like
great
cultural anthropology that Ive had
uhhuh
no physical anthropology no archaeology
uhhuh
and I went and I went in and I talked to them and they were like you you know they said that thats what it was I was like
meanwhile I had like
spent the night crying
going Im not good enough they dont like me
it was horrible I was like fuck that
oh
ugh
I felt terrible
yeah you should
never believe that you are such a good student
I mean even at Earlham you were a good student
you got
I know
good stuff going for you you know
well its just like this like after being out of it for a year
and
its not something you lose
oh I feel like I have
I mean your brain
feel like Im getting
I feel like Im getting stupid
may have to like take it out and polish it once in a while to keep it up to date
yeah yeah
but
yeah
still there
so but I I mean like it I mean it really hurt
oh honey Im sorry
it really hurt
but Im fine now because I know that theyre just its just because theyre snobs
well thats what you get living in Philadelphia girl
it doesnt have to do with Philadelphia it has to do with the university of Pennsylvania being an ivy league school
exactly
exactly thats what you get for living in Philadelphia
being around ivy league schools man
there are a couple of different places I could live where that would you know I could be at
temple which is not an ivy league school
thats true
but
so
you live in Philadelphia so youre going to go to university of Penn
mhm so
but thats thats my major story
thats the story so now youre in this physical anthropology class
yeah which is I was kind of like okay its going to be really scientific and
the kind that if its irregular all the time
mm
um evidently it causes it the possibility of causing a clot is very high
hm
and so
um they I dont quite understand if theyre going to do this or not
but sometimes they administer a small shock to try and get it sort of back on track
mhm
um so it gets back to a normal beat
but otherwise you just try with drugs or something
Well no what they do is they
give him drugs for an anticoagulant
so that whatever clot was in there and caused that hopefully gets dissolved
mhm
but then they you know they have to monitor that very closely because for example
a week and a half ago they said okay you cant shave until we see you again
well
in other words youll bleed to death if you
oh yeah right
it
See its a very dangerous whats actually whats more dangerous is that some sort of internal bleeding begins and
you dont know about until youre dead so
mhm
yeah hm
but they they cut him down to one checkup a week instead of two which is
mhm
uh very promising
yes
and you know how it goes those little things Im sure you recall
are very meaningful
yeah yeah absolutely I was at I was at a meeting yesterday and
that was the the something to do with the hospital and so we went had fru we had lunch at the hospital
mhm
thats really weird going in to the hospital
oh
that mustve been very weird
yes but
have you been to that hospita
since
uh no no
um but Ive been I you know Ive been looking at it for a while already so it was okay
uhhuh
and I was looking
eh the I was there for two days for a meeting and the day before I had already
looked up because I know the the walkway between the two parts of the building
where I would walk you know things like that
uhhuh
So so that was okay
and we had coffee down in the normal coffee place
uhhuh
and so and the people there who had visited me were there and so we joked about things and it was fun
uhhuh
so was it
what was the meeting there fo
eh it was about projects
oh at the hospital
yes
yeah theres a theres a group of people who do work
in computer stuff in languages eh
awful at the hospital
oh oh I see
so anyway youve been horribly busy
youre a victim
yes horribly horribly horribly
Im sorry
oh
but now its now its over with now its okay
good
good
so now I can uh well
eh start to feel normal again
uhhuh how long do you get to feel normal again
eh I Im not sure but anyway for the time being Im normal so its okay
uhhuh uhhuh
youd say its going through eh getting back to normal it seems like going through your email
uhhuh
and you know electronic mail
and cleaning out the last two hundred messages that you had ignored
ohmygod
because you didnt have time to eh eh look at them
ohmygod that sounds like a nightmare
yes
I come home to three messages on my answering machine and I
yes
practically shut the thing off or
exactly so this is
wish lightning would strike and just break it or something
mhm
or anything
so anyway so you had a nice time with Jesse
yeah I had a wonderful
I heard about that yeah
yeah I had a wonderful time with Jesse that was really great except
she probably told you dont go to Santa Barbara on during fiesta
not the time to go to Santa Barbara
uhhuh
There are twenty million people there I mean not no kidding
oh
but it was really fun anyway
but we got sort of burned out going downtown
because we
Yes its
the the fourth of July theres not that many people
not compared
youre not youre not overwhelmed by people li
yeah nothing like fiesta I mean it was nothing and thats probably
you know we dont have much to compare well you have more because youve been there more but
thats probably more than its usually there and fiesta was just
mhm
that means I think
half of Los Angeles went to Santa Barbara for fiesta
but it was fun anyway well it was I didnt care where I was with Jesse if I just
yeah
sit in the car in traffic jam and talk to her I dont really care but
but but what is fiesta anyway
um
Well its
I dont know its a general term I mean they have that in New Mexico too its
just its a Hispanic celebration I dont what it
If if it even ack you know acknowledges some particular date or anything I
I think its just a yearly you know festival its like
yes
mhm
like carnival or something you know just a time
everybody gets dressed up and
theyre li you know hundreds of incredibly cute little kids all wearing their
yeah
you know purple and silver outfits and
You really did yeah right
makeup and they look so proud of themselves and they were really really cute
but its just you know lots of parades lots and lots of parades I mean
parades seem to be the the main thing to do and then
you know stands where you can get all kinds of you know tacos and this kind of thing and
Ban sorry bands singing and stuff like that so
I dont really know what it is beyond that
but it was really fun anyways
but but Snow you didnt know that was any eh special historical eh
not that I know of no I mean in New Mexico its the s same they just have something called fiesta and it just everybody
has a big party and
well
I dont I dont know if they have anything connected to it or not but anyway that was lots of fun
yeah so hows and and then oh yeah but then theyve been there since in the meantime too at your place
yeah thats right
so was that before that was after
yeah that was when when the when the Joshs father had to
right they
thats right thats right they were here
just eh keep track of the
sometimes because I wanted to congratulate you on the cowboy boots I heard that that would
oh yeah boy are they cute theyre that was so sweet of them you know the
Jesse had seen those six more than six months before that and remembered which was amazing to me and I kept refusing to try them on because I thought
mhm
you know why should I try them on theyre two hundred dollars Im not going to buy them but anyway she remembered so that was really really sweet
and anyway I have them that was it was a fun visit unfortunately
that all happened with Joshs dad right when we were going to go somewhere but
um we had a fun time anyway
and some friends of mine were looking around Portal you know where Jesse did Jesse tell you where they went and stayed
Well I dont remember that she said the name or anything just that it was somewhere
y
yeah its this place thats very special to them that they
um told us about and we went and visited it before we even came here
mhm
mhm
and its just this little
beautiful canyon that looks like paradise the minute you walk into it and
they have little cabins for rent there and when Josh and I first visited before we even moved here
we both just went oh lets just
buy one of those cabins and forget about it
right just hang around the cabin yeah
forget about having a cafe
We could have a cafe where
one person a day comes and has a cup of coffee and
yes
anyway its really really pretty and
evidently Michael had
actually Jesse went with him years and years ago
when he was at U C L A theres a research station up in this canyon and and
oh yeah because she had said to me that they didnt stay there they wanted to to have something a bit more
you know different yeah
right anyway so thats how that spot
came into the picture and they finally went there and stayed there and had a wonderful time
mm
and some friends of mine who live here were looking at
property for sale all over the place and that was one the places they were looking in that particular area
So I got them to give me their real estate map of where it was and sent it to Jesse and Michael I hope
hoping to and I put a little arrow that said you are here hoping to egg them on so
mhm
Well at high time th they buy something similar so
yeah well I you know I figure I mean its none of my business and you know its hard to say what
what people you know I asked I asked Jesse point blank you know can you
Are you in the position to buy something right now with you know the land here relatively speaking is really cheap I mean like five hundred dollars an acre you know
mhm
yeah
yeah
and she said yeah so I thought shit you know whatever happens
maybe they should just buy some land and you know if whatever they can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit because they dont like bed and breakfasts and
yeah
you know its sometimes its good when you have the money to get the things you want because
yeah well theyve been talking about getting getting places for a long time and they just never get around to getting any place
later on you know
yeah I know well I think I mean Im just imagining you know what their position is because its Im sure its its very hard when youre doing something and you
yeah
cant get out of it you know to do any anything
No they wont but they but they can at least have some vacation time or something
right or you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you buy some land y its yours
mhm
you know I mean and the taxes on it are nothing I mean even if
yeah
and you can always sell it in in the worst cast you know
yeah but now is the time because
real estate is really going up around here now
um southeastern Arizona has gotten alotof attention and
uhhuh
I think theres lots of urban refugee type stuff happening where people are
unhappy more and more with the city and they dont know what to do or how to leave or how to make a living but alotof people just come here and go fuck it Ill figure something out you know
So its kindof a strange thing to be happening
um
Yes
you know very sort of anti what we were all brought up to to do
mhm
y you know
kind of backwards of the American dream where you get your career and your little house and everything and
anyway so Ive been trying to tempt them So I told them that we would go and look at this property if they wanted
but anyway
yeah but the they also fixed the the Christmas vacation theyre still
a couple of weeks I guess and then hes going to try to you know find a job and stuff like this
okay
so but hes hes al hes been hooked up with
yeah
different programs but
uh
um Im trying to think what else is going on what else is news
Chris and Michelle mom and dad
Whats Nathan doin
Did you hear about tha
No
uh lets see how do I put this he was
um
uh he actually was was was caught stealing

yeah and theres could be certain charges pressed but
um

uh
So its pretty much just settled but he was
at the lumber yard
yeah
they had they had
a a a detective who
ah

Well at next to last

one of those things yeah but
So that that has to go via the court so
yeah well like each kid has to go through theirs I guess huh
yeah
theres always something new
yeah
So yeah that was interesting but
mm mm
So yeah

I mean that yeah I guess would be the kind of like the the the major news then
yeah

oh they think its neat
yeah
yeah
yeah well Sara should be gone but she mi hopefully shes going to go back
there this summer so
oh good the Summer this Summer I should be coming home
yeah well wh would you know what do have you have any tentative uh
No I have no i it will probably I have no idea probably July August
oh yeah yeah shell be back by she go in the in the Spring
uhhuh
So yeah ooh yeah thats fun thatll be well see I this is for both of us its our last year of residence
yeah
And then once we you know we still have to do well have to write our dissertation but
We wont have to be going to school and stuff like this but
oh thats thatll be nice thats thirty years of school huh
So
oh yeah really
so that aspect will be done and then so yeah
mhm
So Im trying to think what else is going o
Are you f are you following the popes visit in the United State
yeah
yeah
yeah that was a he was a i it turned out very good
Thats good I heard some lady died while he was saying mass or something
oh Im sure s theres alotof people Im sure th statistically theres a good chance of someone dying
yeah
yeah it actually was the the the coverage was pretty g or the
the sense was good because
oh
alot oh yeah and he has to yield his presence
uhhuh
You know how he has his presence and people are attracted to his presence and
yeah yeah
feel that that whole phenomenas still
yeah
um
Because the Italians made it sound that they he wasnt bein getting much attention
And the reporters werent ready and they werent they werent ge he wasnt giv getting
c good coverage in the United States
Well I know before h well that maybe
tr true
I mean to some extent I I havent like its like I have a
yeah
I dont watch T V so I dont know whats on T V but
the
the news
uhhuh
Well in the see before they had
various theologians who are critics of them
yeah
who were you know saying that you know hes just
hes not in touch and all this stuff
yeah
there there was that aspect but once he was here the amazing thing you know because
it it doesnt make any difference what the press says because
uhhuh
because once yeah he has those huge crowds
yeah yeah
And that and you know theres still like
Mi mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds
yeah yeah
And his ability to have like instant conversions I mean I
Ive known tons of people and theyre just there to have instant conversion
yeah thats good
So I mean it doe I mean granted he the process doesnt necessarily help
Right
but theres something about him where hes
he doesnt need the press
yeah yeah I mean it
yeah
I mean because hes able to get the
you know so that
yeah I mean in in j oh I guess its
you just become so its so much part of What you expect
there will be this qu like theyll bring up all these statisti like like
st st statistics how people
while even while they like the pope they disagree with what he says
uhhuh
d I mean theyll they always do so you kind of
oh yeah thats normal
just become accustomed to it
Right
But I know but just he its amazing how
you know i its i
you know people who
have that an incredible affect I mean I dont know
I dont know what it is but
So yeah that yeah that I Ive be I ha Ive been following pretty closely you know through the papers and stuff but
yeah so hes leaving about right now hell be leaving pretty soon
yeah because hes only staying five days
yeah he leaves today tonight
uh
So
yeah so did how was Julius stay back at in in at
I hav I really havent even seen her since she got back I I only one of the sisters came down to Sicily so they sent me the letter
yeah
uh I was just wondering how her family was doing
yeah I have no idea
so I have to go to Italy to find out
right
yeah because I I dont I havent like in fact Mark is trying to get hold of John
yeah yeah because I yeah I had written
because he wants to see about me Mark was thinking about going to some type of vocational school but
And John is in the school in in Saginaw or Lancing areas and
yeah
yeah
Saginaw I think but I dont know
yeah
So
Im trying to think of what else is what else is happening in the big world here
Yes its just basic ever wer were back to the grinding stone of papers and stuff like that so
yeah
yeah
I with one of the people I teach with
uh hes t hes doing like hes principally responsible for all the English translations for John Pauls work
uh I see thats nice
yeah
but and
so I it was its funny to hear theyre there but um
Im trying to think what else is I I just spur of the moment called I had no i I was like well theres something what time is it right now in Ital
okay its its twenty to nine
okay
We already changed our time did you guy
I dont I dont I hope I didnt
w we sent it back
I h I know thats coming up pretty soon I dont
uh yeah we do it before you guys do
okay so its nine thirty
No its twenty to nine eight thirty its eight thirty
oh good oh youre only like five hours behind right now or ahead if I four or five behind yeah
yeah yeah right right
So gosh so what whats you know I want to ask y g how is is this with is that
Is there anythin
Is that just more or less what it i
its pretty much a anything thats going to happen or not going to happen is pretty much done righ
ah I think so yeah
yeah
Hows the mail order
I think theyre doing pretty good because I dont have too much contact with them
Right right
And so I ha I really have no idea to tell you the truth
yeah
um see yeah because I I know that this Summer they did a vocational camp but I have no idea how it went
Right
Because Im being down in Sicily its you know were down
yeah oh yeah I know youre
I dont know mm mm
yeah Im surprised you guys have a house there wow
yeah we have two houses in Sicily
oh really
yeah were twenty minutes apart
right right
and so
and eh next year we should be going to Fatima
oh wow thatll be a big break for you guys then
yeah
yeah
fir the first of October
some of the sisters made like how many of them there was this
eight sisters that made their final vows
okay
And on the twenty ninth of October fourteen sisters make their first vows
How man
fourteen
good
and theyre the ones that went Diana was with them
Well that wouldve been the group of Di okay
She knows them yeah
okay
and then well have three that enter nov novitiate
okay good
I dont know how many well do the fast li
eh come and do the eh I dont know
yeah
well I was telling s I I seldom you g I dont know how you guys do things but
I if you guys ever get a ch like if theres any of the sisters in in Rome like
s the the midwest they should go to Stevenville
uhhuh yeah
I think that would be great because I you know like the I dont know if you the Dominican sisters in Nashville
uhhuh
I was very inf influential helping them get sisters in the Tuperville and also the
The Daughters of Saint Paul
yeah The Daughters of Saint Paul are good sisters
yeah
In Amer in America
I ha I have a very I have a very close ah
you know relat Ive helped him out in so many different ways I
yeah
getting their pro their religious ed programs started but
uh
parishes and then
help them with their vocations and
uh one of our sisters has a sister in that order
right
yeah
their I mean theyre I mean theyre they kind of been around they have been at the trench I mean
yeah
because they always of course the ones that I know the ones that I really know are from Cleveland and
uhhuh
they they said
that you know of course they they they still have some troubles like with the with the Italian sisters but
uhhuh yeah yeah
I dont know what they meant I mean I dont know what exactly they meant by that but
but I mean in general I mean they have like a moderate increase in vocation
uhhuh
something like that but
yeah thats I Ill but if you if you ever ge if you ever get a chance
w we have a sister that lives in in Illinois
What do you mean she lives ther
I mean her family is from Illinois
Good thankyou
to tell them that you had arrived safely
Good okay
and then shes got here that Sister Justa died in Berlin today
oh sorry to hear that
about
ten thirty P M their time in Europe

she said yes
yeah mhm

isnt that nic
Imagine
a a real bake
a real baked potato a
oh that was good
and you know they have nice bread oh the sisters are very very kind
oh thats good
and
today was my first day that I went over to the mass I didnt go to the mass yesterday because I slept but today I went to the
to the mass over in the um
in the compound where the priests are
oh
so I had my first experience of walking over there
Is it Englis
No Chinese
it was it was in Chinese
yes but uh
the the priest who picked me up at the airport Father Dominique
he he is a newly ordained priest
and he speaks some English and he wants me to teach him more
and he said he will come and say the mass once in a while in English and so that will be nice so
oh well thats nice the Father Dominique he said he speaks English
Father Dominique speaks some English he is newly ordained and he
oh some
oh what about that other priest that remember there was supposed to be another priest over there
Well the I havent met the Father Simon
oh
oh
he is in Rome right now hes supposed to he was he also studied in the United States but hes in Rome right now
oh I see
I want to tell you that when I got to Chicago
My sister Agnes was right there to meet me so that was very nice
oh thats nice
and then she waited until I got on the plane and then after I got on the plane
um
there was a mixup because
the people in Chica I didnt realize this until I got to San Francisco
that the people in Chicago they took the wrong ticket from me
oh
they took the ticket that says from SanFrancisco to Taipei and so when they
oh and then what happene
when they got to SanFrancisco
the lady said I could really be charged for a second ticket and I said oh no
oh
but she didnt she didnt charge me she she called Chicago and she recognized the mistake they made
well that caused great confusion for me because when I got on the plane in Chicago
I had the wrong seat number somebody else had that seat number thats because I was dealing with a different ticket
oh my goodness
so anyhow it all worked out but it was
well Im glad
a little confusion but while I was on after I got on the plane in Chicago
and they were they were still boarding it was very very crowded it was a seven forty seven
All of a sudden they called my name
to come to the to the front of the plane so I finally got through all the crowd and got there
oh
and they told me to got out to the desk and here my nephew Tommy
C K the one that has cancer
mhm yes
he came to see me and he he didnt get there on time and so my sister Agnes
she went up to the man and asked if if they could call me off the plane
oh my good
so I got off the you know I got on on time to see him so that was very nice yeah
yeah
yeah
well that was nice
and Sister Margaret Mary and Father Dominique and a teacher they met me at the
airport in Taipei
oh that was
and it was
it was their October the tenth is their Independence Day
so there were alotof fireworks and it was very
oh
oh thats like when the first sisters came
Just like the fourth of July thats right
It was extremely crowded in the at the airport
oh
oh
and then we had to drive for three hours
oh my
to Elan
and its true that it was a curvy drive
oh but Father Dominique drove it
and then we stopped at a
eh one of the parishioners house he he makes tea so we went into the store and that was an experience in itself to see how they they make the tea and then
oh I bet
yes
we just sat down and he boiled the tea right in front of us put down the put the kettle on right in the little store and boiled the tea
mhm
and gave us a little cup of tea and some cra cookies so that was nice and then we got to

Did you decide what kind of house y youre going to ge
Well you know what were kind of e not
did you say we were
going for the log cabin because you know they have maintenance

And so but they like the big old farm house
0
So that was exciting
What about Larry and Tim did th
are they still
Well the thing is we have to
uh see how it goes first w if were able to sell it
You know
And if not then then well d think of the other
Thats good

And and Larry has been coming deer hunting
oh really
He has a
He he has a blind back in the fields you know

once
Right
Thats right
You had walked back in the woods

then eight then nine and a half
its like over a twelve hour period
uhhuh

And then a four hour shift on Saturday
I see e hows the weather ther

It is getting warmer
yeah

uhhuh
Guess its warm
oh
Have you gone down by the ocea

yeah
oh but e Amy its been eighty degrees here
oh
ohmygosh
It is so pretty
I bet its nice
It it is
yeah but its supposed to get cold tomorrow
Or tonight its supposed to theres a cold front coming down from Canada
oh reall
Reall
So its going to be getting colder
So
And you know it thats kind of good
Weve really had a hot summer
yeah
I know
oh I
been hot
It was the hottest
oh do you know what Im been making sweatshirts and you
I I affuse
doily on there a heart doily
Are you going to send me on
And then I put the yoyos around e they are so pretty
You uh they re so I was making one for Corky
Her birthday was yesterday
mhm
So Im making one for her
oh
Right
Its you know she likes rose color
So I found a sweatshirt on sale for five dollars
oh cute
I f I found a but you wouldnt want a sweatshirt now would yo
Its cold air
oh you dont have to make it now
oh no but I bet in the evening its
Its cold yep
uhhuh
Like
Its cold during the day
I wore a t I wore a turtleneck and sweater today
oh really
Pair of jeans
yep
oh
its cold
uhhuh
oh my
Have you have you
e looked into nursing at the hospitals or anything ye
No huh
I cant mom
oh you cant yet
How many times do I have to explain it to you
I cant do it without my license
Id I mean I guess it just totally makes sense that they do because thats just not something I think of Iranians doing is making films
Gassing Kurds and shooting Iraqis yeah that makes sense that they do that
Well thats a different kind of Iranians I imagine
Which I think Nassirs more Persian but its the same area then it became Iran later
Meanwhile back at the ranch

Things never change
Yes they do
Regardless
So any whats happening with you and Sharo
Well we are here in Italy

On the weekends we try and get out and go places see the country
Getting a little more difficult as of late
Were kind of busy over here as Im sure you its all in the news but

Though well anyway were were busy
Let me put it that way

yeah something like that
Something like that
You does your email I mean are you getting the email

Thats okay
You can send it to me later

She one of her students showed her well its funny enough that she finally got email after Ive been telling her for years to do it
right
and now shes has this big push that everybody needs to get it
right
hello mom
thanks mom Thanks for the thanks for the tip
and one of her students showed her how to get into the X five hundred directories
which are
which h
what are the X five hundred directorie
oh where you put your how c how can you not kno
address sometimes a and then she ca can put you like favorite fa favorite beverage some other little information mm where did you travel
oh its like a your finger file kind of thin
mm no its different but sort of like that
okay
um and for my favorite beverage I put down of course almond tea with honey and milk
mhm
and so she read that because that was what was there and when she sent me a message
She wrote that and wrote big mamas watching
And ever since everything she signs from me is love big mama
whats she doing nowaday
Just out of curiosity
um shes teaching computer science at Wright State
okay
Computer Science
yeah I mean wa she was doing math and computer science but right now shes just doing computer science
Mostly applications
um not any real computer stuff the hard stuff the programming but
yeah
This is how you do M S Word this is how you do an Excel or a spreadsheet whatever
Important
yup
So whats it like living in a coop
good
Actually Im the president
Are you reall
What i now dont coops have like a particular theme or is it the
No this is just a living coop
okay
I live well
alotof the coops at Michigan alotof the coops in general are houses
This is more of an apartment style coop
mhm
Thats sort of a cross between a dorm and like a house
okay
I mean the room its very dorm like in terms of the room like you have a room but on the other hand
right
its well its mostly graduate students so
That feels different but no in that way I mean its really nice to come home and have dinner ready
right
Like a nice dinner every night cooked specially
Theres a chef who takes care of things during the week
oh thats all right
Theres and he plans meals and every people here put in three hour work shifts and prepare it but decides what its going to be
You know and shell come to clean the bathroom every week you know
Right
deal with the mundane things that I dont handle well
yeah
you know on a regular basis when I start feeling overloaded
although I havent it its its so much easier than undergrad for me
Im sorry It couldnt have been much more difficult
Im pretty much just taking it easy
thats cool
Studying a bit here
Going out and doing stuff
Watching Iranian films
Im not watching them Nassir is Im
oh youre not going to watch Iranian film
No
Im going to see my friend Molly and some other Earlham friends
ah
I
Well Im sort of disappointed
I wanted you to tell me what Iranian film was like but you can ask Nassir
Actually this week he told me its a movie about this woman who I think was a nurse
and actually did alotof work and did alotof good stuff but then when she got married
her mother inlaw is very traditional and so she stopped working because it was making her husband unhappy
right
and then there was some kind of disaster that had happened when a plague or something I think
and so she brought her skills back out into the open and cures people and does really good things and
so it it gets into some of the problems of traditional sie society and roles of women sort of pro feminist kind of stuff
Sounded neat to me
Its one I would watch
yeah cool
Last film I watched was Star Wars
Bought it on video tape
Twelve ninety five
Pretty cool
yeah
Well wh
Not exactly deep culture though
It is well its very cultural
I It is very pop cul yeah very pop culture
Pop culture
Well you know why they rereleased them for the last time righ
yeah because theyre coming out with the new ones
Well not only that
Theyre redoing parts of the old ones
I guess Id heard something about theyre going to do like computer graphics or something like that
I dont know
Theyre redoing parts of it I think to help fit in with the with the new one
And so that way they get two major sales of the three video tapes
Seems like a pretty good deal to me
Ill buy them
Ill help
Ill support that part of the economy
Support your culture
Your taxpayers dollars at work
Star Wars yeah all three of them twice
yeah I watched you know five days of them
I dont need to go out of the house

I had Lucky Charms for breakfast
Thats awesome

whew no time soon
Just though you might come home for Christmas or something
Nope not a chance
mm
We have we have whats called a I R F which is the Initial Reaction Force
Turns out that the battalion Im in is the only American
airborne in fact the only light forces i
e
we dont have big
tanks and shit
in Europe
And so if anything really really bad happens they will deploy us first because were easy to move
yeah Id deploy you
Youre easy
and
Ive always said that
I know it
but
So we rotate responsibility in the battalion on whos on a basically a four hour alert
Need to be there with all your gear in four hours
and during Christmas Ill be on it
So I aint going nowhere
ah
oh well
You know one of these day

Yes I should in fact
When I have money again
Ive been spending more than I ever have before lately
Probably have more than youve ever had before lately
Well yeah
yeah
there you go
So Im the nothing girl now thats good too
mm shut the fuck up and dont start this shit on me
Im starting to annoy you oh I met this I was in the middle of telling you
This class I was having
We were talking about like education and how it was used to be very like economically based like it was all just
like create workers for
the society it was like a factory model thing and
And all these things are coming out and
and even like the Wharton type people you know people who that I would think would like be more Erics wavelength that arent all
Happy happy happy peace to the world etcetera
And even they were like
backing me up on this point and Im like I wish Eric could be here because this is the one argument I could like use their support and he might even accept these peoples support
What was what was what was the argument abou
I dont remember it exactly but we were talking about
About of the fact like
the history of the educational systems and the factory based model like where educations are where education was just like
turning out future workers they were keeping their students basically had to survive in a corporate world but like factory world or
mhm
It was it was you know things I dont understand like the economy but
How you know I wouldve disagree
I y I dont know that you wouldve disagreed but I could hear you
Because it started that I was I
Whenever I take notes in class
like I take notes on what were talking about but like my first day of class I wrote a note to Jen Im like
Jen Im excited to be here
And in this class I wrote a note to Mike my friend from New Orleans and Im like Mike
um
I wish you were here right now youd love this professor too buh buh buh buh
oh Id love to hear your opinions I know theyd be mine and help support me and then I was like
0
I wonder what Eric would think about this then I dont know
And I think that was the day actually that I got your postcard it was like later like
mm
that day later it was a little weird
mhm
yeah
uhhuh last Friday
um
yeah one one day I wrote like you Mike Jen Gee Schmerls Andy
Frank and Todd
Wow

No Beth might Russ is going to come home soon I think Ru
But Beth might stay a little while longer and then shes not sure if shes going to
do something else with this company shes kind of not sure what shes up to
Do they have an address there but I hung out I hung out with

Is he is he better now is he like happy at leas
Well hes not in Spain anymore hes like he went to like
Turkey and then hes gon he was taking a train
from London to Turkey

Once national exams and then I
0
I would like I have like eight or nine days and I have this
U S Air airfare thing where the second person can fly either free or half price
mhm
so I thought if Beth is in France I would Jen and I would go visit her well meet you somewhere maybe or
Something like that I mean very very tentative just playing with the idea thing but
Thatll be cool
mhm
But I I need to get away I was supposed to be in New Orleans until tomorrow
Thats probably about the same t your spring break is probably about when Ill be in
France anyway
Was i
mhm
oh yeah fine okay
Beth was coming coming over to England in January I dont know if she still is with her mom
eh she doesnt know what shes doing
hm
See her mother might be going to England and she or something and then she was going to go too
yeah something like that
yeah I only ta Ive only talked to her once
hm
She was she was even in this weekend and I didnt see her
They all went out on Thursday night and no one ever called me
oh really
mm
So I havent seen her
But
So is Mike is Mike is Mike finally starting to work hard at law school
I think hes working hard like
In the beginning he said he was only going to go out on weekends I dont know if thats
true now or not
mhm
But Jen and he seem to be go out alot
together
But
yeah
Reall
yep
How about Schmerling have you heard anything from him
Like Schmerling goes out with them too
One night actually
probably the last time I went out like two and a half weeks ago three weeks ago it was
Mike Jen Schmerling me the guy Mikes going to live with Dave Abrams you know him righ
yeah he went to Emory
oh thats right I dont know him I knew of like I feel like I should know him so anyway Dave Abrams Melanie Laflin
And Jen Stein we all went to Milkbar
Jen Stei
yeah
That what the hell did that girl do with her lif
Did she graduat
yeah she
Shes waiting to get her certification I dont know if shes passed the exams yet
But shes substitute teaching
oh okay
And yeah
she prett
Is she prett
did she ever get good looking or n
I think she looks the same I dont know its a very
I always thought she was in a awkward stage shed grow out of it maybe not
I think I think
I dont know what did you guys find unattractive about he
In general
She had goo goo eyes I think I dont know
yeah I think those are always going to be like that
She had horrible hair too
yeah thats she cant help that though
Like people
I dont know she just wasnt pretty I dont know
yeah right well she basically has the same eyes and the same hair so
yeah I guess shes still ugly according to you I dont know
I thought Russ used to do the impression of her giving head it was so funny go all cross eyed and shit
okay
Must have been funny in high school
I dont know if he is anymore or not I havent seen him
When hes when his w when his minds with us he is
yeah
So what else was I saying so yeah so I seen like
Wait I was telling you about going out
And that was it was like because of something I was telling you that
hm
But I dont know
uh oh that was Schmerling so I saw Schmerling he was doing good
Hes been going out with like Mike and Jen alot too and I because I think he knows Dave Abrams from somewhere
Hebrew school
Is that what it was
mhm
Did he find a jo
um not since Ive spoken to him which has been like a week or two
Is he looking any prospects or no
um I think hes had interviews
Im happy
yeah I think so
Thats a big step
yeah I mean hes definitely like getting more into the looking for a job mode kind of thing but
oh hes been in it for awhile hes not ge hes been really into it
I was going to say like hes not one that I would ever doubt he would do that
mhm
Like hell be successful he might just you know hell work his way
He just doesnt have the op he doesnt have the first step hes never had a good internship hes always had to work hard every summer
Right
He needs a first he needs to settle for his first job and tell I dont know
If if you talk to him
message to him
yeah
well I dont want to preach to him
But I definitely learned over here that
eh before you get into marketing you have to first do sales
yeah
Not necessarily I have friends in NewYork doing advertising marketing and
they didnt do sales first but they had internships so
They had some kind of internship where they did sales or something like that
Had a advertising internship where I guess they kind of had their own accounts
Whatever but
But before marketing do sales okay
Even even even if theyre doing some advertising thing theyre not
Theyre not
Probably the first thing theyre doing is selling the advertisements thats probably what you do your first year
yeah the internship that I got offered was like basically it was um
Consulting but for an advertising firm like yeah go out there and
Like it was like yeah
Trying to sell the adver sales
yeah
Exactly before you can before you get into marketing yo you almost always have to do sales
So like well give you an account in a month or so but you know this is what you have to do and theyll youll design in a little while but
without
yeah you you have to you have to earn your yeah you g I think
I have to give Craig the number of that little firm that he might like that especially since they deal alot with golf products
mhm
And
And I know like it was piddly piddly money and stuff but
um I mean he could probably work and do a part time internship I
Im not sure if hes in the position where he can actually
Where he can work and do an internship part time
Well I dont I dont know maybe he is but I I dont know I think he needs more he he needs some money
Like he w hes working alotof hours at the golf course
yeah thats what Im saying that this is the kind of thing where he can fit in
mhm maybe maybe
I dont know
Hed probably have to work almost every night though I bet
I dont know
I have no money right now but I finally just got a loan Im so excited
mhm
Thats cool
My physical came the next day Im like oh
I havent gotten a paycheck yet Im getting one Tuesday Im dying for it
Reall
Have you like
Have you made alotof money because of commission and stuff
Ive only been working like two weeks Im broke though I need money so bad
yeah I just like
I never lived this poor in my life
This is the first time Ive really like
felt what its like to like not have
Jen I have a four pound a day budget
I spend two pounds on dinner and two pounds on lunch and thats it
Thats all I spend all day
Ive given up Eric Ive lived off of
Like
Like I dont think you understand Ive had spaghetti every night for three weeks straight
Eric I havent eaten because I dont want to buy my own food and if my parents arent bringing something in to me I dont buy food
Like I dont I would not be able to live on my own right now at all
Like I
I havent gone out only time I go out is when my dad gives me money to go out
And its horrible yeah Ive been sitting in alot reading
mm
I have this list of things that I you know I like buy
You at home stil
uhhuh
mhm thats what I thought
I have no one to live with
You talk to And
yeah well actually I left a message on his machine he was visiting Kim this weekend
oh yeah thats cool
And I found a place downtown thats perfect for him
Its a cigar bar its like no drinking but they
No he knows about it
oh he doe
Im pretty sure I I
oh I went by its right across from sugar mom
Theres alotof them actually downstairs theres one oh thats probably a real gay trendy one
No its not its like there were like biker men there
It or no
Theres one thats been theres one thats been in like Philly since like eighteen fifty its supposedly like its real yuppie but its supposed to be really cool
oh that wouldnt be this one but this one looks old but I w cant imagine
It could be that one I dont know
But it doesnt look yuppie in there at all
Its like its not yuppie but its kind of like trendy I dont know because like cigars are
People in here werent trendy like we went in
Like to go to a cigar do you do you realize how much youre going to spend on a cigar if you go to a cigar bar and smoke a g a good cigar its like six bucks a cigar
Well its like getting a drink at one of you know a bar that was like you know you get beer or you get a drink for six dollars you can have a cigarette for twenty five cents or a
Buts its not like
No its not its its like its more like
Because you can get a beer but you can get a cigar for like fifty cents
But its like what its more like its like not just getting a glass of wine its like getting
A f French glass of wine you know what Im sayin
yeah
Getting the
Its like getting like not just like not getting wine youre getting
Dom Perignon as opposed to like California sparkling wine
yeah exactly because like you know wines like like alotof people like that are just like theyre really
Its thats exactly exactly the same type of thing the conno connoisseurs
But I suppose these are people who are like connoisseurs of cigars they didnt look like they were doing it to be cool the place was more like a hole in the wall
mhm
Like you c like you know like you c youd definitely know the difference you know
Right
have you have you played at al
I totally forgot how to play are you kidding me Im so bad at
Did yo
games but dont tell him that
I think Dianes Dianes played a few times
tell him I play all the time
eh hu
Tell him I play all the time at least once a week
well I always get annoyed because every time we go over his parents house as were going over there on a Sunday or something he theyre all like
All right lets play cards
Lets play asshole when theres all these other games
Or you havent thought about Ho Chi Minh thing or what did they used to play Pat and those guys
oh Mao
yeah Mao thats right sorry Ho Chi Minh
m Ho Chi Minh is thats a c thats a catchy term
I knew it was something like that
And and Tim Harrington cheated for twenty years for the last fifteen years
I know
I know but you know he made the rules so
Isnt that hilarious
I know
I was thinking about them the other day because I thought um
oh because I was thinking for some reason it was such a silly thought I was thinking about architecture and I remembered that
I think they had a nice house
I started looking I was thinking about California style homes
yeah they had a beautiful house I never actually went to it but um I remember Carrie talking about it alot
they had a really nice house
its just modern
yeah it was modern it was sort of silly because it was almost right next door to that
It was Tims house righ
Crappy house that that Pat lived in
yeah
and it was I think it was right next to that
yeah it was Tims house and then his
wife moved in
yeah
when they got married I think
yeah she probably took him for half of it now so Im just joking
Who knows who owns the house
I dont
that other one too that had a really nice house the the one whose husband died
and then she moved to Los Angeles and they never heard hide nor hair of her again
um Arlene was that her nam
oh
oh
She was Asian I dont know whether she was Philippino or what but she was Asian so some kindof asian
oh I dont remember who that was
oh
You remember he
uh no I dont remember her
yeah
Because a
Her husband went down to Mexico
Because Ar Arlene Arlene was Tims wife
okay yeah and then there was another one whose
yeah
whose husband went down to Mexico and caught some
oh thats right
little virus
Thats right yeah
And they had a really beautiful house right there too
That was really sad
yeah yeah
Strange little block but then again in that area you sort of they dont people dont really care about
yeah
Big house next to small house sort of thing its like you take the view as you get it and thats it
yeah yeah
They build it higher and higher
yeah
mhm
well
So how you feeling you feeling
Energetic or tired or how you goin
yeah Im starting to get contractions now
yeah
Right
Painful contractions
gee god its going to come so fast yeah you still have two weeks left dont you
yeah but you know probably
Less than oh no less than that
No two weeks it was two weeks yesterday
Ten days
oh
and no I actually had a doctors appointment yesterday and
Everything is fine my doctor is like the most non
like I dont know whether hes just not interested or he just doesnt care or what but he told me I didnt even have to come in next week if I didnt want to
oh
That he would if I could find someone to take my blood pressure
mm
What was it take my blood pressure and check my urine I think
yeah
Im like how who the hell is going to take my
I have friends that
where the hell am I going to find someone to do that
Well we when I w when I had Tyson we had something called share care
hm
because well you said that you dont have private its all public there isnt
yeah theres no such thing as private here
yeah so I had I
paid for a private doctor and if I had private health insurance I couldve had him but I paid for him and
uhhuh
he would just do most of my checkups towards the end like he did it at twenty weeks and then like at twenty eight weeks and then as of about I think the last month
I had to see him once a week now
yeah
I almost couldve bagged those visits and and its a good thing he came to Harvey Bay he doesnt
he doesnt come here anymore now that the the only obstetrician that we have private obstetrician that we have in town is only in Mayorborough and hes
okay
which is a half hour away
yeah
and you basically just sit in the office and you come in and they just take your blood pressure and they talk to you how youre going and they might feel around the baby a little bit and theres no internal exam of course and then thats it I mean I could go to my doctor and do the same
so Im a little bit torn as to how to go next time as far as a pri you know going private at at all
yeah I would be so much different if I had a baby again I mean well we do plan actually on having more than one but
yeah
You know I I just I mean I just thought it would be so different I mean I I find that I dont need to see the doctor I have no desire to see the doctor you know
yeah y you sort of you get you get a bit afraid you know like I I was quite re you know I was always good with my visits and did my visits and and I sort of realized that
and I thought I would
yeah
uh I I dont think I actually did my followup with Doctor Stokes because oh no I did one followup
uhhuh
but I d I had to do another one I just didnt show up for that one because
it was sort of ridiculous at that point the the f the followup that he saw me after I had the baby was
Hows the baby how are yo
yeah
Hows it going fine well your
I know
Thats it see you
I know thats what the doctor does he makes sure that the baby is head down
hm
He takes my blood pressure
and thats it you know and its like you know by the time youve been pregnant for you know X number of months
hm
y youre the one whos going to know whether theres something wrong more than the doctor
Yes
I know
So you know its all up to movement if the baby stops moving then you know you dont call up the doctor you go straight to the hospital
Absolutely
So
yes and thats thats the scary thing isnt it
ohmygod I know I hate it when he stops moving
you
yeah
actually I was a bit bad too because I had you know you had to keep register of the the movement
mhm oh no they dont make us do that
Really oh you had to count and Id just get really lazy some days and just sort of you know lie on the sheet how many times
well it must have been hard for you too because I know like I sit at my computer all day long
yeah
So you know I can be fairly
Like its easy for me to tell when the baby is moving but when Im at home or Im standing up or Im walking around you know you just forget
oh yeah
yeah time goes on really quickly I mean I knew he was eh things were still going fine he was he was pretty active actually were going away tomorrow because we had made plans to go to the sunshine coast with my
uhhuh
parents so then were go were going to go now anyway we
oh
with Tyson and this is going to be
well we we took that trip with Tyson when we went of course to the state
uhhuh
You cant really plan on doing things with the kid you just sort of bring him along and then
in Ja in January we went
to this resort just across the island and
mhm
Thats when Tyson was about
fourteen months and that was a bit of fun because we you know
were staying at a resort and and he was in the pool alot and that was a bit of fun but there wasnt much else to do otherwise
So this time where were going is that theres alotof things to do were going to take him to this an oceanarium
oh thatll be fun
See the fish and
and seal shows and all this sort of stuff and then you can even
oh thatll be great
oh I know and you can pick up little turtles and all that sort of stuff and I just cant wait
oh
That is going to be so much fun
And
oh and then were going to the gingerbread factory and thats they have choo choo trains it has an animal park where you can pick up baby animals and oh I cant wait
god
I just cant wait were going tomorrow morning I was just so excited
thats so funny
I cant believe youre a mother its
youre going to be calling me up in a year and youre going to go
oh and were going here and were doing this and were so excited and we cant wait
Thats great I know
I think no
Right so
there was this one friend and her daughter is
like totally into the Renaissance period
so they go to Renaissance fairs to watch jousting tournaments
ohmygod

That aint bad at all
I told my mother to get a potty chair because I think he would use it
He read
He might be because he
he aint around no little kids
What I thought he go to a daycare
It aint no little kid
Theyre all potty trained and off bottles
He the youngest one there

Then she got one little boy and one little girl sometimes during the week
Other than that the rest of them are school age she only have them in the morning and a little time in the afternoon

Because you know its on its way to getting pretty cold
so

So what is the temperature no
About fifty

ooh I dont miss that weather
I bet you dont
yeah because its probably about seventy five degrees out here
you uhuh
mhm

I
Girl no
Thats one thing I dont miss the weather
and I dont miss the all the gangs and c
crime up in there n anymore either
0
oh I would love down there because yeah they got all of them professional teams down there
Please
Sure
Im be going to them basketball games all the time
yeah girl you had lied and said you was going to come visit one time
I might be able to
if I if I after my forty five hours I can start applying for scholarships
oh okay
you know I cant get no student loan
oh you owe them to
uhhuh
Who dont owe the
Im going to pay them back as soon as I get a job thats worthwhile though
Believe me
Get them off my back so my credit can start looking good again
you know but you think about all the student loans all the people that got student loans twenty years ago they aint thinking about it
They doctors and lawyers now
I know thats and then they not making some of them pay it back
mhm
and they worried about our little twenty five hundred dollars
yup
Make it bad on the people that come down the line thats all
That is it
you watch the million dollar ma I mean the Million Man March on T
I watched some of the
speakers and stuff
mhm
My m I think my mother recorded it
mhm
oh did sh
mhm
I watched some of the speakers and stuff
Wish I could have been there
I know that was something
I thought it was too
whoa
mhm
Just seeing all them black men
in one area
At one time getting along
yup
Getting along
But you know what the thing about it if you can organize something like that for a common cause
then you should be able to organize all people to feed off their own
you know
mhm
Shop in their own stores visit their own malls you know
yeah thats what I was thinking too
yep
If you can do that
Man if you can get the blacks in the government where they were suppo supposed to be instead of in prison
yeah
But the whi w you know we my
human relations teacher he was talking about that the other day
He said
that w the laws are catered to rich white men
Of course
and e
Thats why they can do embezzlement for two hu two hundred three hundred
thousand dollars
a couple of million dollars and go for six
and get ten months
go for six months come back out still got money stack
mm
and he was talking about
all the drug laws and stuff
its like slavery
Because he said cocaine and crack is the same thing but if
the white man get p
caught with
cocaine powder
he gets five years
Let a black man get caught with cocaine crack
He get life
He gets twenty seven years
yup
Exactly
and that is not right
and they know it aint right
Exactly
But thats how its set up
Its always been that way
and he said and its rich man rich white man against the minorities
All minorities
and thats true too
Once you start thinking about it
he said the rich mans drug is alcohol and cigarettes
and them the two leader killers
out of all the drugs
Its a hundred and ninety million a year
deaths
Reall
and he said c and all the rest of the drugs combined its only two hundred a deaths per year
mm
I was like ooh
But they dont never show them kind of statistics
Of course not
Just like they dont show the statistics that there are more
um white women
on welfare than black folks
On welfare
oh
Always have been
Well they wont show that one
and always will be

uhhuh
After all this time
In um oh in the in the envelope that I sent to you
uh there is your map Im returning it
and then theres a book called something about azaleas
and it is really interesting
I never knew it had been written
its written by one of the German Notre Dame sisters
no kidding
who went to Dachau every week
to take food and to take all kinds of messages
ohmygod
and I think maybe shes still living
anyway ah the name azaleas
attracted me and then when I read it I thought gee this is really interesting
so I thought youd like to read it and if you want to send it on to the Dequeens
okay
you know thats fine
but it was really really interesting I couldnt hardly believe it
hm
oh I did finally send the package to them
oh did yo
yeah but I havent heard from them so I dont know
mhm
presume it got there okay and everything
yeah yeah
well I havent heard anything from Frank whom I wrote to uh in Florida
I did hear from Betty who is the person in near Green Bay Luxembourg
who is married to a Declean connected with the Father Decleans
and shes the one that gave me alotof this information and I told her
that now we found this Robert and Marie and we didnt know his connection
so I gave her his fathers name and his grandfathers name and dates
and I said you know if theres any way you can figure this out
and so she said they were going to have some kindof a reunion
with their immediate family and she would ask you know whether anyone knew anything
so I havent heard
hm
you know
and where is she from agai
shes from Luxembourg
mhm
but shes not natively a Declean its her husband and hes connected with the Father Decleans
oh I see okay
either the Father Decleans or Jack and maybe its the same one I cant remember
you know the Jack shoe shoe perso
oh yeah mhm
in the shoe place in Green Bay its either that Jacks family
or its the two Father Decleans and I dont know which one
mm
well I have greetings from a whole bunch of people
when I went to a Chicago meeting
wh
um were doing something called Nama North Ameri
yes right I think
Major Area okay So I went to the Chicago meeting instead of going to the Milwaukee meeting
so Joanna from Saint Annes asked about you
oh no kidding
yes
yeah ohmygosh
and Sister Anna Marie
oh yeah
she a classmat
yes
and Sister Claire
classmate too yeah
and Sister Margaret Rose
yes classmate
and Charles Marie from Alfonses
Charles Marie
I thought thats what she said
mhm
but Im not sure
okay that I cant place immediately
mhm
I mean I was at Alfonses but Im trying to think Charles Marie
or she may have changed her name or something
yeah that could be
that could be
she just said Alfonses and I thought oh well
mhm
well know what that is
mhm
yeah she could certainly have changed her name
and then this weekend I saw Sandy
and she had talked about their meeting this summer
and I said well Joyce wanted to make that
mhm what um
what did she happen to say or maybe you didnt think to ask her but they manage to get together before Rosario died or
no I think Rosario died before
I think Rosario died before I had asked someone else that
ah I dont know who I asked
but Im quite sure it was before
oh okay
but she said they went out to Macquan
and they had a tour
mhm
and she said it was really interesting
mm
we have a thing going at um at the college there
and its all about sister Sister six toes
they opened this one room in the basement and there was something that looked like a casket
and so they just named it Sister six toe
and so when the freshmen come they tell them about sister six toes and theyd better be good or shes going to get after them
is that craz
just one other rumor we have to overcome
right
right
its funny because one time
0
I have several workers I had last year several students from
Concordia who came and worked
and worked worked with students with me
and so one day I said well would you give me a tour
and so they took me out and showed me you know
all the things that were different and all the things that were the same
then we went over to the guest house um we were way over on the lake
mhm
and they had like forty or fifty boys in that one little place
like four in a room and double bunks you know
anyway we were coming up to the door and I looked down at the mat
and there it said F F N D and I said
wow and the boy said well we dont know what that is its been there a while and we dont know what that means
and I said well I know what it means
huh
you know it means School Sister of Notre Dame
and so then on our way out he said do you want to take that with you I said no I dont
I want it to stay right here so you remember us
so it was kind of interesting
party boys
yes do you remember how big that building i
no but
how small it is
isnt that big I can remember
I know it its awful
I just saw one of the rooms and I mean it was just body to body and bed to bed
I dont know how they can do it
theyd have to go to the library to study because they surely couldnt study there
anyway
that was the patron for visitors right of
yeah for yeah
families of yeah
right for guests
mhm gosh
mhm
isnt that somethin
that is
so they have I didnt know they had
residential
oh yes
oh
we have changed all the dorms in the high school
in the candidature in the novitiate no not the novitiate the novitiate I think theyve kept like as a retreat center
for couples but the candidature and the asyrinsure
all of the rooms have been converted
all of the dorms have been converted to I I dont know maybe six rooms
but real walls you know and really complete
hm
yeah mhm
and its boys and girls I think maybe certain wings are one sex or another I dont know for sure
but both floors and they have I think theyve tripled their enrollment
hm
since they moved out there
no kidding
and they thought they were going to lose
aye yay yay
isnt that somethin
yeah I know they thought they were going to lose
yeah
wow
yeah
so its been a good move for them
for sure for sure
and today I just got home from I dont know if you know it but were
were in the middle of a big fund drive
as always were running out of money and
is one of the people whos asking people for money
or
yeah he did tell me that when he called yeah
he did he yeah
and um for that celebration which is going to be in March I guess for the ending of it
were having a Sisters choir sing
and I just came back from practice at Elm Grove
with Sister Anne Celine oh Sister Anne Celine Anne Celine Doan
yeah
directing us
oh
yeah and were doing about four songs from the Mount Mary hymnal
praise be to you oh Lord
ohmygosh
and ah ReginaCaeli and were doing of course the Magnificat
though it was really
so I think were having maybe four or five practices and then were supposed to
so I think there are about maybe thirty of us
anyone who wanted to could you know join the group
and I missed the first practice so I thought hm I can make the second one
hm
cushy is it
yeah
I sent a card to
I I think it just went out
yesterday before I knew it I just got the idea I put Mayor Mayor Declean
and then underneath I put Mayoress Leona Declean
how cute
oh that is darling
and I congratulated them both
aw thats nice
because I really think you know
yeah
thats all a part of it
yes and Leona is really
mhm
So fun
yeah I I teach
um one from Mexico
Do yo
But yeah
But he has a hard time remembering
Of course you know if they dont practice during the week you know
Right thats w the most important thing
yeah and then when they
Im surprised he does
When they go to work alotof them are Mexican so then they speak
so they dont get the practice
yeah
yeah oh thats a shame oh
So did you get your wedding pictures and all ye
No well I got a few snapshots but nothing from the professional
Mom still has them
oh you didnt get
I dont know if sh she
Did you get to see the proofs then before you wen

So when are you having a celebration over there or did
We already had it

It was really nice
Made lots of little like pick up type foods and
mhm Just like your mom would do

that some of the latest now is having a cheesecake
oh really
yup that yeah and having you know like you had flowers and things

uhhuh
that they can come and inspect your home and that its oh good thing your mother is not you know stopping to do it
uh
That was in Wisconsin I dont know about Illinois
Maybe
But
so theyve probably buckled down on that
yeah
you know people doing things at home
right
mm
So and then you know some halls wont I mean some yeah some places wont accept those kind
yeah
so
They were almost going to give mama half
uh
then if if people get you know food poisoning they get in trouble
yeah right yeah I suppose thats why
but this was in you know
yeah
uh Milwaukee had that
oh
So

We went and we made sure we got to the Australian part
oh fun
It was neat because well we w we went mainly to see the part that was newly constructed
Louise hadnt been there last year and so
uhhuh
I knew what was there the year before
oh right
And so then we went walking we got our walk in so we walked
About an hour and I got
hm
After work just sometimes
as Im always racing the clock Edna praying for green lights as I go
oh gosh dont you hate that
oh
ah thats terrible
So yeah
oh its de the its definitely a different area here
Its really Its been cool but
You dont have mountains do yo
No were in the hills
oh youre in
Where we live right theres a set of like small small hills
oh
and so we live up on a a hill
Its like a little a little hill range you kno
oh
But there there arent any mountains
I think down south there are a few real small ones
oh
But there arent many
And you got a little house is it similar to
yeah
yeah its yeah
oh
Its about oh no smaller than theirs
Its about their size of their sitting room kitchen and one bedroom
oh yeah
yeah and so its not its not real big but its attached to someone elses house
mhm oh its attached
So we kind of go to the back of yeah we go to the back of their house
uhhuh
and and use different doors but the same walkways
and what do they call tha
thats a granny flat
oh a granny flat
yeah
I know when I was in Arizona the alotof times you know the
family would have the big house in the front and then add a smaller house
right
you know
just a short distance behind like in the backyard
yeah
and that was for the for the their p parents
uhhuh
Yes yes see this was originally built for their parents
oh
yeah
But I think her mom died
oh
So theyve been really nice
Theyre a really nice couple that you know she she comes and sees me and
mhm
She always wonders if Im okay being far from home
About how far away is that from your from your inlaw
oh probably twenty minutes
oh
So its yeah fifteen twenty minutes
Its not bad
We see them quite often
Theyre real real close family so
yeah
I we we see them once or twice a week
How did grandma enjoy her tri
oh she had a really good time
In fact this is funny her the people from Scotland that she went to visit after
ou the week she was with us
yeah
um then they came down here for four weeks
oh well that was nice
so they just left last Sunday
oh neat
So I got to spend time with them
They were really nice
hm
Really funny and then they left and she had two Swiss visitors come in
and stay for three days
while they were here
a right after they left
oh right after
she was hoping to have a couple days off and
uhhuh
a few friends of Leiths came in and and kind of stayed with them so
mhm
poor lady
she just got rid of all her visitors and
Had had a busy busy week couple weeks so
We just had them over for dinner tonight
oh you di
yeah we had a roast beef and some mashed potatoes and stuff so
That was nice
You know when I talked to your mom the other day she said something about I dont know theres somebody looking at their house to buy it
yeah
No its not that way
yeah
So they havent decided yet
I thought Yvonne was wanted to move there
yeah she had
I dont know I dont know what happened with that
If they just decided they couldnt afford it or
yeah
or what but someone was interested
One of Brendas friends
Said that she was interested in buying a house and
possibly you know mom and dad
So I think they came and looked at it and then um
Twice they came and looked at it
Thats all I heard
And then mom and dad are still deciding whether they want to do that or not
yeah
You know whether
yeah well then I was asking them about last summer
They were saying
that one of the girls would maybe build a house and then they would have a smaller one behind
mhm
but your dad was say oh I talked to him on his birthday thats when it was
mhm
then they were saying you know that
well if whoever would have it would have to you know buy that land and all that kind of stu
hm
too you know that
Right
Your dad wouldnt be able to own the land
Right
and someone else build on the you know have the house
The one who builds the main house has to be the owner of the land
Right it can be get kind of sticky
yeah
So I think they wanted to stay away from that
All that red tape all the time
yeah right
Too much yeah
so they wanted to stay away from that and just kind of
uhhuh
build on their own for now
yeah
You know because theyre not ready to move in with somebody you kno
no no
Theyre not
But yet you know they dont really need that big house now but
No thats what I said I told mom its just too hard for mom to keep up all by herself
Well theres nobody there to mess it up
I know but everybody stops over
Youd be surprised
Right yeah
Shed clean it up
Wed both have it cleaned up and then
I know
You know and somebody stops with five kids and its messy in five minutes
that doesnt take long
No and its not their fault
She loves them to stop but then shes got to clean it up
have you heard how Sylvias doin
No
oh
I know she had
Did she have she had her second operation righ
oh did sh
I dont I dont know
yeah I think she did
She looked good at the wedding
yeah she did She came over a few days a f a few weeks after the wedding too before we left and she was fine
She was doing real good
oh that was before she had her second surgery then
Right right
and theyre going to be here
well
if I come out to visit you that will make it easier too I can
see them at the same time
When are they going to b
um well she goes to Wilston Northampton
uhhuh
And they she said
um the mom
I just spoke to her a few minutes actually
sh I suppose I was talking to her when you tried to call
um
been a busy night
m
um
I think she said sh
theyre coming maybe on the twenty ninth
So and I told them if they needed any help
okay
um
you know
I I kind of I cant make any plans for the twenty ninth until I know
mhm
Sure no thats fine
But
but basically I mean
heck it might turn out that you know if they fly in to Boston I can
drive them
To western Mass
out to western Mass and
visit you on our way to New Hampshire
Well
Right
I dont know
I want you for more than a couple of hours
So
yeah
No no
Im talking about more than a couple of hours
um
Cory and Paula
will also be with us for Christmas
Wow
But
really
anywhere almost anywhere in that whole time frame Im home
Yall could come out
okay
So
yeah
Is there any time thats better than any othe
Well Christmas day probably wouldnt be the best
yeah
But it wouldnt be that bad
yeah
um just try to think I
e Cory usually the way they have us sleeping is Cory and me in my room
and Paula in the back room
But we have put Paula in
the living room
So actually there would be room for
all of us to be there
yeah but she shouldnt be kicked out for
No I mean Paula sometimes sleeps in the living room
I think it may be a more comfortable mattress
I mean
ah
it wouldnt be kicking her out
Thats Paulas normal place to sleep when shes
so
okay
Well
um
e my
So it n it really doesnt matter I guess
okay
My my schedule is definitely
I dont want to subject you to Christmas
I mean I dont know
But
um well thats
probably not the best
they
I have to
see you know how Nathaniels feeling
Absolutely
yeah
about being social
Sure
um but I know he very much
would of course like to see you
I mean that just depends like the if we come before Christmas or after Christmas
mhm
mhm
What I could definitely see happening is a post Christmas pre New Hampshire
okay
visit
Something like the twenty sixth to the morning of the twenty ninth
Or
That would be so lovely
Or something like that
That would be so lovely
yeah
And we could just play
Ye we could just play
And all three of us will need to do so
yeah
yeah
Youre right
Im so glad Im going to get to see you again so soon
I feel spoiled
Yes I know
Is this like a treat or wha
I just saw you in August
hey this moving back to this continent thing has its
i it really does
It really does
has its
pluses
oh
yeah
Its going to be good
yeah
So oh yeah like another thing this is I dont know how close were getting to our thirty minutes this is not something to like drop on you but and its not like Im thinking about doing it right now
mhm
yeah
Although theres a story about what I am thinking about doing right now
Anyway
Youre getting married
yes
No
God no
But Im having major baby pangs
Like
Wait is this what you were going to drop on me or
Well I mean its not this is the thing that Im not going to do like tomorrow but
okay
um
but at some point when Im somewhat more established
I mean for so long I was sure I didnt want to be a mother
And now
I really think I do
I think I want to have a baby
And like be a mom
oh
Great
yeah
So
and
every time I say it
Because one of my friends has to have a baby before I do
Every time I s oh I dont know if itll be before you
Every time I say it Heather says
Im not ready to think about that yet r
I told her Im not think about it tomorrow
But you know this is just something Im thinking about and I think I want to do it
And the other night she said you know
I think I might want to be a mom too
So we may each be moms for no like
Wow
where were going to find the dads
But
yeah
mm
Thats a problem
Could be
yeah
ouch
But
But
I dont know
I mean it would be interesting if my brother were willing to donate
eee
For
Heather
yeah
Because then it would be it would have some blood
God
And some McNealy blood
But she doesnt have any acceptable male relatives
so
Wow
Anyway
yeah
So theres that
And
but thats not like
you know news of the moment or anything
Thats just something Im thinking about that I wanted you to know
And
the other thing is Ive been thinking about and I I think Ive pretty much just decided not to do it but
I was thinking about being an egg donor actually at a local
Wow
reproductive medicine clinic
um
largely because it paid fifteen hundred dollars
But I went in for the preliminary exam
um an interview
did that just yesterday
and
Aside from it sounding kind of scary
I mean I could probably do scary for fifteen hundred dollars
um
its like a two to three month process which I dont have
So
oh
yeah
So but I did find out that I have
acceptably positioned ovaries
And
so you know maybe at some point in the future
huh
Kind of sucks though
The fifteen hundred dollars would have come in handy
Well theres always SanFrancisco
Right
Right
I figure its probably not exactly a novelty out there
So
thats something I may do at some point in the future
Though e on my way home on the bus Im thinking
Im like selling my body here
They call it oocyte donation but they pay you fifteen hundred dollars to do it
yeah
So its not really donation
Thats very interesting
It is interesting
Its not some
Its a very interesting process really
Really
yeah
I mean they explained like how they use the hormones to
like turn off your ovaries and then
overstimulate them and
then how they harvest the eggs
Which is not exactly a pleasant sounding experience
yeah
I I kind of heard something about that
mhm
So
I had a vaginal ultrasound which was really interesting
So I like saw my ovaries on the little screen and
Ugh
oh it didnt hurt
It was easier than a pelvic
ohgod I have to go in and have one of those
I havent had one in over a year now
I usually have them every August
Sorry
yeah I have them in the spring
yep
sorry
Didnt mean to bring up a bad thing
No thats okay
Ive been meaning to do it for two weeks i
Just when do I have the time
yeah
You know
So true
so
So Becker is sounding better to me
yeah actually shes coming to see me again
oh good
yeah shes coming next weekend
So youre not coming out to see me huh
hu
Th this fall youre not coming out to see me
e I Im
sorry
No
The last time we talked you you thought you might
It was a possibility
I know
I thought Id love
okay
to
but I think
I think theres probably
ohmygod
Its okay Tasha
No its okay
See part of whats
see I have this
big paper that Im really excited about that Im going to do about ten times
too much work on which is a good sign because that means that Im doing like my e
like as well as I did in Mount Holyoke
Right
e
e that I I just
actually I dont know
like
if Im going to do a good job on it but Im really excited about it
thats going to like take up as much time as possible till December sixth
m
Im also having from the time Becker comes
well Becker comes for one weekend in November
Good
And then my
pare my mom comes
something like
the twelfth or something for Thanksgiving
ohmygod
I dont know shes going to be here for some
ungodly long time
And then your d is your dad coming out to
yeah he th hes coming out the morning of Thanksgiving he and my brother will arrive and th
theyll only n the
the day after all of them leave
Ursula is coming
oh wow
to stay for a week
So November is like
ohmygod
I mean in a way its really good because it will get me to when Nathaniel gets b
because this month has been s
so long
yeah
I have never experienced
such a long month in my life
oh
I know what you mean
July was like that for me
yeah
yeah
um and in a wa I mean
November will fly it seems and after that I can tell myself you know well
December is here it means Nathaniel is coming home now
Thats right
And I might as well save myself that
way for twenty one days
Sure
um
but
i
but
i on the other hand Im really scared because I have all this work
The the
Right
The main thing is this anthropology class that Im having trouble
hm
with
You know I take
two ah about a month just in the writing of a twenty page paper not talking about any of the research
mhm
Right
And
w th
cla this anthropology class has
this paper thats due on Monday
a five page paper a twenty page paper and a final take home exam
Which seems a little heavy but anyway
um
That does seem rather heavy
yeah
The thing is that the the papers are cumulative in a way
so I cant start on the twenty page paper until after I turn in the five page paper
oh
Right
Right
which is scaring the shit out of me
Beyond that the day after that paper is
due I have my take home final for my law class due
And
I hate to I mean
e this is like completely different from the whole discussion that you and I had on this and I will never admit to my parents who felt I should take the sociology class
this
but
I was right to
take the law class for the reasons that I was considering
mhm
But my mind is not interacting with that information
uhhuh
Like its not that I dont understand it
Its just like my mind is not picking up and saying oh this is interesting what about this and this and this and like nothings ha
Right
Right
oh Im sorry
Dead
Besides that I manage to make the stupidest comments of the year every time I open my mouth in that class
oh I hate that
So I just sit in the back
or actually I sit in the front row which is awful
Because then I feel like everyone is looking at me
Theyre all thinking Im stupid
And
e I its really weird
I think people must because
the way people sit
I am
isolated
oh
Like no one ever sits in the row where I sit
So Im like ohmygod Im a law school leper
yeah because
different things the way they are said here than in contrast to the way theyd be said in other countries
yeah
yeah Your Columbian Spanish wont work hu
yeah so yeah
I know And she said she could when I in talking she said I can tell that you were taught
By Castilians
oh ah
You know just the way you say different things
yeah she can t so it was its been interesting
Now where did you start off anywa
In Columbia in Bogota Columbia
oh I see
Well that was good
And then and then go Gordabatca which was a little different
uhhuh mhm
And theyve got expressions that arent used down here and visa versa
yeah yeah
So its been I mean its its interesting just being you know getting clued in to the Chilean way
yeah we had a a professor from the University Madrid
who was on campus for a while at Rosemount
mhm
and she was a Castil what do you ju call a Castilian of the Castilians
Vicks mhm the T H the T H
oh Im telling you yes and every once in a while she would say something in sort of Spanish
oh youre like wait for me
She was awfully nice
I love it
really
aw
really yeah
So how does your family feel about you being this down here in Chil
oh
its so so
Its interesting because most of the family was really excited and in fact
Francis and Rich would like to come down at some point Tricia teaches Spanish up in Alaska
oh terrific
She would like to come and work in a sh to do an and then also
and bring her suits right
um Nancy Teds wife
um is a Spanish professor
And so she would like to come down
hm
and te you know she goes just to take just to have the time to be there not
necessarily to do anything but just to be able to interact with the people and all
yeah and talk yeah
so right and talk right so
you
ah the three of them
which
you know would like to
would you have
uh my mom
Sorry
yeah
okay my mom would like to k
so I guess they
you cant talk at the same time
oka
Im okay Im being quiet now
Its your turn
okay
Because I keep getting I keep getting i I ke it keeps shutting off
Can you hear tha
No
oh okay well Ill anyway my mom would like to come down
But h her comment was when I was leaving she goes well Ill give you at least two weeks and then Ill check you out
oh
b But she has h I I doubt if shell come
oh if it would be this year if she comes
oh
Itll probably be some time next year
yeah yeah
so
Well your sister Karen lives in Portland
Is that correc
Yes
or well at any rate Roseanne went out for the one hundred fiftieth you know holy child jubilee
Yes
celebration and she said it was Karen your s I cant remember her last
mhm
She said she would
Karen Day
She yeah she was in charge of it and she said it was very very nice
oh good
Karen did a wonderful job
yeah
Its great
oh good
And my sister Therese played the piano for the celebration
oh gee you know more about it than I do
Well see I because it was Thereses birthday
oh I didnt realize that
And since Karen was in charge of the whole thing our practically our whole family got involved as far as getting things ready
uhhuh
We worked on the mailing and we did
uh any of the organizational part Karen kept getting Francis or or Therese or Monica or whoever was around just to help her out
mhm mhm
But then they said th my mom also said that at the mass I think Francis and Karen were both Eucharistic ministers as well
oh
So it was very nice
Boy a family affair hu
Right
So well Im glad to hear I mean its nice to hear from other people too that it was a nice
a nice time because you never kno you kno
yeah yeah right well you know families are biased right
Yes

So shes doing okay to a certain extent
Shes just found out she has glaucoma
aw
so she has to theyre
well is it
is it
go ahead
is it is it treatabl
Because sometimes they can just do surgery for that
Well right now I dont think shes thinking of the surgery but she uh shes doing some drops
yeah
and its an experimental drug that theyre going to try for two weeks to see what happens
oh uhhuh
but see her the reason why she I mean she finally went and got her eyes checked She was driving
um the week before I went out to visit her she was driving and driving down the middle of the lane
oh oh
and she went through she went through two stop signs and never realized that she had gone through them
oh
So it was a little scary
yeah yeah
but she ye and she finally said Im I wont drive at night anymore
Well the whole time I was home she never drove
uhhuh
You know she just kept she just kept asking me to drive which was fine
yeah yeah
but then she finally got her eyes checked and she does have glaucoma so
mhm oh I hope they can do something for her because shes just so active
yeah
God wears you out
I know I know
true
mm
gee it was so nice to have you all here
so
for your jubilee
You know youre youre mothers extraordinary
mm
That was fun
and she

So it was a neat experience for her and for Monica
oh
uhhuh
so
yeah to see what whats going on and ah anyway well
How are you doin
Fine were
oh good
the library is getting automated
ooh perfect
yeah yeah and theyre looking for a name for the catalogue you know the online catalogue
uhhuh
Libraries get fancy when it comes to naming it for example the
mm
the NewYork Public Library theirs is named Catnyp
C A T N Y P
oh perfect
yeah I think that thats the most clever Ive heard so far
uhhuh
and then somebody else has Holy Family College has The Family Cat
uh
You should have a contest at the college
But we are
oh good
and its its open to all students faculty staff administrators and S A C J
oh perfect well
So if you want so if you want okay
Ill start thinking
okay
but think quick and send it right away
okay Rosenip ok
Does it have to end in ca
no no anything you want at ju
oh alright
something that is you know unique and short
uhhuh mm
and has something to do maybe with the trend tradition of the college something like that
okay
and the pri the prize is a one hundred dollars gift certificate to Borders which is a marvelous bookstore
alright
You can come up here and spend it righ
oh that would be fun
Or I could spend it for you
That would be fun
Youll have no trouble I Id be glad to hand it over because I doubt if theres a Borders down here
yeah and Im sure that itd be pretty safe to think that Anyway you can submit as many as you want
you know as many entries as you want
If its an acronym please explain what it spells
okay
okay
Somebody has some college Ive forgotten what it is has L I B R I S you know for books
uhhuh perfect

We al we also need students so if you have any students that youd like to send up
oh okay
and
Do you How is the new person doin
Very very very very very well

Terrific
People really like her and shes so
oh good
honest and forthright and shes really a a most extraordinary person
oh good mm
and and she is so dedicated to Rosemount Its really amazing
um
One thing that is a problem is the money
mm
yeah and so if she can get money then everything will be fine but its
mhm Now is she responsible for that hersel
Well it to a certain extent yes yeah she really ha
mm you dont have a de
We dont have well weve lost alotof people so we dont have a good development group at all
mm
I mean there there should be someone in charge of that but there there isnt
mhm
but her background is very much in finances
oh wow
she was chief financial officer at Bryn Mawr College
mhm
So she really knows money
mm
But i you know getting it out of people is is not ea
yeah
so keep praying for that

It wasnt it was strong but it wasnt that I i I mean everybody just
yeah
I mean
Panic
how long would it have taken to go back and say how much do I ow
yeah yeah yeah just throw some money
but anyway so so how are the girls liking it and stuff Roy
oh they love their school an and they both get got real good teachers and Steffis Steffis teacher has real horrendous spelling I mean
She was at my first parent teacher conference at
youre joking
eh she was showing me theyre learning letters and sounds
mhm
so she says oh yes we were writing down N words
she had written down necktie N E A K T I E and
Good Lord that
ah an n necklace after that was also spelled
with an
terribly wrong and so I just I pointed out necklace and then I
said ooh wait theres more I said well I better stop counting
Wed better
but in the least
Im just glad that hes for not first grade teacher
No yeah but shes but shes really a wonderful peppy lively you know
mhm
Fun per fun person and you know Steffi is really happy
in and Elises teacher is wonderful really really nice just just
adorable lady that you know just oh ah Elise is so sweet and I just love her and shes such a good student and blah blah blah
yeah
Shes just you know and shes really
good I mean ah I Elise is
Elise is like reading books like crazy
Shes like Mom I dont know I just love reading now and I just you know shes really
Well thats wonderful
Shes really excited about school so and and shes you know shes made some friends here both of them
and
but in the neighborhood theres there are two kids that live across the street that go that go to a private Catholic school close to here so they dont go to the same school
but like the boy is in second grade and the girl is in sixth grade and they and they play really well with Elise and Steffi
and then theres another little girl who stays with her grandma till her mom picks her up after work whos in I think shes in first grade
and shes comes over here almost every day too to play with them and stuff so
So theyre you know theyre theyre basically pretty happy since um you know they like their school and theyre
Well thats thats thats yeah Sylvia it sounds like the
yeah
Only monkey or the the yeah
yeah y you know mhm
It yeah well yeah I we should have known
Well did you hear the horror stor
Well he was there for like a mo like the forty day
From
oh well this is
He was supposed to be there for five days right but of course the tests showed that he had
pyro
plasmosis
which is a blood disease
And what is tha
a blood disease
mm
Of course
This had to happen of course
But that was like major trauma and we were having major problems because of this major trauma
It was alright till you
And so
And finally then he yo you know calls all over Mexico and all over Texas blah blah blah to find out do you know whether you can treat this or not
finally finds out from his in Tuzla that oh sure you can treat that dont worry blah blah blah
So he goes down but to make sure he actually you know treats it and gets rid of it he a he goes down twice
in the rain stays overnight for a night or two each time
no two or three nights each time at hotels and stuff and then
and is giving this treatment to this
horse and blah blah blah comes back then goes back down gives him another treatment and then comes back then has to go back down for when they take the
blood out again after another two weeks
What a nightmare
So and
what a nightmare
yeah and
He was the horse was there for like six weeks ah you know costing us you know more than much more than we had ex
than the horse is worth
that we had ex wa wanted
You know much definitely much more than it was worth to me
And and but finally it did get cured
and so what the second time they they approved it to come across the border blah blah blah
And the only sort of good thing that happened in relation to that horse so far is that
in looking at stables and stuff around here it turned out somebody said theres a stable real close to your house
but theyre very expensive
So we go there I said well lets just
go look at it and see if maybe we can strike some kind of deal with them or whatever
turns out that these people are their daughter was kicked in the head last
last year by a horse and was in a coma and so theyre like have major bills and stuff too
but they wa theyre building a new stable an and want to build a new house and stuff
mhm
So they we made a deal with them but Betsy would drop their plans for this
ah
this place in exchange for the first month
uh rent and board
mhm
and it is right down the street from our house
Its really really incredibly convenient for Beto
But now theyre theyre leasing this property theyre on and Beto says theyre moving by the middle of November
So now we have this other you know dilemma now wheres he going to put it now and hes
tonight hes off to a meeting
With some here that and hes going to see if hes going to
Did he hook up with some people he had met befor
uh no no
hm
Well actually hed actually some of these people that he eh one of these guys whose
going with to the meeting with tonight actually said that he knew
a that Beto knows in Tuzla
uhhuh
Not one of his friends but someone someone that Beto knows in Tuzla
So its kind of funny he said what a small world you know
um because this this guy apparently used to live in Guadalajara and knew this guy too but isnt that funn
And so wait so hes still but I cant why cant he find a jo
Is there no jobs for him or wha
Well first of all because hes got blue blood you know so
oh because I was going to ask you about Michael and Megan if they came in August
If they did I didnt hear from them
oh because Susan had said they were going to hopefully go
Well they we she was waiting for their father to send them some money so that they could go for the month of August
Because I guess there was going to be a wedding and so forth
But I
oh if they came we didnt hear about it
oh well I havent talked to Susan since spring time or when Mae got home
yeah
So
So well I understand why
somebody would be really ticked at me seriously ticked
yeah well sh shes forgiven that
So
Along with all the other stuff that went on
Well
so and Maes one of the few people that Krissy even feels she can talk to
oh well
So maybe because her life isnt as messed up as Maes
Not quite not quite as messed up
Makes her feel good
I dont know
Boy sounds like Maes is really messed up
yeah
yeah
fucked up Aziz Is going to Abu Dhabi
oh she i
for soccer
Well now that shes finished getting rid of her appendix she doesnt have to worry about that this year
oh
so shes going to Abu Dhabi on
um junior varsity team
When for wha
for soccer
junior varsity for wha socce
soccer yeah
okay
J V soccer and then shes going to go out for varsity basketball
and theyre going to go to Damascus but thatll be by ah bus
thatll be next quarter
um when is she going to Abu Dhab
uh the end of this month
hm
uh maybe no wait maybe its the first of December
Ag
yeah parts partly no end of November Its the last week in November Decem in first of December
mm Well Im writing this down so I can tell daddy everything
Sa
some
yeah
uh well thats good
um I
did Kitty tell you that I mentioned to father that
We we are going to go to Jordan ah next summer
You did and what did he say
He said you know and I said you know Im thinking that we could go and see
um oh whats her name in Austria for two or three da
uhhuh
huh
yeah
for two or three days and then go on to Jordan
and then well take a little trip for maybe a week before we come back
Something like
going on a barge along the canals in either France or Germany or Holland
and he said
ooh that sounds nice
huh
That sounds nice
oh one of those countries
I said that Ive heard about these trips
and walk along side or run along side or beat the b barge to the next bridge or whatever you know
huh
yeah
but that you can they because they go so slowly
and I said it would be a wonderful relaxing trip after having been to Jordan
And he says and who is going to pay for thi
and because he had told me before it would cost us about five thousand dollars to go
yeah
And so I said my mother and father are going to pay for it
I said I have never spent any of that money that they left
and they are going to pay for this trip
he says oh
like okay
oh okay
So anyway doesnt that sound goo
sounds great to me
I Im going to call a travel agent which I have not done yet but a travel agent who
gets trips going for North Jesco for women
yeah
and ask her if shes got anything really interesting that these two old folks would like to do one in good condition and one not and
then Im going to work on our passports and stuff so that you know I would suggest that you dont tell the kids yet just in case this falls through
okay
but if I you know as I learn stuff Ill let you know
okay
okay
Sounds good
yeah
Ye and
We well start preparing
Well you know think about it
I dont know what you have to do to prepare but just think about it
Well we we got the car
oh I was going to ask you about that
oh yeah the girls now wave goodbye to their friends instead of hiding under the seat
Hell everybodys hap It gets dusty all the time time because its
oh
dark blue one
You drive with your lights on because its people can see you
No everythings pale around here so the dark blue shows up real well
no you still drive with your lights on because if you go into a shadow
yeah
you then people can still see you
oh well Not too many shadows here
yeah
um the Some sweet small child
drew a Star of David on the front hood this morning
oh that didnt go over
I said oh good nothing like making us a target guys
That should go over well
I okay this is nice you know
so I I kind of changed it a little bit made it a little pointy
rubbed the edges
oh great I figured its time to start out WASP
oh which reminds me which reminds me you said e in one of your letters all the kids at
in your class and how they speak different languages
uhhuh
and somebody speaks Hebrew
How di how did that person get in ther
because we have a new diplomatic mission in Amman
Tha oh because of the peace process
Right
oh
So I have I have Yanni Atar and Inbal Lavi
Two little kids
yeah one is is in the kindergarten section
uhhuh
Thats Yanni and Yannis a little stinker
Yanni San Jonathan and but hes hes come along pretty good actually he was born in Brooklyn
oho really
uh
Spent the first three years of his life in in NewYork and uh
So hes this is all coming back to him
Hes heard alotof English he just hadnt used it
very much but its like in the back of his mind so hes beginning to use it
mhm
and doing pretty good when he listens ha ha
And when he doesnt hes all over the place
mhm
He sits there and talks
yeah and what wheres the other little wheres the other little ki
Is this a a siblin
No Inbal is
Lavi her last name is Lavi and shes in the preschool section
and she is shes often in another world
She has not
got a clue about English at all
um but she shes coming along too though
um well Hillary said the other day
Inbal knows a little bit of English
and I said oh reall
What makes you think s
She says well
When she pointed to the ball she said it was brown
and when Mrs
Farhun asked her to go get Abrahim she said Abrahim
oh
I said well shes got two two words Abrahim and brown
yeah right and what was the other language a language I never heard of before
that some kid spok
Indonesian
No Indonesia
oh
Whats the name of the languag
Whats the word for tha
I dont
I dont know it was just Indonesian
th oh well the other one Hindi
No
Or Urdu Urdu
its Urdu
Urdu is is an Indian language
Urdu is an Indian languag
uhhuh
oh
yeah I have ya Anne Kit Panda
But like most of the upper class Indians he speaks English
yeah
British English
yeah
With a real slant to it
hm okay
But we kind of figured that between Leslie who speaks British English
mhm
High British English
mhm
and Carrie whos from Texas
and me
Between the three of us
when the kids get out of our class theyll be able to understand anything
Right That reminds me that you know I coteach with Pat
Pats from the east coast
No I dont think she has an accent
Once in a great while I can hear something but she
She and I speak very much alike very similar I think
pronouncing words
Id say youre from too
Well anyway l last year one of our students said
uh you and Gloria speak pronounce things differently
and Pat thought that was really sharp of her that she had that good of ear that she could
tell we pronounce things slightly different
yeah were always talking about words that we pronounce differently
But anyway the girl whos working with him shes said if you could send her some assorted information about emus
Definitely
Theyd be pleased to get anything youve got
Definitely better
because they they were sort of checking things out here a little bit about emu apparently theres no
um
commercial emu raising in the country this is one of the problems is this they cant th the problem is slaughtering them
No thats state was weird because I cant imagine it whatever place slaughters
Because thats the prob thats the p thats the problem here too in the United States is the slaughtering of them
ostriches I wa
yeah
eh the U S Dems Department of Agriculture Leary is setting up a lye affecting industry theyre interviewing pressure by government agencies
hm
I mean there are places but it seems it not so much its hard to do
But just like they needed to be classified as livestock first theyre going for human consumption
No but why wouldnt they be able to slaughter to get it with the ostriches if ostriches are being slaughtered
I would think they would well I can no I got all kinds of stuff I could mail her do so does she speak English too or
yeah you can mail English stuff I mean thats
okay yeah
yeah
Or you can just mail it to me and then Ill pass it on
okay I Ill definitely mai mail away my emu magazines as well
okay
yeah
and wha tell me whatever was the end with the electricity in your house
Pardo
What was the problem with the elec
oh it was a freak thing basically it vibrated
uh oh it was called a dead short
oh wire came loose on a main ground line inside and the whole system just shut down which is normal
Where was the wir
took them
up in the attic crawl space very hard to get to
Do you mean like maybe just even reverberations from the fan or something
Probably that what he thinks he just you know he just happened to happen to write down unrelated to current surge said its a very unusual thing to happen
mhm
Anyhow as it was there there was no fire hazard from it because they grounded it right out but you know no one
took him fore you know he did not find it then and then we came back took almost four hours to locate finally where it was
Wow wow
But anyway you replace that and a couple other circuits on it
uhhuh
and change a few things on the wiring too but as I said it was just a weird thing where it actually
disconnected very poorly put on it wasnt really fastened the proper way
yeah how much did you have to pay for it
A hundred and twenty which is very reasonable
mhm yeah
you spend I mean thats counting parts too thats way way below the normal rate
right yeah
then hes going to help me do a few things on the bottom the snow is like so steady and I could hardly see
oh yeah it sounds nice
It wasnt even on the forecast
mm
said a chance of flurries theres like an inch and half of flurries on the ground
oh oh is sh
and the flowers are still up which is really pretty Ill have to photograph it tomorrow
hm thats neat
Lets see what else I still appreciate what you did with the computer Im still learning stuff there
Well okay thats good
havent progressed too much her kids Abbys kids know it pretty well the older kids
reall
but they got right into games and stuff and where they were and how to bring them up I didnt know I had these games there
uhhuh
well they go right to the program right into it
yeah do you think they probably came installed with the
yeah
But they know I mean how to find and how to bring it up and the games theyve finished are like still there for them to continue working with
mhm mhm
but I have no idea how they do it and actually I dont care because I dont use them
Which of the kids are playing with it the the girls or the older boy
Two the two boys
uhhuh yeah
yeah
Have they come up more than a couple times to you alrea
oh about three time well the whole family I think twice together
and Abby stopped by a couple times with
one of the kids and friends of
Im blanking on his name
Avi
Avi Avis friends
He has a few Israeli friends in visiting
yeah
uhhuh
One of the guys I can r real pleasant guy Im fr I met him once in Israel I cant think of his name offhand very very pleasant
I dont know who els
yeah
Not Eli
oh maybe
Eli Sha is
uh is he t tallish
tall is I think a little bit graying already
yeah I think thats might be who it is
Theyre those cute
Because I know Eli lives in Boston now maybe is out there visiting Avi and they were b best friends
eh
I think thats who
I think thats who it was
Hes got a couple of kids I I dont know if hes with
yeah Im pretty sure because they were here here he was here was for like ten minutes passing through real quickly
eh so its possible he came to see Avi then
yeah
and lets see nothing else much I figure I better use up the phone call here you know before it runs out no
yeah
trying to think of what else
Im trying
My columns are progres I mail some of my columns again soon
uhhuh
Whats the postage by the way at Israe
What do you mea
Did it go u
I dont know thats the Americans would know
I had my first thing returned insufficient postage
Youre kidding
yeah a card to
uh Elon
hu
Maybe it was overweight
No I dont know it came b it came back two days ago I had the usual whatever I put on it
and Im puzzled unless the rates went up and I didnt know it
I dont know
You know or it gets screwed up and came back by mistake
I Im not sure
By the way we even have U P S now but thats probably expensive I dont know what it costs U P S overseas
Probably expensive yeah
yeah
Its funny this phone connection is not the greatest kindof a its space is a space between it
yeah and I hear a little bit of noises in the back
yeah
yeah
Maybe its just with storm I me probably its quite a quite a snow storm coming down
thats what I miss
oh its pretty
um h how are the chic are the chickens still giving lat
Theyre out walking yeah their layings well I was getting almost an egg a day for I have eight
eight eight hens I got rid of all the roosters but one
and now theyre laying about two weeks the slow the laying down I get maybe three eggs out of all of them every day which is fine
you know
ah three eggs a day tota
er
total
uhhuh
Ye if I put a light in to give them artificial light theyll pick way up
but until I get the wiring all done I dont want to do that
reall
mhm
Hows the hows the Aztec doin
uh
loves it first day out in the weather just was running around all playful like almost playful with the the dog and the goat will walk together now
oh reall
yeah theyll walk theyll walk side by side kind of ignoring each other but if either one stops the other one will wait
Thats funny
so they kind of enjoy each others company but dont really hang out and once in a while Aztec will butt Fritz which Fritz doesnt like trying to be playful
y
um
I forgot there was a while back when the week was starting to sh no we decided that she wants a labrador retriever or a golden retriever
She tried working on saw there was no
oh
Was no chance
thought maybe shed check with the next door neighbors didnt work and then she decided well in that case
then shes going to go to America live with Uncle Johnny
oh
and and either Fritz will die pretty soon if not shell kill Fritz
and then Johnny will buy a labrador retriever for her
and then hell buy her anything she possibly wants and also then shell find find a nice girl for him to marry
okay tell her maybe la
and Fritz
you know that if you find if y if you find Johnny a nice girl to marry then maybe Johnny wont be able to buy you anything you want anymore
Well tell h tell her were try to sell her actually the vet gives Fritz about a year
No hes healthy but hes at times hes just totally co Ive re I really think hes almost like th the equivalent of like dogs Alzheimers
Really
at times he seems real confused hes out walking he just stops looks around and like
Like what am I doing here you know and his hearing is not any is is very very bad his hearing got bad real quickly
Well its interesting that he and the goat are sort of you know
yeah oh its comical yeah you can tell her f yeah tell her Fritz will probably die real soon so she can come to America
okay
and then mom
Anyone
Anyone particular that you are seeing no

uh Im not sure if Abby wants to go to it but she is going to it theres
Cant remember his name but an Israeli official is in Bloomfield Township giving a political speech
uhhuh
and I guess they know who he is or know somebody about him so theyre going to it
yeah yeah
and
what else
everything else
are you si youre still working on your novel righ
oh yeah yes but its so actually I know I keep saying this because Ill be picking up alot more this winter once I get everything else done because than I
I spend so much time outside when its warm I dont want to be inside working
yeah yeah
oh yeah
And y you dont have any plans yet for coming

Well get like five thousand dollars back pay then Ill have some money to afford to go
uhhuh
0
yeah
I got a I made a copy of it theres a thing called Israel Sky Connection have you heard of the
Israel Sky Connectio
Connection
Its exp you pay like two thousand bucks for a vacation which includes like
No
It looks like a paramilitary training thing for the public
oh oh oh oh I think I heard something like that
yeah I might mail a copy of the letter to its kind of pretty interesting its all through Israel
I think I read about that someplace
Defensive driving firing weapons on the run you know s repelling off cliffs you know
I I yeah I think someplace I saw an article for that maybe even the Jerusalem report or something like that
You know its kindof an intriguing thing yeah
yeah
yeah I thought it was something youd like
and
No lets see what els
trying to think of what else is going on
m
Im sorry I was going to practice my Hebrew I cant do that on the phone because this phone call
were maybe go tomorrow were probably going to be going to the area near Carmel theres an
Having a olive s olive picking olive s some sort kindof an olive festival in a a bunch of Arab villages there
and a couple of small Jewish villages
Where I guess its the end of the olive picking time and theres supposed to be tours of these
places where they make the olive oil and it sounds like it could be pretty interesting and maybe some folklore type music and stuff also
yeah thatll be nice I
and we had ordered a car a while back we thought we were going to visit Dave and Zvir this weekend
mhm
but then it fell through because Abe and Dorothy are go coming there for the weekend
Hows is u Abe doing a letter better or
Well I havent seen him yet because each time Ive tri like twice I think Ive tried to get down there and each time sort of Dorothy kind of well you know and you know
I guess shes hesitant about people coming to visit
mhm
Though Miriam did se was there saw them for a couple hours she was in Jerusalem
and she said you can see its not always the same because
sometim she was talking to him
and he was going over a map and pointing things out to her
Which to her seemed like they were totally off
and a little while later he was talking and all the instructions were fine
mhm
He just speech is a little bit slurred but you can sti you know you can understand him
Which is better feeling its probably how its going to stay the you know I dont way Im just yo its getting better but
yeah
Im sure hes never going to drive again or anything like that even though they wont admit it yet
said good morning honey and Im g I Im going to hit her you know
I think maybe Ive got a problem here
uhhuh
So
uh Ive been trying to
act a little better and I so I I have been acting a little better
No
uhhuh
Its amazing how resentful I am of her when she wants me to do something I was like you know and then I usually do it but
But eh she doesnt really ask for much she really doesnt
And I could certainly be alot nicer and still not
break my
back at over anything
mhm
So thats been improving my p my attitude has been improving there
And then
this thing with
you know with Jerry hes
its just its its its
its over
I mean its r its really over
W
we can still go out
Im not looking for anybody else and Im not looking
to get him out of my life and
Id still like to see him but
Id I dont ever want to live with him again and I I dont ever want to be
involved in his
this
finan this insanity this you know hes just
oh I want to have a house like that and Im going to do this and Im going to do that and
mhm
I want to have this and I want to buy a new Dodge pickup next year and
da da da da da and all these things he wants to do the big plans
And yet he r he refuses to go to work
mhm
hes just
thats
so weird
Just its just nuts
And one of my friends is
and I was reading this thing I think it was Newman or
Robert Johnson they talk about the
peur P E U R
The peur yeah that sounds like it
You said Peter Pan in your letter
peur
yeah well
yeah
um
And one of my friends is into the Jungian thing
She says that that comes from having a
a consuming
mother
mhm
And I guess she was I dont know
She looks
doesnt look
she looks alright but
but that this is just you know hes fifty six years old and thats Jerry
So
all at once
in the last day or two
Ive
jus Ive just sort of realized Im ready for some stability
hm
And I thought oh what a concept
i I havent really
been in a market for it
up until now
um
and I I wouldnt know
how to go about getting it either
Its just that hey I think Im ready for it j jus
oh
m
Interesting
yeah that sort of hit me too when I
I told you about
realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable and I dont enjoy it that much anymore
Its okay but
thats why I think I Im going to go back to school
Youre ready for stability to
yeah I mean I want to have
a profession that I can use
you know and get a job
and have a practice and
that I would enjoy more
And
you know and I think about marrying Eve and
if I wanted to I could just be a housewife
And f hes going to make alotof money and everything but
that doesnt make me feel too comfortable
mhm
You know so
you know I want to go back to school and know that I can support myself
I tell you its nice though
to have a man who would allow you that option
mhm
There are men out there who will not
be happy until youre learning you know youre if they dont if you know if
you know what Im trying to say
yeah yeah
um yeah
So I think thats neat
But yeah I understand what youre saying its
yeah
You need something for yourself
Right and its not just a matter of money but having my own life
too
yeah
But one thing I was going to ask you about was
like you were getting all excited about doing
financial planning and learning that
mhm
Have you thought about going to school and doing tha
Well I havent gotten too far on that I
took a little three session course at the local you know
m adult school on financial planning and e e a financial planner did the class and
I says how did you get to be that and he says well he took a class
He says basically he says eh theres a whole outfit in Denver where you can take a correspondence course and be one
But he got a
an undergraduate degree in finance
mhm
And I thought hm
well that sounds interesting
I dont know if I want to go that far
but
Im just pointing in the direction of learning more about money
And Ive got a net worth statement now and its
Im surp Im just is
Im just surprised to learn that my net worth is increasing every month you know because e when I count the stuff up that
like theres eight hundred and ten dollars every month
increased equity in the
huh
the building
Wow
yeah and a few years ago it was only two hundred a month a
and
and theres that
And then Im you know saving money through my retirement see I dont have any
income at the disposable income much
now but
Theres future stuff if thing you know if
mhm
so I can
manage to get the m equity out of the building without giving it all to
taxes
yeah
thats where thats going to be a big problem
So
Im just trying to learn about money
uhhuh
And and its its not that hard
I still dont know about
price expense ratios and st some of the stuff just doesnt compute like
you should buy bonds when interest rates are
coming down
But not always and
You know I dont know why is that And e you know Ive had it explained numerous times but I still dont
quite get it
But
hm
I will
And you know it just just life seems to be all about mastery right now just
Learning computers and riding a bicycle and worrying about money and stuff
mhm hm
So
um I e I feel pretty good
This thing with Jerry m it was made me upset
I was I guess mostly I was j
beating myself up over it
Well heres another relationship
But you know I never did take him seriously as a
marriage partner after the first month or two
And
But
I was comfortable and I enjoyed being with him for the most part
Although the circumstances have changed now
He just
hes standing on a shrinking iceberg talking about his big plans you know
Hes probably going to end up living with his mother Like me but
mhm
you know d raggedyassed and
So does he like you say its over but does he know tha
oh
Have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that youre just going to always be ther
We can go out you know it was
e
indefinitely as far as Im concerned
But I have no plans to be with him for the future
I dont have any plans not to be with him either
But
I dont know if hes going to get bummed out by this
mhm
Or he s said the other day in when he was in a kindof a crappy mood he says he wants all or nothing in a relationship
oh
Well thats a strong statement
And if he
if he presses it then I guess Ill have to say itll be nothing
uhuh
mm
And I have never been
terribly involved in his financial problems
But
I find I do things that Im going to try stopping
Like I
Im afraid of being alone
And so I asked him if he wanted to go to this Aid banquet and I I
told him Id buy us tickets
You know now really he ought to buy his own damn tickets
mhm
And theres no reason why I should buy it
But I just wanted to make sure hed go
mhm
So Im going to stop doing stuff like that
And if he
doesnt want to go then Ill go with somebody else
well thats the thing the thing about being alone
I mean it is hard
It is hard Ive been alone alot
yeah
And I I kept meeting these men that
I mean I was really wanting to meet somebody and
I kept meeting these men and then
trying them out and then it didnt work out
You know Id like hope Id keep hoping
And I got pretty good at ending the r these things after about three months And I just kept
mm
meeting people just ending them
And yes its its hard its hard
But like I enjoy being alone too though
yeah I guess
yeah well
It got less scary after a while
yeah well I am going to have to
come to terms with that
Because I have basically had a man in my life for the past past thirty five years
I f f figure that in July nineteen ninety one I was alone for three weeks
A and up till Ive always had some man around
mhm
And
maybe its time to give that a look
yeah because
I dont know I I
I really started to enjoy
not
needing somebody
mhm
And
I felt really good
Not meeting somebod
Not needing somebody
Needing somebody
yeah
yeah
And like e e I could just turn my attention to other things
w
Well some of my friends are telling me that I dont need a man
And I I know that
But on some level I dont
yeah
mm yeah its a real internal thing
yeah
So anyway
um Jerry is around
And you know like Im
I was using my mothers recliner here
Im sitting in it right now
I cant get the damn foot rest
down so Im probably going to have to call him up to get him to come and
get it down for me if I dont want to break the damn thing
You know stuff like that its nice to have a its nice to have a man around
well maybe you could look underneath it and see if you could fix
yeah I dont know how the hell
Did you loo
I looked
yeah Im kind of looking at the cheap plastic thing and
hm
yeah just turn it over But
So it sounds like one of the joints is not working
Well I dont know I just moved it out pretty far
oh
uhhuh
And oh theres a thing on the side
oh hey I just
Well
Theres that handle I forgot about
oh
Shit
Now you dont have to call him to fix it
yeah
Now I dont have to call him Thats nice
mhm
Except the back is up too hi too low
Well grandma can fix that
okay
yeah
oh there its back and
oh I dont know how to fix that
I bet she knows how to do that
So
hm
oh there it goes
Alright Now back in business whew
Thats thats always exhilarating when you can do something yourself
yeah yeah well
Eve and I got into this
big thing because
0
the house has been a mess and then h
then the house has been really a mess and then then he spent like hours putting up these shelves and I I was getting really pissed off because I was doing most of the cleaning
So I I started getting in this argument with him
And he got mad because hes been working on the shelves
And I cant do the shelves
I dont know how to do the shelves
And so we finally agreed that
he would teach me how to do these things
So tell me I mean it was shocking for us and we just heard it
You know the night it happened on the news it was a little blip and Paul and I were watching T V and we just
looked at each other with our mouths open
uhhuh
Im sure
You know so
well you know what was really it was really kind of weird
um
I mean when I heard he got shot I I wasnt really surprised
mhm
But then when I heard he was dead I was really surprised
yea
You know because I thought okay so if he was shot you know hell be okay like Reagan when he was shot he was okay
but you know then it was like really not long after I heard that he was shot that I heard that he was dead it was kind of strange
mhm
So it was a very you know its been a weird few days then we had
a day where everybody could go to the Knesset and and see we werent going to see anything because it was a closed coffin
But alotof a about a million people went to the Knesset to walk by the the casket
mhm
And
Did you guys go
Bill went I didnt go he had to go at four in the morning and wait four hours
Bill went
ohmygosh
yeah that was just a bit too much for me
Just to get in line
yeah he had to stand in line almost four hours
jeez
yeah so it was too much for me youknow but
uh yeah then the next day when all the we had like eighty five presidents and kings and queens and
what do you call it foreign ministers and this country and that country who came for the funeral that was really kind of
I guess youd say moving
yeah it is and there were you know I heard all the speeches god N P R here has just been
Just thats the only story you know
mhm really
all day
hm
I hear Linda about twenty times a day
Really you know its so funny Ive known Linda for like four years and Ive never heard her on the radio
yeah
Ill have to go back to the states
oh youll hear her youll hear her every day if you come back here
uhhuh
Itll be like
mhm

So we have to
together
for for everybody because you
Now when did you get marrie
We got married September first
Well we just went to the courthouse
And we had we got married by a traffic cop
It was really funny

uhhuh
mhm
And it was it was sweet it was a beautiful day and he took us outside and under a tree and
hm
It was romantic we went out to dinner
mhm
Did any of your family com
uhuh
Nobody was there
hm
Nobod
No
Did you want anybody to go
Well eh we did it
We decided to do it that morning we had decided we would get married and we went and got our certificates and all that stuff
But we were both home on that Friday I was home from work and he was too and we said well lets just go get married now and he said okay
mhm
So we did
We were both in our jeans and it was really funny
ohmygod

he got his card to work he got his social security card that lets him work
so he has an honest job now
mhm

And the person said that the I N S doesnt go for that
mhm
That they want to see a wedding and a reception and a whole you know thing otherwise they think youre just
yeah
getting married so the person can work or whatever
Right
Well
Weve Ive thought about that and and I cant imagine
They may have questions because of that
But we have photographs of us in Israel and we have letters we wrote to each other
mhm
mhm
You know which is wha which is what they require to prove that you actually knew each other before
uhhuh
And we just explain that we dont have were paying for the wedding and we dont have the money right now

mhm mhm
So I I really dont foresee much trouble because we have
uhhuh

You know we
mhm
If they interview anybody they they will find out the truth which is that
we got married

Well it was June before wasnt i
It was supposed to be July actually the beginning of July and then my sister got engaged

It was really strange I saw them walking down the street and it was like I was confused you know I didnt know where I was for a second
uhhuh
I thought ohmygod thats Yona I could tell by the way she walked
uhhuh
and Esther looks really good shes not as
uhhuh
little ugly thing anymore
I revised my opinion
uhhuh no shes much cuter even Yona and Mordechai admit that shes cuter than she was before
yeah
yeah
ohgod we have to
Lizzy
yeah well he like called me this first or second night I was here or something
yeah
He sounded like such a jerk on the phone and I didnt understand why
He sounded like that for a while you know
yeah
And so I was really really upset because when I first got here I was really excited about him coming and about people coming and seeing me and blah blah blah
mhm
And I was just like so I was talking to him like David whats going on why do you sound like so s s su such a stranger on the phone you know
uhhuh
and like you know if youre not happy with
our relationship then we have to talk about it and like decide something because I feel like horrible
mhm
So
He
so he like
Hes like well
I didnt want to tell you this this happened a little while ago whatever and hes like I cheated on you
ohmygod
And of course like I just couldnt believe it and I was just like wha
Right
It was like totally out of the blue itd happened like a month ago
ah
And
When you were still in in the United States
In New Jersey
Over the summer the
Yes it was early in
it was when I got home from Shelter Island
And he called like out of total desperation saying like he had to move hes living with some psycho woman
Right right I remember that
yeah and then I didnt hear from him for like a whole week
Right
Which is completely unlike him
yea
So he cheated with me cheated on me right after he got off the phone with me like around that time
With the psycho woman or with wh
No no no no no not with the psycho woman
With this woman like he had been living with three two guys and a g woman
yea
in his old apartment
yea
And
the woman was one of the guys boyfrie girlfriends
Right I remember that
yeah and so he cheated with her
ohmygod
yeah so he told me how like
at that time
when he left
the house he had helped her move into her new place
yeah
And she helped him move out of the house
yeah
and
He said he was feeling really crappy and like I know I had written him a letter saying that like you know I should see other people and blah blah blah
Right
And so he was really upset about everything at that point
And then she like told him
that she really really liked him alot and she really you know had feelings for him and
ohgod
And then they had sex and Im just like well
I was like pretty upset
oh I Im sure
0
yeah like ah I just really devastated me for like
That is so unexpected it totally devastated me I couldnt believe it I mean I I cant I mean like
yeah
especially to tell you this when youre you know fairly new in such a strange place and
yeah
Probably going through alotof shit anyways
oh yeah when I first got here it was a big party like my
what happened i the supervisor turned out to be a real
real jerk
Being paid great and
And theres nothing in the apartment when I got here and I
yeah
Everything in here already
And I like just went through major culture shock
Right
So
I dont know lots of things have happened and I
was trying to look on the bright side when I was writing the letter
Right
Because I mean I am happy here like Im really happy with stuff Ive
been dating alot since then and like got my life together and
yeah
Cool
And my job is really easy and Im
You know
hey Ive so much to learn here so thats exciting so Im not bored and I just like
Right
Thats cool
Dont sleep enough it gives you all because Im too excited about everything there is to do and
yeah
This new apartment problem if I could just
Move into a new apartment then Id be all set
So
oh what ultimately happened with that thing did I mean
oh yeah
it sounded like you stayed together for a while or something
um
yeah we did like okay
Well I was completely and totally just horrified and like
uhhuh
Like crying for a while on the phone
Like I just couldnt belie I couldnt it was so bad because Moss it was like
I completely
Trusted him
Trusted him like
yep its like ev
No no no but like its so bad because its like
His like that when hes broke that trust right
Right
He broke it in all people
hm
Like not just in guys
yeah
You know what I mean like for seriously for a week I just hated everybody
yeah
And it was so bad because it was right when I got here
So it was like I didnt want to meet anybody new I couldnt like I was so devastated I was crying like constantly you know
yeah
And it was just like I couldnt trust anybody because
You know if you decide to trust somebody so much
you just comple completely never think that they could do that to you
Right
Right
And then they do
Right
Its just like
I totally know how that feels
yeah so
I guess they grow up
Like why should you trust anyone
yeah and I guess I grew up alot from that too though
Yea
And I dont mean that in a cynical way because like
I totally believe that you have to keep trusting people now
Like for a while I was really angry but
yeah
Now Im like you know you just have keep trusting people and
they screw up theyre human and things like that might keep happening or whatever but
I dont know if you can I dont know
if I could ever trust anyone and I dont know if you feel if youve ever
Not like that though
Not like that
I dont think I ever will trust anybody like that again
Not like
Not like the number of times Ive heard a woman say I know you would never do that I know him
He would never do that I swear you said it I swear I said it Ive
oh I said it
Filthy women say it
oh I totally said it
And it happens from now on its just like
Well you know I trust him I I mean I would I hope
But he could
Whod never do
something like that but it might happen I I I could never s see myself ever being that
yeah
naive again
mhm thats what it is
And I think thats
but
Probably healthier and good but its also kind of
It is
Bad its like you lost your innocence or something and why do people have to do that
Yes
to you I mean if you could just live your whole life in this happy love trust
faithful kind of thing imagine the kind of person you would be this young romantic fool passionate and like
just crazy and
mm
Not embittered by the co coldhearted world
It gets robbed from you though like
yeah
And I mean I dont want to say that we trusted the wrong people because
yeah
I mean I really believe that David is a good person
Right
And like
At first I like when he first told me I was just like David you know I will always love you whatever but I Im going to go now and you made your decision and
Right
There is nothing else to talk about so
Well I think in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing that
You kno
oh yeah hes totally like unhappy by
what was going on because he basically he wanted to be together
Right
He wanted like he needed a sexual relationship
yeah
And he needed me to be there and he needed to like someone nurturing and all that crap and I just wasnt doing it and I know that
Right
Right
Like I was really hard on him I was always telling him that we werent like working out I was always saying I didnt want to be with him I mean
And so like
He did me the biggest favor though and thats why like I got over him really quickly its kind of funny
Reall
Bec yeah because
like at first it was really devastating
Right
Like it was so weird because the difference between Josh and him like Josh was devastating for a long time for me
Right
Even though he wasnt as nearly
As like I never had as m many as deep feelings for him
Right
And it never like was as serious in many ways
mhm
But with David it was like I think because I had been in pain for so long with like
yeah
problems with my parents and problems with him and all this pressure
yeah
That by the time he finally cheated on me I just realized
Well at first I didnt because I I had to okay interesting so I told him goodbye and then
he called me again like a day later or two and we talked things over and then he called me again we talked things over and so I decided that I could forgive him
mhm
mm
Right
And we could still be going out because I still loved him and I could understand
How it happened because of the situation
mhm
But I I told him I still thought it was still shitty and horrible and whatever
mhm
but that I could forgive him
but it would take a long time to trust him
God Liz thats so rational of you I cant believe you
No no no but it was though and I really did like forgive him
mhm
It was like you know I thought
about the whole thing and Im d and besides many times I had thought about cheating too because I like
I just couldnt understand that part of him really well you know and
At the time when he called me I wasnt there for him and he really needed to talk to me and I sa I was really cold I was like listen my parents are here I cant talk to you bye
You know
Wow
so
then
I had forgiven him but it still like just hurt it wasnt the same anymore you know
Right
And hes so far away and there are other people here that were interesting to me and
I didnt
Want him to come live with me
mhm
I didnt want it and
And he wanted that
yeah and I had felt alotof pressure and I didnt want to promise him Id come live with him when I after a year
Right
And so finally we had another conversation a while ago and
And it was actually a while ago it was in September or something in early September and I was just like
yeah
you know we really need to talk and I think its really over and blah blah blah and hes just like he was less
Like I was more like its over and hes less like its okay you know
mhm
But hes like okay
And then
So that was it
Were over and then I hadnt talked to him for weeks and weeks and I had a really bad cold and I was sick and then he called me up again ah
uhhuh
This is the worst that he had dr been drinking a little bit
yeah
and so he was just like I really miss you I really want to get back together and blah blah blah
yeah
And I was just like no I like you know I he made me start crying though because he started like reminiscing I hate when they do that or whatever
they
yeah so I started crying a bit and I had been sick and like on medicine all week so I
yeah
You know its just like youre depressed anyway
mhm
And so
And so hes just like lets get you know back together and I want to see you and all this stuff and Im just like
And then I like at the end of the conversation I got myself together and like no you know
I like where Im going hes like well where are you going Im like I dont know but I like that
mhm
And Im just like you know and
I cant promise to see you again or whatever because then its just like
you know then wha
Its all been I cant explain it but you know it just
Its not right because all the pressure feelings started coming back and everything
Right
mhm
So and hes just and Im like listen you know you never know we might get back together way in the future but I just cant think about that now I want to be free and all this stuff so
Then I just got a letter from him
oh great
and hes like
You know I really miss you still and blah blah blah and hes like by the way this big phone bill can you help me pay it
No way
yeah and
Forget that
Wha
Forget that
Well no no no the thing is though is like I would help him pay it because
yeah
Right
But he said hes glad that he did it because otherwise no one wouldve ever have known
Well
So
Well Ill say
Im glad too because you know I was having all that pain and I didnt know why
Right well daddy says hi and to tell you that he wants you to get to feeling better too and he loves you
oh thanks
thankyou
Tell him that I love him too
He loves you too
okay
Well bless your heart well
Well
You dont be up doing nothing you l

No
And uh
So I was waiting till today and then I was going to call you by in the morning if they hadnt of came in today
But thats good though I mean at least this you way you know what happened and
yeah
You know if you wouldve called before the surgery you wouldnt have known
Right well thats true
You knows
I was just hoping you was home and what is it about twenty to eleven ther
Its eleven oclock
Eleve
Well I mean Toon sets his clock fast so its like ten till
Right
Right well see its twenty till four here
okay
And
Daddy
I was going to come home on the fifteenth Toon and I talked about it and I said Im going home on the fifteen and I had wrapped all of you alls gifts because Ive got stuff that I was bringing back home to you all
uhhuh
I wrapped it all and and Toon said youre going home I said yeah
And then I talked to my form came in saying that I could have my surgery
It was approved
Right
And I called Doctor Gonte I said Doctor Gonte it came in when do you want to do it and he wanted to do it right after I just got my period so I just got my period November the eighth and I
uhhuh
thought just just eh two days ago
Right
And he was like were doing it on Friday I was like eh
Doggone it I cant go home then
But I mean thats better anyway because
yeah
You know Christmas I can go ahead and spend here and then January Toon is taking leave and were going to fly home
Well good youll all
Even if
Youll all be together and it wont be such a long little flight for you that way
Right and even if
Youll have help with Darrin
Right and even if Toon doesnt get leave Im still coming home and he said thats fine
okay well good
So Ive already planned it
yeah
But the budget still hasnt passed and they said that if it doesnt pass by December first we wont be getting paid so
You wont be getting paid for wha
for Toons job because hes the federal government
yeah
But see they had paid us on the fifteenth because our paychecks at first everyone said we wasnt going to get paid
Well by God they better take care of the army boys
But then they said that itd already been aligned so they paid us on the fifteenth and now theyre saying if it doesnt pass in two weeks that were not going to get paid
oh
So its going to bite because its going to be right at Christmas and so its going to really bite
Right
You know so hopefully they you know d find out something to do
Well I hope so I tell you Clinton sure got it in a mess
So are you all oka
oh yeah were doing fine
Daddy has been down in his back bless his heart and
eh
And uh
So youve been working
I been working my right arm is still giving me fits on the bottom side
uhhuh
And I had went back to Livingston he was he set me up to do the surgery and they got ahold of workers compensation and they would not approve it
Reall
yeah
They said being as I had already went to my attorneys doctor
And got a rating
uhhuh
that they would not approve it
uhhuh
So I switched attorneys
and
I dont know if shell remember who you are or not so
well s sh hopefully she knows you
yeah
R she knows you thats f
mmhm
yeah
and then I mean you can whatever if shes interested she can come over and
you guys or whatever
Right yeah
um
I mean I assume being as already he said he found a place and it sounds like
hes already committed to he said that hes going to move in there so
y
I dont want to tell him something now and have him
says something different to the people hes gi giving a commitment to now
Well I mean hes under no obligation if you tell him like well actually this girl bagged
you know
Well it was more I thought that just whether you were comfortable with him
than it was wi whether whether or not we had somebody to move in but
yeah I mean that was the original issue
right
But Im I guess what Im trying to say is that I
Youd be willing to give it a chance
at this point I feel like I dont have any rightful that I kind of used up my
yeah
whatever
yeah
well I hope you dont feel like you were I dont know like ah forced into any you know decisions out of your own ah you know feelings I mean
well I mean Im not really sure what that means but
Well I mean I hope you werent you know you know your mind wasnt like made up for you you know
It was in a little bit to a certain extent yeah
because
you know and its nobodys fault really its just bad really
abysmal timing
you know
Well yeah
and
I
whatever I mean
I guess you could say shit happens
yeah okay
It does
but I mean
its really frustrating here because I have no control over it too you know
so its like
yeah well it makes it equally
and then t
hard to have any decisions done
to think that whatever that it had been all wrapped up and everything was solved and then to have
you know to get this email from Sarah like oh Im so happy Im moving back in there
right she she clearly didnt see that it was important
like you know you had a commitment
show you the place
Well she did though because later she was like oh Im really sorry I hope I didnt mess things up for you
and that was like well
oh
In fact you did but
I mean
yeah I mean we may not have somebody renting it right away thats
well
I mean
I guess I can ask my parents for money
make up for
well
for it s
my fault
I I I feel a little a little
tough asking Brian to
split you know during the time
I mean right now hes splitting it while
while you were gone
you know were splitting it Ming
yeah
I mean I Im full of like really
like myself
bad feelings about the whole thing I feel like I screwed you guys over by moving in with you
basically
Well I think
because I mean you know these fellowships Im applying for almost all of them require that I live abroad
you had it pretty much
you know
yeah
and I knew that
I think I was just massively in denial
last summer
yeah we
but I mean thats something that you and I have to talk about too
yeah
on just
not even on the housing level but on the
yeah obviously on the whole different situation
you know wha what are we going to do next year if I
go back to France for another year
yeah
right
because I dont know if I could
handle another
I mean
four months is
a pretty long time
bad enough
you know
yeah
I dont know
and what wed have to
last looked its kind of going kind of slow
yeah
yeah
you getting alot don
um yeah I feel like Ive accomplished a fair amount
thats good
and then well sort of have to
fall into place in the Spring
Right you have to see just
you know digesting
Right right
I made a really bad mistake not bringing a computer here
if really f
You cant get on to any computers or
Well I can use Sarahs but I mean obviously she needs to use it too and
the thing is to have a Powerbook or a really small computer you can take to the library with you so that you can take your notes right on to the computer
yeah
sure yeah
Its so much faster
yeah
so you
and like
did you take them long hand and then
yeah
enter them in later
yeah huge waste of time
yeah
well
They didnt have any snow on the ground but boy it was eh
Its cold here
It was cold it was frosty the
but it was like forty four degrees so that
yeah
yeah but its just that its just that clear cold thats the way it is been here its just been cold
real crispy
yeah thats it yeah
yeah this guy up in Paris hes going well I moved up here for snow no snow yet thankyou and I said well just wait itll come
This way youll have your share
Well
Were got one year to go
and were going to try for Germany
If Germany doesnt happen were going to try for Beal
Possibly Nollis Peterson
which is in Colorado
ooh Colorado would be neat
Nicord which in Washington
oh that would be neat
and then
If none of those pan out then were going to have like Right Paddle High Oaks because its a nice base
ooh that would be cool
yeah so
we may go over to the other side
oh Colorado youd love it you like to ski
yeah right Pats pretty nice too man they got ninety acres of hunting land ei out on the base
Where wheres that at
Its in Ohio so thats quite a ways there
ooh that would be neat Ive never been there
yeah but Id be below Mavericks sister
so shed be able to go visit her alot
yeah yeah she could go visit them quite often
well
Well that would be cool
but were going to try for all the you know yeah thatll be like the sixth choice well go down well probably else fourth
yeah
yeah
I should get Germany though but if neither way well be coming home
Well I watched that movie
Only You last night
yeah
and the they were over in Italy and that was looking real exciting to me and I was going oh look
tell Roy okay Roy thats where Im going next
yeah thats it
Guess what movie we watched tonight and it does look like
that place we were at
Wha
Rob Roy
yeah we watched it tonight
eh di did you think he was dumb or was that just my perception
I dont know he he couldve saved a whole lot of frigging problems if he just called that guy a whatchamacallit but then again
O or well if he just went over to that high lord and said so and so wants me to call you this and
and now hes after me because I wont
yeah there there he shouldve done that he did tha he shouldve done that
But yeah
But because to trust that that first lord that guy was uh was
Hes too back stabbing he might of called that guy a mega whatever
But
oh or whatever the heck youre supposed to call him and that guy might o
Jacabout Jacobite
Yes
yeah Jacobite and then they got him on the turn around and got him anyway and then he we have nobody to turn to
So I can understand why he didnt do that
but yeah
He should of went over to the first lord instead of the getting his wife raped and his friends murdered and his house burnt down
pretty goddamn stupid
yeah he shouldve went over there and talked to him well at least after he got his damn house burned his wife he couldve save his friends by gosh and went over there and talked to him
yeah you know when he saw things were going down I mean like telling hes like oh dont worry about it their fight isnt with you bologna
With their dog either look what happened to him
I know well its really sad
So but you know on his grave it didnt show another baby so that baby must not
yeah
that mustve been something they wrote into the movie
yeah because what well I dont know I dont remember there was two sons right
yeah they had two sons and they didnt show any other baby
yeah so thats weird
So
So u unless since it
I remember
wasnt his error but it still should have been buried around her some place
oh maybe who knows what happened to it maybe it got kicked out or whatever thats another movie there
yeah I dont know what happened to it maybe it maybe the with all the stress and everything she di
she didnt have it
maybe she miscarried or something so
yeah couldve been
what when hes he was talking that smack to him and you just knew ooh
oh yeah
oh when he chomped over and bit him in the neck I was like yeah
Alright
I wouldve done something man I was like whoa
thats terrible
yeah
that that guy was messed up he sure played being a doofus good though didnt he that little short shit
yeah he did
that he acted li I was wondering about him and
He acted like a queer
yeah I was wondering about him in real life
because he certainly acts the part
yeah
proun putting around there the first time when that guy got real mad at him because he
yeah
pronouncing around bowing to everybody and he just wanted to do a little
yeah thats it
so
Well I think Rob Roy was acting really
Well I dont know he got cut up pretty bad but I think he knew he couldnt beat him unless he acted l really got the guy overconfident
yeah so
Because he was showing his ribs hurting and everything
Well and he was hurting pretty darn bad you know he was taking a good beating
he got the shit knocked out of him
so
yeah
Im real glad you picked that dude hu
Guess whos still surviving
hu
Guess whos still surviving
Grandpa Fred
Well I hope so but the bird
oh
Yes shes still hanging on she cant breathe were going to chan change her name to huffer and puffer but
stupid bird
yeah she flies a little ways and its like you can see clear down her throat because she cant shes gasping for air but she
All kinds of telephone calls
Of course none of them were Garret
mhm ha
Im fine I mean Im just getting more and more as I would answer the phone and it would not be Garret I would
oh hi you know
oh
and poor Staff Sergeant Ingram was the last one who called
and I said oh hi and then I said oh Im so sorry I just you know
uhhuh
I just was really hoping it would be Garret and its not and
mhm
And
hes when I told him Memphis Tennessee he said oh good
mhm
hed sigh
uhhuh
So I guess you know I didnt think about Bosnia or anything awful like that so I guess
yeah well thats what I thought of
Im like
and also what I didnt know was that Garrett wanted to be in the infantry and he didnt get to be so yeah
mhm
yeah
Im glad he didnt get what he wanted
mm
So hes w and sergeant Ingram supposed that since hes going to Memphis that that means hell be working on
air ele some kind of electronics parts to airplanes
Electronic parts to airplane
oh
uhhuh
uhhuh oh
So that will be nice
mhm
I guess I mean you know its something that hell still be able to do when he gets out
uhhuh yeah
Not like learning how to oil oil tank
things Really thats what Lawrence and one of his friends thats what he did when he was in the service
because he just you know the eh the
you know how the tops of the tanks have those kind of ball bearing things
mhm
He just made sure that those ran right
uhhuh and yeah and that kind of
puts him out of business once you get out in the civilian field
yeah so aren there isnt so much of a call for ball bearing tank ball bearing
uhhuh So
um lubricators
uh So do you have an address for hi
No
Not ye
Hes not gone yet
Hes graduating on Wednesday and then hes going to Margarets

um
oh okay he he graduates on Wednesda
mhm
and then hell be at Margarets for Thanksgivin
Or will he be on base for Thanksgiving
I think hell be at Margarets
That will be nice
uhhuh yeah
oh I think Im going to go up to
mom and dads which I dont kno I feel mean that I did
Wh
well because dad is always hinting that he but I just I dont want to make a great big dinner and all that stuff
uhhuh
thats it thats really I dont know
I just dont feel like it
mhm
But
Well if its just the three four of you that wouldnt you know
yeah
Now this has really been a good a week an
last eh let me see it started out with the coffee pot and it went onthefritz
and there was no way to fix it so they bought a new one
then the vacuum cleaner
was acting crazy and Lou fixed it
and then my stove was going to make cornbread yet
Your stove
ooh
and I opened it okay I had it preheating and I opened it up and there was this great big white ball inside and I go
Lou my stove is on fire
So he came out and he threw some salt on it and it kept
just this white ball of fire
I mean it didnt have any flames or anything it was just white ball
and we finally shut it off
And today Mary and I went to Spokane and got a new element for it
and I brought it home and we stuck it in and
turned it on and it went Boop
oh no
So I guess that when we had the big ball of white fire it did something with the switch
and I dont know if we blew the new element in the bottom or not
oh darn
and Thanksgiving is only two days away
Well youll have to eat at Marys
oh well I I told her that
Have you already invited a whole ton of people over I suppos
no she shes going to bring the pies
mhm
But she said that you know she could bake the the turkey there but I havent told her that our new element isnt working yet
oh
oh
so well see
hm
oh brother
I put some high octane car ah gas in Simon and he seems to be running with more exuberance so
and hes not saying fu funny things like youre right rear door is
No
Right rear passenger door is ajar
yeah
No
it except that the the breaks sound kind of So it seems like everything is falling apart
Darn wel
so okay did you get your boo
Yes I did
thankyou and I wro I started writing you a letter in Spanish
In Spanis
oh you dirty rotten rat
Dont you do that to me
I cant read Spanish
mhm
Well I mean just so some
Not the whole letter in Spanish
oh okay
Just some of it and then I misplaced the letter so
uhhuh
But theres a whole bunch of other
mhm
Well now its its Thanksgiving vacation so all I have to worry about is just wo you know just my eight hours of work and I
mhm
and Ive been going right home after work
Well actually I havent been
Ive gotten readdicted to this horrible game called Tetris
Which is oh its this kind of geometric shapes
They fit together
uhhuh
And so I
goodness Friday I wasted an hour and a half
I stayed after work for an hour and a half playing it and today I
stayed after work for an for half an hour
uhhuh
Just playing that stupid game
I cant believe it
Ive just Im going to ask
if they can please take it off of the computer because I just
think about it all the time
hm
I i
what did is it actually a waste of time or
oh yes definitely
Its not helping anything or anybody
Unless I dont know
I might be able to fool myself into thinking that it would
help me out with spatial relationships
or something but I dont think it really does
oh
hm
It would be just like saying that playing Super Mario Brothers sharpens your reflexes
Well yeah
You know
uh well Im surprised that you didnt think about
Garretts being state side you know I
had visions of oh going half way across the country like Emily
oh I dont
da
see I just dont
I think I just want too much Ike wanted him
ah he when he called the last time he said
So I might get to go to Fort Louis or e or Mountain Home
or mom even Fairchild
I thought oh
oh
Because thats what I was
I was counting on Fairchild
Thats what you were hoping
yeah
oh
So
To me Memphis seems like a long ways away
Well
Have you heard from Em since she went bac
yeah
She sent me a a letter that said dear Mom
thankyou so much for everything love Emily uh
And that was it
oh
Which was nice
I mean its more than Ive sent her
uhhuh
But still it kind of was
yeah
see I just want too much
No No yo you know yo she could have said you know that
um she had a good flight over and she met some new
friends or she could have made it a little bit y
longer than that
yeah
But you did get a letter from her so
yeah and I mean you have a nice long letter if I could if I if
if I could ever locate it
uhhuh
Well I cant eh I cant really believe this good fortune that you you know
yeah thats but a half an hou hour
Thats a long time
um a half an hou a half an hou
Isnt it
like but Ive been but Ive been worrying to myself thinking
well Im not really worrying Ive been trying to think of some way to scam thinking
well now I could call back and say I was Constance and then Ill call back and say Im Madeline that was so
uhhuh
ah
No way
You can call anywhere in the world though so I was thinking about calling Emily but then I wasnt sure what if that was her right number or not and
mhm
This time I wanted to talk to you
oh well
oh My mom
But that would have been nice if you could have talked talked to Em
Well maybe mm well whats dad going to do for Thanksgiving no

Hell hell probably go to one of his church friends
uhhuh
yeah
till Lou says were going to McDonalds
Going to take your turkey with you and ask them if theyll cook i
Lou says he doesnt go to McDonalds
No he I remember that he used to he used to really hate it but it seems to me that he had recapitulated somewhere
well w we
But we dont eat at Burger King or we dont
Levi wanted to go somewhere one day and we were at Fred and Annettes and so Lou said well put it in the car
so we strapped him on in and y
dealing with it I think he just
realized alotof things I guess
right
either that or he just never expressed it I mean you know Scott
oh
yeah hes pretty

oh shit
or my my friend lives in Harrisburg and she wants to go to like Hershey Park
Hersh
isnt that the one that was
they have
hu
that just moved
thats the one that just moved
yes shit yeah my friend just moved there and the thing is
Its Hershey Park I dont know Christmas light
special or something so were all going out and then were going bar hopping
Im so excited a bar I havent been to be a bar in a long time
bar whats that
oh okay
they ha they have a mission over here I call it
and theyre
three sisters from their order that we live with two of us another American and myself
and of the three sisters one is another American
and then the other two are native Taiwanese people
oh alright
so at this point
My other two companions speak much better Chinese than I do one will be finishing next May
the other is just a gifted person and
you know just picks up real well so you know like s
And how long has she been here
tha the one thats gifted
p
I mean picks up well
she re she
she started when I did and last March
she had studied for two months
oh
in the states
and then this summer sh
before
oh
uh she went back and studied again and the way they studied they concentrate on
speaking and vocabulary so shes done extremely well
wow my
but shes shes also about thirty five years old
oh but you know
a and a teacher
oh okay but there is something about
you know you have it or you dont
you know
I think thats true
th th its a gift because my niece Suzy
you know she had learned German in high school
mhm
and then she got a scholarship to Germany
so her first year of college was in Germany
mhm
and then when she came back
mhm
um she continued at
U W Madison
and while she was there she meets a guy from
mhm
Holland
hm
well theyre married now
you know
but they went together for a couple of years you know while he was here and then his time was up and he he went back and then he came here and
and within
I would say about a half a year or something like that maybe a year
then she took Dutch
you know
mhm my gosh
and speaks that very fluently
and I thought well gee I didnt get that
you know so she knows German and and Dutch ah
a and it just flows she just flows
you know
yeah I think theres some relationship
between German and Dutch you know I think if you learn German
I I just have a feeling you can probably pick up Dutch
with I had asked her about that but theres
uh
N
ye to some extent but then you have to know which is which
oh I see
I you know maybe maybe lamp lamp in one and lamp in the other
uhhuh
you know I think
uhhuh
e she said there were some words like that
but it is if you want to say like a different language
yeah yeah
hm
I mean you know
Well now tell me ho
yeah o
ho ho hows your mother
Because I just I just wrote you a Christmas card Lucille and I put it in the mail
oh you did
alright
yeah
yeah
So hows your mother doing
good
good
um
uhhuh
I you know tried to get home
last it was a month
you know and Ill
Im going to run home tomorrow morning and take her to mass
mhm
and then bring her over to my sisters
because I I dont know if Ill get home before Christmas
mhm
you know again
mhm
but I try to
you know get there yeah
but I can see
um you know she i
each time I go home I feel like shes slowing down more
you know not being able to do all the things that she used to do
and now with the Winter you know its a little harder
mhm
mhm
Today is a beautiful day
but
on Tuesday
we had the biggest snowstorm of the season
oh youre kidding
oh it was something else
oh how much
uh
how many feet
eh some places went up to twelve feet twelve inches
ohmygosh
up to a foot yeah
yeah
oh
and it started in the morning l like when I went to work it was raining
and you know they said it would turn to snow
uhhuh
and it just kept up and it turned into sleet
you know
and by afternoon it
uhhuh
was no later in the morning
the snowflakes were just coming and windy
it was windy
oh
And
oh
thundering and lightning and the snow is blowing
it was an unusual
I forgot what do they call it
some kindof a
snowstorm I guess they called it
but it
yeah when you have lightning thats unusual
yes now I didnt see any of the lightning
directly
but I did you know how out of the corner of your eye
you know you can
uhhuh
you can sense
you know it all lit up
I saw in in the snow
uhhuh
hm
Now I did hear on the
I think the T V news
uh
you know one of the weather guys saying you know how he
he actually saw it and it was fantastic
It had to be because it would come through the snowflakes you know
mm
mhm
well then
it was our power kept going off because the snow was so heavy
and so I I think it was maybe you know pulling the lines down or so
Sure I bet it was
and then
yeah and this is you know I work at Saint Catherines and thats
you know near the lake
it takes me twenty minutes to work
its a good twenty minutes you know when I drive
mhm
okay so the power kept
going on and off and then the sister said
uh they had to wait until that power really came on
um but they told me they said you better go home
you know and this was shortly after two thirty oka
mhm
so I
you know got myself all bundled up went out and it wasnt uh freezing
you know cold but it was
mhm
bitter cold because of that wind the wind was so strong
mhm
i it wa
yeah the wind chill I bet
mm yeah maybe
So
I asked
you know everybody in the lobby you know before leaving
um you know some of the sisters some of the workers some of the residents I said
whats the best
to do take the freeway
or and take the city streets
the city streets
dont take the freeway
you know and so I thought okay you know because thats you know
high rise you know and I thought
mhm
So
I started out ohmygosh
I got
mm
I was just Im in
you know where I work its right downtown
After an hour Im still downtown
mhm
mhm
mm
and cars are
struggling in it was a nightmare a nightmare
because they
were they able to get out like and salt the streets or not
no
they couldnt keep up with the snow no
No it came too fast
yeah
and
oh
and it was just and you could see everybody was trying to get
get out from their work
So we were just jammed
sure
it took me
yeah
t until ten to five to get home
uh
so there was li
how do you ho
how do you usually go Lucille do you come in on you know
I take
like ninety four or
yeah I do take ninety four for a while
you know there is a a section that I take
uhhuh
and
uhhuh
So I I am on the freeway for a while
but
mhm
I didnt you know take the freeway but then I heard other people who took the freeway it was just as bad
and some people it took them four hours and some even five
mhm
hm
oh so then I didnt feel so bad
you know that I was the only one
yeah
you know that
yeah
everybody everybody did and the wind was so strong when the
even
in town I mean in Milwaukee
uh you know with your buildings around going down a s
you know into section or or so and the the car just rocked
I mean with the wind all of a sudden there would be like a squall
mhm
mhm
mhm
yeah
hm
So
Now changing topics have you talked to Mary at all or
oh
y yes
Father Larry or
yes
uhhuh
um
I wanted to tell you that one too
I still have time
I
okay
oh thi this other sister said theyll tell me when its time
yeah theyll tell me its one minute left
okay
oh okay
Because I but I want to just kind of
You know after our reunion in the Summer
uhhuh
and I think it was
Larry or Mary I dont know that said you know what about us getting together some time
and so we said well lets set a date you know so
uhhuh
uh I guess
you know after they went home and that and you know checked on the calendar calendar
the last weekend in October we went down to Larrys
place
ah
How nice
yeah and Mary left earlier you know she went
she left on Friday and I was going to go Friday after work and I thought
uh when I was younger I wouldve done that
you know and I thought no way am I am going to drive into Chicago
um you know when its dark and
mhm
you know and in with that rush
you know so I thought Ill just leave early Saturday morning which I did
mhm
mhm
and got down there around nine
and then we they said it there was a monsignor who had died
and Larry was having that funeral o on Monday
hm
mhm
and so he had some preparations to do
this was
mhm
uh
you know a very eh
oh I know the monsignor was his uncle from his
what moms side
oh his his mothers side yeah
yeah yeah
because I heard her talk about him
yeah and he was it seemed like a very
prominent person
you know so he
uhhuh
right we caught the Fox network will you put it on my table will you put it on my table
we caught the Fox network one hour
condensed version
okay
They ha they have a condensed version they
oh is that ever nice
they cut out commercials yeah you better not unplug that thing youll be in megatrouble
I ha b the phone is I left the portable phone upstairs last night so the battery ran out
okay
So I have I have the phone from the living room in the bedroom with a s cord stretched across so I can lay on the bed of course
yeah
so thats why Lee almost tripped over the phone
oh its only the second quarter
I thought it was the fourth quarter
yeah see thats what Im watching too the second quarter
oh bummer
Its the second quarter here
So anyway the Packers the Packers have the Packers played yet
But
yes
this weekend okay dont tell me anything more
yeah
okay
but I might be able to follow that
that game sometimes they replay it
sometimes they replay the whole thing
so you get to watch all three hours sometimes Fox replays a one hour
highlight and its so weird because the first time
we watched the one hour thing
It was like alright you know so y you get all set up and everything like that a all of a sudden its like
wait a minute second quarter you know and
That would be great
yeah what they do is you know all those long boring plays
yeah
you know like when they go but you know those are kindof fun to see too but
yeah
I mean its better than better than seeing no game at all but Id rather see the whole three hours
oh really
oh for sure
Well I was there today
oh that right its Sunday night
yeah
oh its at Lambeau then
yeah it was at Lambeau
Well I know I know we won because you said who did we beat and Isaid today you little brat who did we play
Cincinnati
oh
Is it a good game
yeah it was the second half was good
oh the
So if y
if you are are covered for time
then dont bother watching the first half hour just watch your second half hour
so the second half is exciting hu
right
yeah it was good wa wa wasnt exciting wasnt an exciting game but
Lori taped
It got better
Lorit taped the
uh was it the Packer Viking no not the Packer Viking I think it was the Packer Bear game
uh
W yeah with the Packer Bear game Lori taped it
that was awesome
and
that was aws I mean it goes right down to the last
two seconds Lori was
yep
I was there
Lori
Lori taped it one night she was exhausted and fell right asleep and so I told her to put the tape in I I couldnt stay up you know I was too tired it wouldve gone until like two in the morning
yeah
So so I just didnt
I just didnt watch it either so the next night
Lori was I think she fell asleep or something and I watched the whole game and I could hardly
keep myself quiet
I know
the next ye the next day Lori said
well you know how was the gam
and I just looked down to the floor and I said its good you got to watch it and dont ask me anything else
and so then she watched it the next night I had a meeting to go to I didnt get home until one in the morning
So
I I came home and she was just finished watching it she said how did you keep quiet while you were watching that I said
oh it was so hard I said did I give it away when I
when I you know when I told you and she said no but youknow you made me want to watch it you know
I and I said are you sure I didnt give it away and she said no I cant believe this the thing goes back to the last two seconds you know because
at first you know you figure theres fifteen seconds they got go all the way down the field you know this is not even going to be close and then they start making it and you go
My gosh theyre going to get down there you know
yep yep
that was a good one
We I I got tickets from a parent
uhhuh
for that game a parent called me up and gave me tickets to that game
Wow what a sweetheart somebody is nice
yeah and then he called me up the following week and he wanted me to go to or it was last weeks game
against Tampa Bay and I
oh
Now do you go with this guy or does he give you the tickets
No he gave me the tickets
uhhuh uhhuh
I went with a teacher friend of mine
oh
so
I am so disappointed that
that I mean Im not disappointed at all I cant use that word I take it back
uh its so bizarre that you would call me

I was in the post office room and this other guy was going to get the package and I get the pictures and this the people are so nosy here
shit I probably get like raped and killed and drawn in cord theyre probably going to sell me into white slavery on the way youknow they do that in Morocco
oh yeah but its I mean its i I mean people Ive been to Columbia before I went to Columbia Im like theyre going to skin me alive and it was this really civil place and Ive been to Morocco actually I was in Casablanca
it has a very modern airport and
you know it depends what youre looking for if youre looking for the casbah and like hashish bars youll find it but

I was planning on staying until like January the twelfth
Well thats fine so then you just co
so I dont want to fly out of Casablanca
or you could
you know you could make it round trip to Madrid

after that
so basically the sixth
uhhuh
I think wait let me check my little book here
uh
December this is all free for you right
Wha
this phone call
yeah yeah
oh thats cool
this is all fucking free man were talking for free
okay so wait
oh bud man I miss you I miss you so much I cant tell you
oh girl get your bony ass over here and well like party
Well I am going to get my
my ass is bonier too like Ive lost weight and everything
Youre have the most
you know because I Im like Im like a dog in heat Im going like
I mean we lose we lose
I cant I cant do anything about it
So
I mean I dont know how they take it
I dont know
I I dont know
I dont know
Its k its kind of hard
for me to even
try to
see if theyre disappointed or not
mhm
uh
yeah
I dont even get disappointed as much as I used to
Because I cant take this serious because this league is is is sort of like a joke league
Ridiculous
Thats like division three
I told you about that time I watched a division three game
thats right
nah
It was the funniest thing I ever saw
This is a joke league
The more I stay in it the more I dislike it
mm
But
dont know
Then I wonder
It would probably be a bigger joke if you wasnt there
For your team that is
oh I dont know
I mean
its just not like
its not organized its its not orga well organized
Its not
mhm
I dont know
You cant really take it serious
Like I said
Have you contacted your agen
have I
yeah I talked to him
Hes looking for stuff now for you
nah
I mean I to I mean Im Im go Im going to stay
Youre staying here for next season
No
oh
Thats what I meant
No
mm
Have I ever said I was staying here t for next seaso
No
Thats wh but thats what I meant
Its like is he
keeping his
ears open or whateve
I dont the thing is its like
e
His ears can be open but there are not there are not any like jobs until the summer
yeah
So I mean I probably wont be back here
So Ill probably be somewhere else
Im saying but
Youre right
But Im just saying like usually teams by now should know what they need
You kno
Why would you know what you nee
I mean if theyre like lacking in one area you know what I mean
and they have like a set team right now then they might know what theyre looking for next season
Well the thing is eh eh players juggle around so much
Im talking about even like the native
players they they switch teams so much
So you really
you cant say that until you know who a I mean what native players are going to be on your team
mhm
okay
So I mean this isnt like the N B A where you you got guys who
there are definite guys coming back
mm
So I mean I m people dont put out
the teams dont put out any orders until the summer time
Thats when
they trying to get everything together
Rochelle asked me for your address
Shes going to write you
man bitch get ahead What she wan
Because I dont kn oh I dont know
oh because I was telling her
I forget what I was telling her

Would you ever bungee jum
Maybe
But I doubt it
Only if there was a
yeah I cant I cant say like Ill I never will
yeah
I cant say I never will
But somebody would have to push me
I know that
Because I definitely couldnt just jump
Why no
And I would need to do it at one of the places that had the real big pillow underneath you
A real big pillow
You never seen it at West Beach
They have like this bungee jumping area
You dont go up that high or whatever
But underneath theres like this huge huge like balloon pillowish type thing
No
I havent been there
in case you f
I havent heard of that
in case you fall or whatever
mm and havent done any research on bungee jumping either
I havent but I just saw it because its like right out in the open

So anyway
I use to think I wanted to go skydiving
mhm
okay
Interesting facts
Were going into those hu
You know I I used to
um
yeah
yeah I used to want to be a astronaut
you know
But
Did I no I didnt want to be an astronaut
mm
I used to think I might have wa I might want to be a chef
oh
oh we know you cant do that now
uh
If I went to school I could
Its a little late
Ive tasted your food
Shut up
eh
I wouldnt want
I wouldnt hire you in my restaurant
But if I went to a school they could teach me
okay
Some things cant be taught
But see I never like
cooked or whatever
I always do something that just requires
me to pour some sauce on something
well
I dont ever
cook
okay okay okay
I dont want to go into my cooking
I dont want to go into it
Your cooking your your cooking
your cooking represents you
I dont want to go into my cooking
your cooking
What what are you sayin
I
The effort you put into your cooking represents you
It does not
Thats what Im telling you
So all people do is put sauce on me
ha ha
No Im saying
that if you dont put much effort in your cooking
then that
that means that you probably never will
Shut up
It wasnt like you had anything to do
It wasnt like
You know you didnt have any like
uh duties or
But its uh I mean
jobs or anything
okay
cooking has never been like my hugest priority
Im sorry
Yo your hugest priority
My most biggest
Your most biggest
Whats your huge
hugest priority as you call i
um
I dont know
Me
You
Im saying what is your hugest priorit
Schoolwork

okay
Schoolwork
mm
Well go for that one
Ill take schoolwork for a hundred
yeah
No
I I gave the answer
I said what is your biggest priority
See
And and you got to add the
the uh you know
the statement part of it
No the statement comes first and then the question
I kno well
But I asked the questions I mean I I I gave the answer first righ
So therefore you got to you got to eh
a
eh fill in the facts
Whatever
Its the reverse of you know Jeopardy the
oh okay
The reverse
Did you talk to your momm
You understand what Im saying
uh no
She wasnt home
So I left a message
I had to
put some onions under my nose so I can
and close to my eyes so I can get some tears rolling
So so I can start sa sounding like I was sad
So
Did she call you bac
No
I dont know
My mom I I the thing is I dont know
how often my mom checks
checks her uh answering machine
Because
Thats true
Because I remember over the summer you said she didnt check
because when when I
when when I was home
I did all the checking
She never checked
Like once a week or something
mm
But I mean I dont expect I didnt tell her like to call me back or nothing
I just told them when I was coming home And and
when I expected them to pick me up at the airport
The twenty second righ
No maam
Arent you leaving on the twenty secon
No maam
On the twenty thir
Yes maam
Exactly
Youre just bright
Thats the problem
it was very stressful when it snowed

but so Jacob is sound asleep
yeah
Rachel is Rachel is crawling around the kitchen and Dougs making pumpkin cookies
oh boy
and Im making spaghetti sauce

playing with the phone cord hopefully she doesnt pull the phone off
down now is is Rachel running around yet or
shes pulling herself up
yeah
and that type of thing and she can crawl wherever she wants and her latest
thing is that she gets up we have blankets on our we have a fire place so
right
you know the the brick area
yeah
she gets up there with
its all covered with blankets and then she pulls herself up on the the
I dont know what you call it the fireplace guard thing
and she stands up there and she kind of bounces her knees and she laughs
because she thinks shes doing something really cool but thats about the extent
of her you know
well how old is she now shes
ten months
shes okay shes a month older then
just a month older so shes probably doing the same thing your daughter is doing
yeah yeah Sarahs yeah crawling around anywhere she wants and
yup
pulling up and standing up and she has let off a couple times
and stood still and then she laughed
yup
thinks its hilarious
like when I go somewhere and I put her down to take off her coat she doesnt want to sit down so she just stands there
uhhuh
till she falls
oh
but dont you
do you find that she she
duck
understanding everything you say basically
I
I mean
think she does and when it her name is being spoken she like turns and
yeah
yeah
looks and
Sarah knows no
theres
I dont know if Rachel knows no she doesnt like to act like she does
well she looks at you and then laughs
like
you dont have to do this
yep
so
yeah there its a really I think its a pretty funny
yeah she it and Jacob just loves her
these are all
Tom yes yes it certainly is
its either its a love hate relationship
so
because its so precious
Sarah I love you and then the next minute its like Sarah Sarah I told you no

I I just I called home
I called some number three three six three six three zero

that sounds like a store number or something
oh wait I know what it is its blockbuster video
oh well there you go
yeah my doctor is is not in thats what shes talking about
am I good or what
oh yeah thats what I called
now I know Im like
are you working there over the winter
yeah
oh blockbuster oh Im so tired
I really really really dont want to work
well maybe you wont find a job
I know its kind of what Im hoping for
do you really really need one
kind of but
I figure Ill just get a job next semester
yeah
which is what I said about this semester but I think I really will next semester
so
I really dont I dont know I could work in the factory
for like a week
mhm
and I mean that would be cool to like pay off christmas bills and all that but
I dont know I just dont want to
will they hire you
yeah probably
and so it was like so did you work there last year last christmas
yeah
oh okay then
will you see Milton if you go back
probably I mean I assume hes hes still working there and all
yeah
actually I wrote a christmas card to him
oh
so
I dont know I dont know what to expect with that but
I gave my japanese presentation today
oh yeah how did it go
you know what Im talking about right the one about you
yeah
it went well except theres this one I wrote I emailed you I think but theres this one part where I talked about how you your hair was so much blonder
and that you look like Tori spelling and its really really funny and I completely blanked out I dont know I just went
I went oh my god I completely forgot the entire essay
then I had to skip over it and just go on to the rest it was only like two sentences though
oh no
mhm
but I just completely blanked Im like what
oh god oh well so I couldnt just stand there like
you know so I just went on with the rest but
and then everyone because I then I talked about you and Milton and it was like
what did you say
it was like because well its really simple japanese
yeah
well I sort of had to describe like whatever and I was like
then Sarah met Milton
and Milton was from Venezuela and he liked the salsa too
and then
but Milton didnt speak english very well
he spoke spanish
Sarah spoke a little spanish and everyone just started laughing so I guess they understood
so that was good that they understood at least because it was really simple but
it was just funny
and then like
and I was like but Sarah was happy
I did not understand any of it and then
and then the last is like well now Sarah is in California and Milton does not write and Sarah does not write
but Sarah is okay
shes taking spanish and shes doing very well
so funny
okay
the other people that gave I couldnt understand a word they said my friend Kai
yeah a little bit she helped me with my computer
uhhuh
thats so I didnt have to cart it
oh that was the main thing
yeah that was the main thing because if I would of had to
the other stuff I had to put into huge garbage bags basically most of it was in garbage bags
mhm
mhm
I just threw everything in the garbage bag and
and put them on this big like rent a cart its like from the unit office and then I
uhhuh
uhhuh
I had to wheel it all the way to Theta which took so long
mhm
and up a hill it was so exhausting
oh boy it was
and so if I wouldve had to have my
computers on the cart it would not have been good because I couldve like
uhhuh
well they couldve
gone over a bump and they couldve fallen off
they
they couldve fallen off definitely its not good to have computers bumped around
so they
right so may basically drove me
oh thats great
and
yeah and she helped me carry them in
so how many trips did you have to make back and forth
oh altogether three
uhhuh I bet you were tired
oh Im still tired I havent like
mhm
Im really tired my room is not even completely what
moving moving is hard
moving is hard
yeah and and no one really helped me other than that I mean
like Mira and Josh just sat there necking when I was in the middle of packing
oh great
theyre just so lame Im so glad Im leaving them
oh its not very fun to be around somebody whos
they just theyre so weird mom its like theyre not normal people
like how
long story
well tell me we got time
but
oh good point okay well its like
Mira doesnt really care that much about other people its like
she seems to be nice but its like she
I dont its really hard to describe
but
shes kind of superficially nice but shes not really thoughtful and
she well its not that shes mean in anyway shes not its just almost like shes nice and its just so blase about things she doesnt care at all
considerate
mhm
about anything like about how people feel
and oh for example
this is one thing
one thing thats been really on my nerves lately I dont know if I told you about this was that
Josh basically is like living in the room the only thing he doesnt do in here is sleep and then doesnt matter because when Im sleeping I dont
mhm
care if hes in there or not
uhhuh
you know what I mean
uhhuh
but he doesnt sleep in here but he spends all of his time in here basically
mhm
so
so you dont have any privacy at all
no I have none and I have to ask him to leave if I want to change
mhm
and or go somewhere else to change
uhhuh
which is pretty ridiculous
so this
yeah so the thing is
basically
what a frustrating thing so basically
Josh like likes to play this game called mech warrior
mhm
which is this really stupid video game and its on Miras computer
mhm
mhm
and him and all the other guys on the on the floor like love playing this game
uhhuh
so they all crowd
oh they all come in and do it
right and they all and they do it at the stupidest times
they do it at two oclock in the morning
that is really inconsiderate
actually thats the latest theyve done it sometimes its to twelve sometimes its to one
mhm
mhm
but it it its like final week and they they were doing it at one oclock in the morning
mhm
uhhuh
I had a final the next day
well
you know thats really really inconsiderate and Ill
and it was
Ill tell you the truth thats one of the reasons that
I dont like coed dorms and its not that I have anything against
you know guys and girls being on the same floor
but I think that its so much more unruly
and
you know all of these things that youre experiencing
I just think
I dont think it enhances the experience I think it really
you know makes it a more stressful
well guess what
tiresome experience
Im not going to be in coed dorm anymore am I
I know
its going to be a single sex dorm
I know
its in one way
you know what
did I mean
did you have some pleasurable experiences at the dorm
sure I had a couple
a couple
some random pleasurable experiences
did you make some people some friends with people that youd like to maintain
yeah
yeah
a few
like one girl I tried to get a get to join Theta her name is summer I dont know if I told you about her
uhhuh
yeah you did
but yeah shes really sweet
uhhuh
and
I like her a lot
well be sure to keep in touch with her when you move
yeah I have her number and everything
mhm
so
yeah shes
I mean its not like youre far you can come and visit her
no its five minutes walk so its not a big problem but its just like
uhhuh
and she can you
you know you can have her come visit you
honestly though I really dont think I like any of the people here enough to really want to maintain a friendship with them which is really a a really a shame
it is
considering I mean I made friends with joy so quickly and
mhm
and Ive been here a whole semester and theres no one Im really close to
mhm
and Ive tried
mhm
people are just arent willing its really strange
well
you know sometimes you mix with a group and sometimes you just dont but I
I guess
but you know look at how
but Theta is I mean Ive Ive made more friends with with people in Theta than I have
well thats my point obviously you know you and Theta chose each other because you have a lot in common
you know dear
yeah
and you know thats whats so nice about it it is you feel kind of simpatico with them
and
you know theres theres a a meshing theres a chemistry
right I really like them
mhm
I mean
not all of them are friendly but its you know its a huge house
oh of course
so yeah its really cool
so I think that arent you glad that you made the decision to change
mom I really am
I really especially for the last several weeks have been really miserable here
mhm
really
well Im sorry youve been so miserable but boy it sure reinforces your decision doesnt it
yeah seriously
mhm
so Im really glad you guys convinced me to move
um not until after mid January
Or
Actually a break I think not until after February
Well
Because Ive
weve got assembly and chapter and then I have another retreat
And I st I have to prepare I have to write that
paper yet
mhm
for the fifth phase
I did the research now but
uhhuh
I havent been able to write it yet
So
I I they have I need to have done
by the
second week in February
yeah
oh
So
okay
Then we have our meeting down
uh south
So
And after that
I think I have a little bit of time
So
But actually Im not I dont feel
so tired like I did
oh good
okay
So
Because you were sounding like you did
A little bit
yeah it did
When I first got back I really was tired
Id be
I was
I believe it
I was exhausted
yeah
actually
But
I I
I cant imagine why
No
No I eat right
right
I understood why
But
it so it took me a little bit
to get
time to get back
mm
yeah
get settled but
Now I I feel
like Ive
Im in in the groove
And
Good
And now its its
I I think kind of working with the unknown also
Thats part of what I
oh
I know
Probably is is in the hopper for me too
mhm
And th that will probably not be
defined this year the first part of this year
So
Probably not
oh
yeah right aw
right I talked to your mom on Sunday
ah great
How are the
um
I think okay
She was a little breathless so I dont know what I got her from
But the kids were there
Because Colleen and Tim had a party
So I dont kn
ah
oh they were baking cookies
Thats what they were doing
ah
Anyway sh
I think theyre fine
And
I told her I was going to call
So she was concerned if you got her letter that
said your dads tests had all turned out alright
Yes
Its it was here when I arrived
So
okay
Yes
I did get that
okay
yeah
Did you get the last letter I wrot
It should have come just these days or else it will come yet
No
okay
yeah
yeah
I I put a list of where Ill be up through February in in there
oh okay
yeah
okay
I wasnt sure wh theres been a threat of of mail strike here
So I I wasnt
really sure things were going through
So
oh
okay
no
I decided to send it anyway bu
yeah
After your fax I didnt even expect one
I didnt look for one
yeah I Ive I
thought you probably wouldnt
But I
I jus I had a little bit of time and
so I decided to write
mhm
Well good
yeah
I didnt
Thats alright
oh
Thats alright
yeah
This is this is eh eh a good exchange
e yeah I thought so
Right
so youre having a very heavy winter hu
Well we are
um we just missed a storm last night
It went south
oh
So we
We missed
a potentially a heavy snow
I guess
They tell us we still could get some light snow
But
oh
Yes
And then it warms up
And now there are bare patches in the
snow
And in th the grass is showing
oh rea
o
But we had ice on top of snow
oh
Thats yucky
yeah
So weve got areas that
still look like
well Cathy was here over the weekend
She said it looks like tundra
And something
In some of the places
and it warmed back up to the
yeah
twenties and thirties
So
ah
But yeah it
I eh w potentially in for a good one
I think
yeah
Well it sounds like it I was its even been on television here
You know some of the
mm
The snowstorms and the cold weather
The there have been some cold
yeah
yeah
they have too
yeah
yeah
So
But
d did I write to you about my trip back from Chicag
Well you just wrote that you got stuck in the in the street
On the way back hu
o oh
um
Well we were all stuck in the street
oh
one time or another
But I didnt get stuck till I was out here
oh
okay
I in front of the house
It just took four hours to get back from Genes
ah
From Loyola University
Well was it snowing the whole way bac
No
It was raining in Chicago when I left
oh
uhhuh
And they had s
uhhuh
they had said it would not
h the snow wouldnt hit
southern Wisconsin until later in the afternoon
So I
I was
aware of that
mhm
But I was hardly across the border when I hit snow
oy
And from there on it was
Slow going hu
Slow going because it had rained before that so that had
turned kind of icy underneath
oh we thats I I hate that kind of driving
yeah
But the trucks were very careful
Which was
uhhuh
w was my salvation
Thats I get nervous when they go flying by
yeah right
But they kept their distance and went slow
uhhuh
Anyway
Well they must have been nervous too
yeah they were
yeah
So
yeah
Anyway it
I mean its not
I dont mind snow so much
It just would have been more fun if somebody had been with me
I was by myself
I know its kind of you think oy if I end up in the ditch area Im al all alone
you know
yeah
Right
So
And I had to give up my Toyota
And
Did you
I did I had to give it
Youve been pretty lucky actually
I know
ah
I had to kiss it goodbye
oh
So what d what do you have no
I have a thing called the Pontiac Sunfire
oh
Its
I think its a new
Is it big
Its a new model of something
Anyhow its very nice
Its also a
uhhuh
a compact car
Its al hea its a heavier car than the
oh that is good
uhhuh
Toyota
But
uhhuh
its its very nice
That was kindof a
joke around the place
hints
say goodbye to my car
oh yeah
oh Well youve been unusually fortunate
I know
Yesterday we had eh the team had lunch with the other team
uhhuh
And they
Joe is such a card
yeah
So he com he comes into the
we were at Heinemanns he comes in with
a a trivia game that we should all play
uhhuh
And then he pulls
something out of his
out of an envelope
Anyway
He they gave each of us
a gift certificate for a manicure
Youre kidding
no
oh
Thats too much a
For the ultimate in pampering
oh
I would have preferred uh a massage
Well Ive never had manicure so Ill have to see because a real manicure
I think involves a massage of the fingers and
and hands
uhhuh
So
I wanted to say what about my feet
oh
No actually I was so taken back I didnt know I hardly knew how to respond
I I can imagine
oh
Right
The second
Of
of
A second edition of the
uh a giant newsletter arrived here
eh i wa was here when I got back
So
mhm
oh
Good
I hadnt seen it yet
yeah
Well it it wasnt there very long then
I mean
uhhuh
It just came
oh it just came
oh
yeah
yeah I guess it does come first class mail
I think it does
yeah
I looked at eh not that I
in talking I I realized that I saw that on th
envelope
yeah
On the outside
yeah
But uh thats right I appreciated your reflection
Very nice
oh
thankyou
About
Your
wife
oh
We did our video too
Did yo
Well I thou I yeah
Thats what I was coming back from Chicago
Thats what you were doing in Chicago hu
yeah
yeah
yeah
How did that turn ou
It turned out okay
yeah I mean I I would
Did i
it would give me courage to do something like that again
oh
Good
The
e
the
people who are doing the video
a I dont think are professional professionals
So
He just put the camera on all three of us and left it there
uhhuh
uhhuh
um
And because of that
theres a glare on my glasses all the time
oh
yeah
Which of course I dont like
And I know that
from doing the video with the the
recruitment video for the Salvatorians
when Carl Leclaire did it
uhhuh
those
guys made me tip my glasses down a certain way
And then they angled their cameras so that they didnt get a glare
oh
yeah
yeah
So I know it can be done
yeah
But
Anyway
uhhuh
Were
its circulating throughout the province
We made seven copies and sent them around
So
How long was it e did you make i
Its between I think forty five and fifty minutes
oh
uhhuh
But e
I I think we did an okay job
I mean you cant do everything in that amount of time
oh Id like to see it
yeah
Carolyn can you believe sister Yosha die
yeah
I know it
That was a real shock
yeah
She had liver cancer
b Gene told me
yeah
Thats what Lucia wrote when Gene and monsignor were were uh gone she wrote a fax for us and said
mm
that
well right after you know Shosha died
And and
explained that she had liver and I guess it had invaded the stomach also
Stomach
yeah
yeah
i
Instead of being built in the wall theyd be free standing
yeah but youd have to fasten them some way to the wall
uh well maybe yeah
Youd have to fasten them
They could just be they could just be tied to the wall
That would be a no big deal
Maybe
Maybe not
yeah
Maybe not
yeah
Whatever i
we c yeah I I agree and Leona does to
We talked about it
And I said to Bonnie mention it
And I said yes thats right we cant let that stuff sit there
Although the basement is nice and dry
But its just not
oh I know its d I know its dry and everything its
yeah
yeah
its not the its not the condition of the
items its the fact that kids are down there
No
unsupervised
yeah
And I cant believe
its only going to be a matter of time before they start
Yes
yeah
filtering through those things
I would have to agree that that
is a possibility
I havent seen it happen because I we do go down there
when theyre there
But yes they could be crawling in that stuff and
coming up with something that would be
Well it I I I feel so incredibly guilty even asking
No
But
No I I think
You know I mean
Th maybe maybe we could do something different
Maybe we could actually partition somehow
and enclose it as opposed to trying to because if we put it on shelves
theyre still going to be able to get at it John youknow
I know but I think if theyre on shelves with a curtain they would be less likely to start
Well
Well youd be surp
I I dont know
A partition sounds whatevers cheapest
We just
We just had
Whatevers cheapest and you think is best
We just
We just witnessed Steffie and Stacey down there who were told not to go in the bedroom
They got in the bedroom and found Christmas present under the bed
mmhm
mm
I said y when you tell them not to go in the bedroom what the hell are they going to d
Theyre going to go in the bedroom
mmhm
Its only natural when theyre alone
mmhm
Thats you know we were told to not look in there there must be something really good there
yeah
uh so I
yeah
Well anyway well well see what we can do about that
Its
Its just that you know some of the things are really
Some of the things are really
You know
I it might look like junk to somebody else but it has value to us
Yes
I appreciate that
Thats what I to thats what I told Larry
I I s told Larry I said you dont know what
And and by e
yeah
why something is important to them
Its not important to you but you dont know why so yeah theres no intent to do anything but
yeah
but protect it so it doesnt get
Well and if Larry feels that way how much more you know all the cousins when theyre down there
You know especially you know some of the younger ones
yeah
You know they dont know
yeah
E e I mean Claire is five years old and she goes up to my office looking for scratch paper sometimes
Thats right
mmhm
You know and and and they just kids have absolutely no idea what
yeah
value something can have So
yeah
Thats right
okay
okay well
You know
Th its its been noted and well take care of it
Well take care of it some way
Well I I feel really a and also note that I feel incredibly guilty having to ask you to do that
Because
No
I dont know why you should
I know youre doing a
Well yeah but I I think youre right
I think there is
oh
and Leona and I talked about that very thing that theres reason enough to be concerned
eh to put it in some kindof a condition so that
nobody disturbs it
And even though you know somebody might think its uh
mm
not worth a hell of alot thats none of our affair because
yeah
to you guys
yeah
uh
hey were con were con were confused about you guys address
o
Is it one three two four or one three
okay
yeah
Its one
One three two four
Excuse me
One
Its one three two four
three
t
And is Meadow
yeah and thats
Is Meadow two words or one wor
Yes
Its two words and theres an l n besides
Its Lane
Meadow Lane
But it dont make a difference I guess but yes
I see you last letter just came
So there so there
so there is no Meadow Street
No there is not
Thats right
okay
But so Lane is important but I mean not yet because theres no Meadow Street but
Thats right
There might be
some day in the future you never know there could be
okay
So it is one three two four
yeah
Thats right
O
yup
yup
And what did you sa
You noticed that my last letter wha
That you addressed it Meadow
instead of Meadow Lane
But thats not a
oh
concern
Right right Now did that last letter have
because
a bill
and
Yes
an and and
also an envelope to the s
to the ban
Yes
And that was interesting
I have it in front of me
I went to the bank with this
And he said I dont know why you brought that here because thats a receipt
that John has for a check
that stop
that was stop
payment
Right
But
N
E he said
They it said on that
that
It said on that thing that I got that if I dont mail that back
in so many days
then they wont indeed stop the payment
oh
So you got to mail it to NationsBank
No no no no
NationsBank is a Visa payment
okay
that
a c separate entity altogether The
Alright
Bank Onedojabe
yeah
is
is something that
I thought I took care of the stop payment over the phone
This is
Then
okay
about a month later
then about a month later
I get this thing in the mail that says if you dont mail this back in a certain amount of days
we wont stop the payment
To Bank One
So then I had
No to
To Bank One
and and Eileen told her mother and her mother said I dont want to hear it
yeah
oh
oh
n dont tell me that
aw aw
oh really oh
So

So she decided to go before her
Well I guess so and thats what the nuns were saying that uh Nellie was waiting for something so

oh I think thats it
And then
Shes had a dinner every year
yeah yeah its so expensive couldnt believe it
how fun
I know
So anyway
but yeah so what else
oh Steven
a couple of weeks ago had a pain in his side
brought him into Elvo and he said oh I think hes constipated and Im like well thats possible because I did run out of fruit
and Steve is like a big fruit eater you know
oh
How funny I ran out of fruit
yeah
So I ended up giving him an enema type
not a real enema but like this oil thing
uhhuh
and everything was fine and then today he laid back to have his hair rinsed out you know shampooing it
yeah
and he screamed in pain and and
pointed to the same spot
uh oh
So Im like oh whats going on
So
I just kind of you know said oh youll be okay
and then about a half hour later hes on the f computer room floor
crying
and Im like Pau Bob whats wrong with Steve and he was complaining about his stomach again
aw jeez
So we brought it him into Elvo and then
He said he
he said he either had problem with his kidneys or appendicitis
oh no
So he tested his urine and i nothing showed up in that so he said its most likely
his appendix is sore
and probably inflamed
and so it probably inflamed but he didnt really want to do anything
No you mean because its obviously not
you know
0
that severe I dont know
going to
oh how funny
so he said just wait it out and keep an eye on him
So Im like oh
yeah you dont want it to burst or whatever
yeah
oh usually they well youd think theyd send him in for an ultrasound to look at it
I would think so but maybe because of the holiday
you know
yeah
I dont know
No its Rosie got a half hour oh yeah Lacey says who is it oh
Do you have to leave
oh do you have to go
No
oh okay
eh no I said he just said who is it so
oh
aw thats scary that
oh tell him I said hi
I know
yeah he just walked away I wonder if
okay
oh brother
Well if he has pain are you going to take him to the hospital any more pain
yup
yeah yeah and it was funny because hes like
and when you take him to the hospital dont go anywhere else but Lutheran General Im like Lutheran General what
ohmygosh
an an and then Bobs like well we go to Lake Forest and and I and I real quick spoke up Im like
he doesnt like Lake Forest right in front of him
oh he doesnt
No I dont think so he didnt stop me you know he didnt correct me
so
Lutheran General I wonder if they have like a special kids
they do its that they have thats uh pediatric emergency
because its so big
oh I see so they know
so its a special unit
yeah hes like no if you have kids that need to be operated on thats where you need to go
they know
oh really
yeah so anyway I thought that was interesting
So hows wor
I was going to say thats I was going to say thats good to know but it doesnt do us good here
Im stupid Im so stupid work is okay its better
Jack was like Jack was Lutheran General right
thats funny
um yeah I
Is it
have gotten to know
what are you
the people a little bit more theyve theyve been there for two years all of them and
yeah
yeah
so
I was like the n the only new girl that I think theyve ever had
wow
maybe one of them anyway so
so what are you doing though
working as a nurse doing at a medical center so its like taking blood
oh
doing helping with procedures
yeah
um cleaning doing reception stuff like that
oh wow
its just all different things
yeah
but I dont know if I want to stay there for a real long time but its nice now because its only five hours a day
oh wow
I know its kind of
thats nice
I it is nice because
eh when I first got here I got this job and it was like eight hours a day eh w sometimes it was twelve hours a day and I just got I was so overwhelmed and
uh
yeah
because like I felt oh I got to do stuff at home and Im just not getting time to do anything and I never got to see anybody and it was just a month but it was really overwhelming
yeah
yeah
just to have a fulltime job right away
yeah
but
I bet
So now this is this has seemed
this is better for me
good
so I like it
thats neat
yeah and then what else
thats
So thats good and
what have you guys been doing for fun

getting ready for Christmas we made a really big gingerbread house I just wrote you a letter so youre probably going to hear all this again
oh
You g you guys
We had we got a
gingerbread house
made a big gingerbread house one weekend
yeah
we went away
last weekend with Leiths work
oh really
because yeah they
where did you guys go

yeah it is
was but its yeah
funny because y I dont really like the ocean
you dont well I dont like swimming in it
No I I I know I dont like it
I mean its pretty to look at but
I
yeah well thats I like sitting out there but thats about it
thats about it I dont like I would never want to live on the beach
me neither
it scares me Im afraid to get eaten by a shark
Well
So
when I was down in Florida with Maureen Quinn when I was a freshman
right
we were playing I mean just jumping up and down into the waves
and a jellyfish did I tell you this
yeah
No
It stung me under my arm and my whole side was par not paralyzed numb
oh my gosh
for like three days I mean it was weird
and ever since then Im like I am not going into that water
yeah I dont like it
because you cant see the stupid jellyfish
No you cant see anything
and theyre clear
And what if a shark came up when y I mean youre in the waves
yeah
I know it sounds ridiculous but it does happen here
oh really
oh yeah
so I dont know
you mean there eh youre not youre not exaggerating
well I dont think Im being like
a big baby
no
I dont make a big deal about it Ill go in the water but I just dont go any more than my waist
yeah
I just dont like it
eh its dirty
oh Amy how weird
yeah
yeah its just its so funny to think that thats a different place
I know it is its so funny
I forget
I forget that you have different sit circumstances
I know like
like we were just talking today at church like nobody decorates here like puts light on the house or anything
oh no
and I guess this street in
in one suburb decided they were all going to put lights up
uhhuh
so everybody was went and
like the group went down to see these lights
oh youre kidding did that
on the street and all it was was Christmas lights on houses
Its funny
isnt it funny they were all
that is funny
Its on the news and
oh Amy
like everybodys in like talking about these people with Christmas lights out
oh is that cute
I know
thats so funny
they just dont they just dont do w
at all like the decorations that we do
w no
and its just a different yeah different feeling
you should see I went overboard with my house this year
oh isnt it fun though
ohmygod
Ive got greens and lights on everything its just its so fun
oh shut up isnt it pretty
yeah it is it looks really cool
I love that

uhhuh
and I missed some other people that I always see
yeah yeah
but
oh we had a big
um sixtieth wedding anniversary celebration in Milwaukee
mhm
so alotof our family were
oh

I might not
well lets say it this way
Im Im committed here for another year
yes
which would end June and the last part of June
uhhuh
but Im going to be asking for an extension of four four months to carry them
uhhuh
to the end of the school year
oh yeah
because
they they fail you know in the third quarter because Im on vacation already or something and then on the
mhm mhm
final they cant make it up they cant
mhm
do it and so theyre failing
mhm
so I want to stay here until the end of the school year but then it might be the end for me
uhhuh
every year gets a little harder here for me
yeah I suppose yeah
with arthritis and
uhhuh
and so your arthritis is bothering you
things like that and I dont hear too well
uhhuh
uhhuh
thats another thing
but I might leave an open door yet
that if if they feel thats its okay what I do here you know
mhm mhm yeah
if they need me or something and if
yeah yeah
if its the will of God then maybe Ill just take like a three month vacation
uhhuh uhhuh
in the states to try to get my hearing and and eyes and ears up to
get that ticket
cleared up
taken care of
yes
thats why Im kind of like Im kind of on the fence right now
thats I know exactly how that
with my decision
how that is
and do you do you know how that is
I know exactly how that is yeah yes
youre going to be there forever hu
yeah it looks like it
anyway um what was I going to say yeah I remember those days is that
six seven years ago already when we sat in that little room
and watched T V with sister Alcott

well first of all communication is very difficult here
yeah yeah
telephone they they dont have any okay
yeah
I mean we have one here but its you know busy or
youre so far away from it when the call comes
yeah yeah we tried once before and they said you were sleeping
well I wasnt really
I went to bed early because I had a very heavy day last Saturday
uhhuh uhhuh
and now this saturday I was house cleaning
oh yeah
Th they take their two weeks at at All Saints

the ones take a good week or more
We still h the cook is not back yet from Christmas vacation
So
everyone whos whos extra busy of course you know whos doing the cooking like tonight it was Benny and me
mm
uhhuh
I mean e so all the people who are working
uhhuh uhhuh
I mean y y its like the people who are working get more work
and those who are retired sit in their room and read the newspaper
It blows my mind
It it really does
It really does
And I mean
As you
said
As you said its quite a different experience
huh
Its a different experience you know
And I tell you what weve got a I I mean I really appreciate our province
our sisters the way we do things etcetera
ah
okay
yeah sometimes you have to move away to come back to appreciate that
I mean you know its
and it its and its different
Thats all you can say
Its
mhm
okay
Thats right
Thats right
different and and theyre
And and this experience is not the
you know the same as if you would be on a little community
oh thats true
How many are ther
Theres eight of us
and then we have a a ninth one who some in three or four days a week
Its th
sister Gabriel Mary whos the
Malagash sister whos going to the university
Tsk ah
So
okay
And and
So its different
And st
And the superior is only here half time
Well see thats what when Benny was here she said that
And I couldnt figure I just
couldnt quite understand how that worked
mhm
mhm
Its a its a different experience as I say
Its
um
Well its its an experience where I think Francois did too much
oh
And so y you have everybody not knowing really how to do
ah
So its
yeah
Its its its a growth experience
You know as each people are called to do more theyll theyll grow into it
uhhuh
Got you
okay listen
Something else interesting
Last
Wha
night last night
tsk
the woman from the paper here in town came
uhhuh
interviewed us
Its probably going to be in the paper under in the probably on the weekend or when they do the religious section
oh Sabe Sabrina
Sabrina Hayes
No this is
Britten
Her last name was Britten
oh okay
um
I dont know I dont know her Sabrina is the one who interviewed me
I I dont
okay
Sh she was probably the educational one
This is the religious
oh okay
um and she had just done an article with ministers on the call
uhhuh
She referred to that a little bit and that was in last Sunday
oh good
So this should its going to be quite interesting to see what she does with this
oh great
Well save you a copy or send you a copy
Well probably send you a copy
okay
okay
yeah Id be interested
yeah
So you can see if were
You can see if were famous or infamous
oh shoot
yeah it will be good
She was she I she was interested
Shoot
in
uhhuh
uhhuh
tsk
She sat there a long time with us and took a pic
took several pictures
mhm
mhm
So it would be interesting to see
She doesnt select them she said
To see
mhm
yeah yeah
when they ch
and and what happens with the article
uhhuh
So
So if it comes if you get an article youll know what um
She called a Mar she called Frances Margaret
a while b since Christmas
mhm
wanted to come to do an interview with six of us
And Fr
mhm
said there were seven of us
uhhuh
So
Of course there were a number of people who volunteered not to be part of it
I can imagine
I can imagine
oh golly
yeah
And um how was your moms birthday part
okay that worked out
it i
it worked out in the end
We had Gracie had called to make sure that
mhm
we werent ha planning it the day that mom would be at dialysis
uhhuh
They said they were going to change the schedule so we chose Saturday
and made sure that moms brothers and sisters and everybody else could come
Good
uhhuh
tsk
uhhuh
Well when a when we were at home between Christmas and New Years Gracie called just to double check
mhm
And they had changed moms schedule back to Saturday
mm
So she maneuvered it worked it out so that mom would go at like at seven oclock in the morning
oh good
So that meant she came right straight from dialysis
Sosh
uhhuh
uhhuh
be at home for that little open house
uhhuh
mhm
They you know
yeah
The the people with the
that have the van that was supposed to because so she didnt have to get out of her wheelchair at all
Its just too
oh good
painful
Its just too painful to get her in and out
Its
oh Im sure
Im sure
oh
And shes getting but th but it was nice
Tsk her her brothers and sisters that were in the area were there
And
mhm
Dads well dads its a sister inlaw who came came for it
Thats were thats where I guess they would um they get involved in initial public offering stock offerings
mhm
for companies
yeah
Listing companies on exchanges creating ah ah depositories receipts in the United States for foreign companies
and so forth
Right
All sorts of things just to raise capital on public markets
mhm
And then theres the debt side which is um the side which deals in bonds
mhm
they they go out and they try and find buyers for bonds
Right
Institutional investors and so forth and then youve got the um
ah the traders the stocks and bonds traders and
Right
And the for I dont know if they do foreign exchange but they Im sure they do even have that hedging and stuff
And then aside from all those clear cut kind of special ah
ah focus services theyve got their at least the big ones like Goldman Sachs and others
have their strategic advisor services
Now the Goldman Sachs that works for Deutch Telecom
mhm
in privatization
um they are in the equity side they Theyre doing what David did they
Right
Theyre working with us to to um help sell us as a company
mhm
To investors
On the public market
On the stock exchanges
In Tokyo NewYork Wash ah Frankfurt London and so forth
But the the the investment banks that are driving me crazy are always strategic investors
Because they show up and they what theyre out there to do is theres alotof companies that they cant either cant raise money or they cant raise the type of money they want on stock exchanges
mhm
They dont have enough credit worthiness to go out and get a bond
mhm
um ah so the way they want to get capital is through offering a strategic stake
in their companies
Selling a piece of the company on ah ah pu ah you know ah that changes hands privately
Selling a piece of the company to a foreign investor usually
But theyre selling it to yo
yeah
oh
So for example I mean without ah referring to any real deals
mhm
um companies will come obvi ah you know theres theres alot of ah alotof telecommunication companies that that
ah that come out and and they look for
um for for a you know for a strategic ah strategic investor
Theyre looking for someone to buy they might be wanting to privatize in two or three years
mhm
But um in the meantime they want to shape up their company so theyll sell what twenty five percent of the company to a private to a foreign investor
mhm
And the foreign investor will come in and and and restructure the company and then together theyll go ah go to the stock market
Right
And its an opportunity its a big opportunity for alotof companies out there
But is that what youre dealing with thats your realm of
Partly yes
um I mean I work in an area ah which is involved in international ah foreign investment
mhm
um and and actually a whole range of of foreign business
And um you know one area is our global partnership
with Sprint and Francetelecom
Right
And another area is our foreign invest foreign investments
okay
ah
And so ah we get all these like I said we get all these investment banks coming to us and ah
and theyre li theyre theyre salesmen and theyve theyve theyve got something to hock
ah some company that comes down and theyve said find us a buyer and ah it it ah
it really can get on your nerves
Gosh
So what were you going to go to Tokyo
fo
For example
Or what did you go to HongKong fo
Well those were ah those were just consultations
Wit
um ah
Not with whom but like with pe with companies that you might invest in
With with investment banks with
mhm
Companies
huh
yeah
Gosh I didnt know you were into such the ah financial market area
Well its yeah thats I mean unfortunat ah its actually been quite good its been quite interesting
mhm
ah I never knew anything about really that area before
I mean Ive taken Cordons financial markets kindof a class
Reall
mm mm ah
But you hadnt taken i
No I hadnt taken anything like that
thats bizarre
so I never knew really you know ah what ah how to you know how you ah what what you were
you know what a strategic sale was what
mhm
investment banks do and so Im new and thats actually quite interesting learning that
I know well because they want to be totally irish
even though like
ow ow Robby is not even irish so whatever
oh okay
but Dave is kind of weird so you know
yeah
but yeah
is when I think of Megan I think of

oh
so if you decide you want to like take it for credit can you take the next higher course next time
I hope so
it would suck to have to take that class again
yeah but
I think they would and I I dont think Im going to take because I dont need it for my major or anything so
yeah but you know you could so have you decided on a major
no
but its not going to be french
I dont need it for my major what the hell Jo
well I dont need it for any major except french and Im not majoring in french
you never
you could do comparative literature and you have to be fluent in another language
yeah yeah
yemenheneheh
well I wont do comparative literature then
weenie
so what are you majoring in today
the
fuck you
well good great posterity fuck you
comparative literature probably with a either minor or a double major in french
cool
yeah me
okay so Im not majoring in anything youre majoring in but
youre like good thank god run away
ooh so ooh oh oh oh I have a Tim update Tim update have you heard about this
mhm
I havent heard anything

aw
The suns shining like it has almost every day this year I just you know
Rita youre making a big mistake by not running on over here
I know I know well it was it was such a huge decision Diana I was just like I
yeah oh I totally understand
agonized over it
uhhuh
And then I thought okay
I I re and part of the thing was
I realized well you know if its such a if youre agonizing over this so much then maybe I should just take a year off
And
mhm mhm
You know travel and work or just do whatever
mhm
So I I mean at first I well I first said okay thats what Im going to do I felt like such a copout
Really
And then I was like no way this would be really fun well I think it would be really good for me too because Im afraid Im getting so boring
Borin
So I need to go have
oh yes deadly boring
Because of being in school for so lon
So
yeah
O god
I guess
Im a little worried
Is it
So
am I becoming borin
No
Not at all Diana I think you have much a much different approach than I do
um
and Im going to try to get some of that next year
Yea speaking of getting some of that um
I know our calls being recorded but
Hows it been in Scotlan
Well it hasnt been much fun Diana

O mygod Diana I mean I wish I wish you could have seen it
It was it was it was prob it was probably one of the weirdest things that has ever happened to me
um
I mean just in terms of like just all like all the layers of issues that this young man is dealing with
It makes Jeff
Are I think
Look like um like
O Je
Doctor Ruth or something like that I dont know
Yes exactly
Wow
I mean this young man has problems
And but hes
okay so then
But has he decided that youre his friend thoug
Is that that because thats the issue
Well
Because theres lots of people walking around with problems
I
but as long as they dont bother you
yeah
No I think when I think after that I was very cold to him and I think I was pretty clear about
Tha That he had gone over the limit
Right
So I mean so so were cordial definitely
I mean I
Right
Say hello to him and whatever but I mean theres really no reason to have any other contact with him
mhm
Whatsoever
So okay
So hes
He was never in the picture and hes certainly not now but and then who els
oh well there is this man that I see at the lib we I study in the library almost every day right
mhm
And there is this guy and hes I know he does classics because I saw him at a classics seminar that I went to
okay
But I always see him and Im going to introduce myself to him because he is so cute Diana
All right
He has like black hair and hes Scottish
mhm
wow He is absolutely lovely
And he always smiles at me he so he knows who I am because he always smiles at me when I walk by
Right mhm
He like wel he looks up and he smiles directly at me so
Youve got to work this thing like I did with the breakfast man

Of course

You know what I mea
Yes yes
Yes so far Ive only been an auditor but
Right right
Oh thats an excellent
Anyway
Thing
yeah Ive
yeah yeah
Ive been developing I dont think I ever brought this upon the email a junk food analogy

Friends from elementary school

Do you have any pictures left of me or did all your friends take the
yeah
No I have some
I have a whole album full
oh shit but not the good ones though all the good ones have been taken
of you
Tsk
yeah so Im going to have to make copies and get copies from you
uhhuh
mm
Tsk
yeah
See I told you
We did our high school reunion and then now
and yesterday we had our elementary reunion
That was yesterda
yeah that was yesterday
uhhuh
It was weird
oh
The changes that
that
you know
people go through
Their faces
We well hell thats elementary school babe
I know
And I dont think Ive seen any of them like
tsk
after that
in high school when st when I was still here
So
it would have been eight years
Yesterday before I saw them again
Bab
Let me let me let me tell you something
yeah
yeah
I do not keep in contact with
anyone
not one person
that I went to elementary school with
I remember when I act
uh
just randomly met up with all of them
Did Nate go to elementary school with yo
oh hell no
He went to ju high school with me
N
I met him I met him sophomore year of high school
oh
oh
A friend of mine introduced us
huh
So you did not keep in touch with anybody
No one
How about middle schoo
Because we didnt have middle school here
We dont
Well junior high
So
I mean the one person I keep in contact w with from junior high
yeah junior high
I only do that because he also swims competitively in a college
And I see him like
ah
at swim practice
whos this Bab
No this is
No
Jake Arms
oh
mmhm
And Babs is from high school
mmhm
So it gives you an idea babe
We
Well well were we were very very close
We are ca close
bunch of gals
mm
Im just making fun of you
We were
We like each others company
You did what to each othe
We like spending time with each other
You did wha
Wha
You did what to each othe
hu
Wha
hu
I said we like each others company
You know Im really upset with you
Wh
Well
because Zambo
has
his girlfriend is on the swim team
Ryan
his girlfriend
is on the swim team
Berko his girlfriend came up for the weekend
So theyre having a good old time
mmhm
Not fair
oh
Poor Matthew on the other hand
oh
But
poor
poor Munger
Wh
I I had like a hearttoheart with Munger
uh
two nights ago
An
oh that boy that boy is not in good shape
Wh
He misses Becky that muc
Hol
sortof like the antithesis of that
What do you mea
Well
its something I would need
Hes enjoying it really huh
Its something I would need to talk to you in person about because its so long and intricate
Really
I mean
Tsk
You know Hiam hes really nice
Shes
the antithesis of what he is to an extent
I like that word antithesis gosh
yeah
Y y yeah h h you have
oh I used it twice in one sentence I u thats overused
um well
Pretty much
put it this way uh Munger has a feeling that its easier for a woman to cheat on a man
because all the woman has to do is say yes because she
uhhuh
always going to have
men hit on her
Whereas in a man to cheat on a
uhhuh
like his girlfriend
is much more of a
conscious thing
because he has to actually go up to a woman and hit on her
Right
mm
okay
so I had
I that thought had never occurred to me
I always thought that men would cheat on their w
girlfriends more than the womans w
cheat on their boyfriends
And
that has
factual
basis with him
Wha
oh Becky has cheated on him many a time
and thats one of the
I thought only once
oh no
I just found this out
oh man
And
Well I was just telling him some experiences of mine with her in Spain
and just telling her
oh my
Ive got the biggest grin on my face and Im chuckling
god
Cindy is apologizing profusely
I look up at a
about a like a half a se you know half a minute later
And
and Penny has this
you know
I think jokingly hurt or jokingly I dont know what
face on
Its jokingly mad jokingly hurt
Right
But underneath those jokes
I just theres a part of her that goes
tsk
I wonder how often shes done this and I wonder at what
points and activities shes done this
oh my
So I just laughed
And I just I you know nobody else said anything and
god
It was fine
What a
day
Tsk and she said you know I said listen you know Id I would like to
you know think
you know Id like to talk to you about staying in touch and and things like
that
And I said I know that our friendship will never be the same and I dont want it to be the same
It was not
I said
sh I said you know when I think about you which I dont do very often in fact
I dont think I ever do except
you know at certain times which
I think st I mean I saw a look of shock on her face and Im like
you think Im still thinking about you girlfrien
you know
so I
So it was just funny it was the funniest thing
And I just thought once I got that closure
face to face and that connection face to face I thought you know what
I see the disdain in her face still
I see her eyes saying
you know
I dont I you know I dont respect you
And once I saw those eyes of of disrespect
yeah
I just thought
tsk I dont want this relationship I dont need it
I don I dont need
Girl you have come like four million miles
Well
you know
when you got good friends
you get to realize the shitty ones who
who think
you know that youve always thought were good friends
So
Right
So yeah its
Wow
You have just fucking gotten some shit done
hey but you know I have to tell you
I am very very very very proud of you
Because
your last letter
to me
just showed great great
great great great strides
of being able
to share
your personal deep feelings
Reall
Yes man
You I mean
It was really good
That means alot to me Valerie
Really
Well e e I Ive s Im just
I was just sitting there going

Well you were just you were just saying how youve you have really
you know
great days and you have really terrible days where you just want to go off
eh where you do go off into the mountains and just cry
yeah
And how you really really deeply miss people and things like that
And I just thought good for you
that you
are sharing that with me
Because its one thing for you to feel it
Its another for you to actually write it down and tell me
yeah
And I was just very proud of you
And I just had to tell you that
ohgod
thankyou
That I see I also see great

Girl sometimes I just miss it because you can play with the words
so much
And I mean that had
such feeling What you just said had such feeling to it
I could never express that in Spanish for my life
Give it time
Give it time girl
ohgod
Does this thing

warnin
It gives you like a minute or something like that
oh good
yeah
yeah
So hey g Wild Asparagus is coming to Cincinnati
ohmygod
Let me just
get a little more wet
That is
not
fair
That is
just not fair
I tell you
I
if I dont dance
soon Im going to
die
I bet
W e
I mean
Youre doing tons of
that I pay
Youre doing tons of traveling arent yo
um
When I go to Madrid I dance salsa
hey girl
Wha
You been getting an
Girl
Girl its such a long story that I thats why asked about the time I dont even want to embark
but it is just like the most fucked up
story okay
Wh when I first went to Madrid for that month
uhhuh
uhhuh
I met this motherfucker and I swear to
god I would marry him
Youre kidding
No Valerie you dont understand I
think for real the first time in my life
I was
actually in love
Youre kidding
But were here doing exciting stuff today Mike actually went out to a shooting range with some
mhm
ah
other guys in the neighborhood you know theres alotof international people in this neighborhood from
Canada Denmark Norway
France
Australia United States
Lets see what other country Singapore Indonesia
China Taiwan HongKong
Let us see where else
um the Phillipines
um those are they folks weve met so far anyway
and so from England
you know just from alot alotof place that
some of the guys went out to a shooting range today and Im home with the kids
Were trying to make granola you know you cant buy it here and
trying to find the raw ingredients is a treat and a half too but we finally got everything and made granola so that was our big excitement for the day
okay
the you you dont get to carry weapons around do yo
oh no oh no no one does
okay so you go to the shooting range and pick them up there
yeah they have
I dont know if its a military shooting range or a private one or
military one that private people could go to but
basically if you pay your money theyll let you
shoot whatever you want theyve even got the out there for goodness sake
oh yeah I mean
oh well
so
gee I thought about buying an S K S you ever heard of tha
uh
oh its
I dont know what that is
its its basically a Chinese assault rifle its you know sortof war government surplus actually
Russia has them and China has them and the Russians are supposed to be better
but like they come to the United States in a crate for like a hundred dollars
hm
and this is a semiautomatic weapon with
eh you know you can buy
a case
the rounds fort in a readily
and
so Charles has one
and I tried it out and I decided gee I ought to get one if I was ever going to get something but then I worried about keeping it safe
mhm
thats the thing you know if your house ever get broken into or something
yeah then you feel so responsible for
something happening and its a little bit of overkill for deer hunting you know
so
No its perfect for deer hunting
I dont know I personally dont care for guns is i
yeah it would it would be perfect
yeah I I just dont care for guns
yeah well we we we c we arent supposed to have them around where I work Im
Im really disgusted I got called in this morning
when you know I take care of these little juvenile delinquents
mhm
and they
uh one of them complained
they complained about me eating cold cereal on the unit youknow when I work at night they dont feed us
So hes complaining about me eating cold cereal
mhm
and practicing the acoustic guitar
while hes locked behind a steel door trying to sleep
mhm
and you know it just
petty they just trying to play power games and
but the boss said well okay no guitar
so that eliminates an hour of practice a day that I got paid for by the state while I was sitting there watching the kids with the
you know hes complaining about the other guy snoring
so what do they want anyway
Hold on just one second theres something quiet down
oh Eddie and Sarah have to fight whenever the phone rings you know
oh
But anyway
mhm okay
so but the weather here is incredibly nice its
just about every single day its bright blue skies and sunshine
and
mhm
It now its down in the the teens and the twenties sometimes although it did get a little bit warmer the past couple weeks of
yesterday and today its back down cold again
yeah
But its really not bad sight seeing whether I told Ruth and Charles they should come in the Winter time theres
theres hardly any tourists here so nothing is crowded
and you can go sight seeing and see all kinds of stuff without worried about really heavy crowds
That would be nice
dont have crowds around the square anymore hu
Well theres plenty people there but theyre all flying kites
oh okay gone to flying kites
so
thats the big pastime Sunday is the the
Sunday is like family day and kids day
yeah
So they all go there to fly kites although this Sunday is is uh Chinese Lunar New Year its the biggest holiday in China
and its kind of like Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one
Right
and its called Spring Festival now
yeah thats right it
a big deal
It is the new ye it is the new moon I
I sta when I get off work I see tha the moon get older and older and older as it
you know when it was just a real sliver yesterday
yep
so
and this is supposed to be the one day in the year that these monsters called the neons can come and
bug people so everybody
wheres red makes lots of noise and shoots off fireworks to scare away the neons
to keep the neons away
yep
okay
so tha
wow
ready for the new year
and we got some fireworks and the kids have their little red lanterns to scare them away and
Sarah is actually quite concerned about it I mean she goes Mom I dont want the monsters to eat me
oh
because youknow theyve been reading stories at school and everything getting ready for the new year
and all you just have about
but Eddie and Sarah
We just had Valentines Day and I went to a Valentines Day dance and you know like half the women wore wore red dresses
um Typus this is the one that
Tsk oh wait I also have one quest
There are
there are two
there are two problems that Ive sort of been working on in
you know in e w
off and on
um one is
you have three schools
exactly n people at each school
each person at each school knows at least n plus one of two n people at the other schools
Prove that there at least three people who all know each other knowing knowing is mutual
That
yeah
oh you know who you should talk to about that one
Dav
No
Wh
Lets see
Who do we know thats into statistics
Stev
Thats not statistics
Its a combinatorial problem
Thats statistics
Theres a there is
No
Yes set set sets of n probability
is probability and statistics
Probabil
No no no
Its not probability it
No I know
But
prove that that it must
It involves stati i
Right
But I I mean Ive gotten Ive
like
e there I tried I tried the simplest way to solve it and that
that isnt
that isnt enough
And then Im working on the second one which says something like
okay
at the first school you have n people who know n plus one
people
out of two n people
That means that they know n squared plus n of two n people
theyre right yeah
I I I its not going to make any sense until I sit down with a pencil and paper and s
Like
okay
okay well
Thats the only way I understand maths is like
okay
I dont
Sorry
until Ive worked on it
I like
No it depends on how complicated i
okay well Ill Ill send you e if you want Ill send you these two questions that Im working on
yeah
That would be good because
Because
because its like
e
e theyre theyre w
theyre not difficult problems
And
and I understand exactly whats happening in them
um or I mean I understand plenty of whats happening
Imsure theres theres alot more that I dont understand or else the solution would probably be really simple
um
but i its its really fun but really
but e I wish it it were were going more quickly
um
But I Im just
Im really really happy this person
you know posted this list of things
And the the really the really cool thing about it is
yeah
um
like
there are alotof problems that
like there are some problems that that because of the geometry center
I was able to to
like give answers to immediately
And then there are others
What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in hal
yeah
Now what does happe
E Im no Im not sure on that one
I havent
D do you did did you did you save that list someplac
I have the
um U R L
okay
Because because e what I could do with the problems that Im working on is just
give you the numbers if you
yeah lets see
Im trying to
wanted to look at them
That would I mean that would be easier
Now
But
I I actually I have stuff saved in a text
Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two Moebius strip
hu
I said if were cutting the Moebius strip in
in half
wouldnt you just get two Moebius strip
No thats not what happens
W why no
Cut a Moebius strip in half and youll see
But w
cut cut in half which wa
Lengthwise
okay yeah
That I didnt
Draw draw a line in the midde
oh wait never mind
yeah
That wouldnt work
The the
draw a line in the middle of the Moebius strip and cut
along that line
W okay I
Yes
Thats right
I see what part of the problem would be then
And and the thing that probably was the most humbling thing
is you know the
the description of
of the circle in Boston
yeah I saw that
um
Eye to the eye
yeah
Wait
ah
and
I dont know I I Ive never dealt with imaginary so Im not sure
yeah I mean well it has to do with complex numbers
And Igot
When hen I get back I I
I
can try to explain it
it to you because
someone did explain it to me
And i
i
I I dont completely understand it but I think
Now I want to figure it out
After going through
I I
know enough about complex numbers that
I theoretically should have a clue if I like
okay well I certainly I I
maybe then then you can when I get back explain everything you know about complex numbers because
Its been a long time
um
Well
between now and then you can figure it all out again
Cool Im really hoping whoever it was that hit my page in the geometry center liked it
Like
they were looking at it three times so
Three times
Yes
How do you know it was the same perso
It was
It was like three times like in a row so it was like youknow flipping back between pages
Thats really weird
Well I mean this is this is when theyre making decisions
So its entirely possible that youll get a job at the geometry center and then I probably wont
But
you know
that would be
oh really
well yeah it depends like they tend to get more at their international meetings than domestic ones
thats interesting
so
yeah yeah
yeah I just got my confirmation a couple weeks ago of my my my paper
oh really are you doing dissertation stuff or
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah well thats cool
but all we have to send is the abstract
yeah see thats how law and society is but not
yeah Im surprised you have to send the whole paper
yeah I know oh well
well yeah what can you do
oh well last night or actually
friday night and saturday morning I went to I got invited to the embassy
the
was very cool
US embassy
yeah yeah the ambassador here Swanee hunt
cool
she
has this thing called the Vienna womens initiative
uhhuh
so where she gets women leaders from former eastern bloc countries
neat
and tries to connect them with americans and viennese women
and so I I kind of got invited so I was pretty excited
yeah thats nice
yeah yeah and I met a lot of really neat people there
yeah
I mean I wasnt as particularly as interested in the ukrainian women as
some of the other women you know to kind of connect with on my work and stuff it was really cool
right
thats nice
yeah yeah
was it a nice place
oh my god it was beautiful it was at her residence
oh
which is kind of out more towards the suburbs
uhhuh
and it was really she has like a ton of art there
oh yeah
yeah a lot of different kind of
art I mean you know all original sculptures and
right
really interesting stuff but she never showed up for any of the things I was really surprised
she wasnt there
no isnt that odd
thats odd yeah it is odd
yeah I thought so too
considering its that its her house and all
yeah really well
I mean all her staff was there and there was you know a lot of different
right
you know diplomats there but I dont know
oh well what can you do
yeah yeah
hows Matt
Matt is good he theres like total chaos at the UN as you might imagine
oh
and his boss told he
this other woman who came in through exams like he did and the other lawyer
mhm
uhhuh
and said I dont know whats going to happen but theres always going to be a job for you guys
oh thats nice
yeah but theyre thinking about getting rid of the entire office
but in a way but see Matt has a permanent contract and so the UN is obligated to try to place him
so hell have to be
somewhere
so in a way it might be a good thing for Matt
yeah
if he got sent to new York or something
yeah would they feel as though theyre obligated to place him even though the US isnt paying their dues
yeah they dont do it like that no
no they dont its not eye for an eye
no its not like that really
yeah well thats that would be nice
yeah and Matt just found out actually on friday that hes on the short list for that job he interviewed with yeah
really
well thats nice
yeah so thats
how did he hear that
he talked well they said when he was leaving they said in a kind of joking slash serious way
mhm
dont call us well call you
and so hes like you know its been when was that December
right
its been a while and he hes not going to
call because he doesnt want to be like a nag
oh right
and they said dont call
right
but he was able to call the personnel office
in new York and and try to find out through there
thats good
and so then finally he spoke with this woman who knew and said well we just put the short list together
Im assuming its like three people I mean thats usually what it is
right
right
and youre on it and we have to interview people off of it the rest of the people off of it so
what do you mean
well I I guess that means that the other people on the short list werent interviewed yet
oh
so yeah
so that means inside track thing
I think what it means is they just screened things by resumes and applications
and Matt happened to be so close that they had him come in
but Matt made that interview happen since he was there
oh thats good so that was good for him
yeah and now they dont have to fly him out there or anything
right and Im sure it couldnt have lowered his chances to make the short list
yeah I mean I dont know
thats great I bet he does good in interviews
so yeah I think he I think he did well but you know its always so hard to say
well he made the short list
yeah true true true good point
well thats nice thats good
yeah yeah
well that must make him feel good
mhm mhm
thats good so
so hes like
even if he doesnt end up getting it he knows he was he was pretty close on the first try
yeah yeah
thats good
thats true
well
yeah so hopefully and hes been recommended for a promotion
oh great
and his boss is like really pushing and called an emergency meeting of the promotion board
really
to try to push he and this other woman through
I thought the boss was not liked
well hes not but I mean hes trying to I think he what hes trying to do is set things up before things fall really
uhhuh oh thats smart
and so Matt is kind of psyched because I mean things are oh and theyve been told that they have to fire one professional and one secretary
really
